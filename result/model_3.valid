i &apos;m going to cover this photograph near me . it &apos;s in my office , because i always have a mystic connection to these two men , i &apos;ve never learned both of these things .
my own research to mobile phones and the most powerful shows that 80 percent of all calls actually go to four people . 80 percent .

we &apos;re worried that texting , texting , facebook , the most prolific intimacy , is to be able to be able to do the same thing that the most important of the brain can promote , to make love more like remoteness and more and more efficient .
one of the things we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed several vehicles -- is how we believe the first autonomous computer system of the world .
for example , the brain &apos;s brain tends to make a lot of the waves of waves .
no challenging task .
now , the time is , the donor dollars are about $ 60,000 in the year for a human to go to jail .

i started my company to help communities in all the country , using their existing potential to improve the entire quality of life of their people .
and before you don &apos;t have kids , you won &apos;t understand what i mean . &quot;
these deaf people are discovering the community for themselves .
it takes time .
real guilt is just a single one of the most , and someone with syndrome is not a person . &quot;
to the people who are not far more than that .
but i found that i &apos;ve been born the kids i &apos;ve been born , so love , i don &apos;t want to imagine a life without you .
he wouldn &apos;t get the legs right .
i come from a privileged family . i &apos;ve been lucky .
it &apos;s about two weeks old . and there you are .
this is the beginning 2000 . my son , dimitri -- also here , many of you know dimitri -- went to cambodia and has built it from us , and it &apos;s built by us with internet .
think about it -- because there are other people like bill gates who said , &quot; man , you have a real computer . &quot;
latin , it &apos;s pretty rare . let &apos;s look at some languages .
and guess what ? we won it .
we have a sense of making no extra plastic systems to keep the prices down the bottom .
for a more sophisticated example , my apartment is about as alien as space .
and we can take care of the issues of the world &apos;s issues .
and to talk about a cliff cliff , i was told to be too much , although i don &apos;t know what the party is doing or attack .
wealth is going to be people who are not going to call them a viable problem .
in the subject , there are major disagreement .
none of these most important theories was a full of success .
we have fear that the world is watching .
and as a lot of this work we found something , or i found something that really fascinated me , maybe you can remember .
in fact , it &apos;s happening here -- from light to darkness in six seconds .
i see her faces very precisely .
that &apos;s not a expression of joy .
this lady here has even a particularly special face , and both sides of it are beautiful .
this thing here , it &apos;s the light that you can see when you move , so it gets a little bit of a sudden , and it &apos;s just a little bit of a time , just like brilliant that &apos;s going to do through the reflection .
i had to move this part , but only to take a millimeter .
and one thing i showed you before was , of course , a very complex .
it &apos;s losing or losing it in this moment .
the emotional band between this object and to shape them is a key of the brain , which happens before they &apos;re thinking about it at all .
i don &apos;t think we have to make this choice .
it &apos;s also a thought that we &apos;ve forgotten .
i think it takes to return to tradition of the sermon .
we don &apos;t think so much .
and at the end of the day , they all stand up and say , &quot; thank you , plato is , thank you , &quot; oops , &quot; ooh , you &apos;re , jane austen . &quot;
the other thing is that art should not explain that artists should not tell their motives , because if they told them , they destroyed the magic and we might find it too simple .
art would be one of the tools that we can improve our society .
we may not agree with what religions want to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way that they do .
absolutely . i meet how many of you , people say , &quot; is there not something bigger than we all do , else , something else ? &quot;
because you agree to be 90 percent because you have a similar view of the way that many things , and you &apos;re polite to be polite .
so he took me from places like chile -- the most salient desert in chile -- in underground mines , in the japanese alps , north america , north america , north america , and even to the south pole .
it &apos;s the largest lake in the world . it &apos;s 800 kilometers long .
and they won &apos;t believe it , but that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be called the most powerful telescope .
this hut was built by robert merchant &apos;s disney and his men when they came to antarctica , on their first expedition to the south pole .
remember , these whole wiring are people in extreme cold , in southern temperatures .
this is an interesting statement , i &apos;ll end up with it .
what people are first doing is comic book book , which is that they can look for the book , and that &apos;s fun .
it was quite a lot of people .
but how do we scan them all ?
we &apos;ve reached the 10 cents a page , if we work with big volume .
i &apos;m not sure what you &apos;re doing .
a day hand , a day , two or three descriptions of hand .
and about 15 dollars an hour , and about 100 to 150 dollars per hour , we can put materials very , very sophisticated online , and have it in the net .
the question is : is that the world that we want to live in ?
flowers are going to come up .
we all know that the earth has problems .
after that , they went from spores , went to wake up .
if you go through the landscape , it &apos;s high in your shoes , and you &apos;re trying to react to the melting .
across the surface of all the dirt .
some of these mushrooms are very happy .
this is an extraordinary rare thing .
i did something that nobody else had done .
the box of life -- you get a dvd from the ted conference -- you give earth to the earth and water , and you have both the most sophisticated and you have a little bit of the time , and you have a little bit of spores like that
i &apos;ve lived in biosphere 2 .
we wanted to know : is life adaptive enough ?
i kind of ate myself all the time .
and the doctor was looking at us to make sure that it was really good .
and everybody went to me .
and the other thing that we &apos;ve done is , in the old days , a part of ethiopia , one of these places that are amazing and incredibly provocative , and i have no idea how people do it to live there .
this beautiful picture , this is the amazon .
this is actually a very reactive .
i had to think about how to do it , and i also cut it , but also how to pick the right person to come into a hospital .
you put the break , you took blood off , you put blood , you looked underneath the microscope , put the culture on , and the culture , it &apos;s the most salient .
but we need a solar test , pit crews for patients .
and so sometimes medicine is going to feel .
we looked at the wooden lanes , we looked at the street , and we found that they were technology and education , and then they have something : they have checklists .
and it &apos;s just hard to spread .
so these are really a lot of bees , and that &apos;s very important .
so that means that beekeepers can replace their dead peoples very well , and they could keep the loss of loss .
they take their hives and their families to their families to twice the year .
honeybees are in the minority .
take a cave in new york with a million bats , now , now , there are 1,000 , and that &apos;s like san francisco in the population of half the world &apos;s population .

and then when it became a shared experience , it was funny and something that she could laugh .
i was inspired by this .
this is in 2005 .
they got two of my guys who had hidden cameras in the hidden cameras .
it &apos;s a wonderful way to spend a more powerful thing to look at in a stadium .
the idea is still in the beginning , but it &apos;s a moment .
this is ted .
and this is the cover i want to break .
now , kids don &apos;t have a lot of the time , they &apos;re a special case .
they &apos;re kind of a kind of laser structure .
the discovery of the world &apos;s natural selection is great , incredibly awesome .
this is what we &apos;ve done on this planet .
the ant is not alone .
you &apos;ve just heard this man .
i really appreciate that .

look at what &apos;s in the middle .
you look at this direction , so i &apos;ll close it here .
we thought this guy was going to be materials .
it &apos;s actually seven billion of the world &apos;s own passions , which all of your own passion , and all of them are coming together and create this world -- in their own , and in their kitchens , in their own neighborhoods .
and yet , you can hear black holes , even if you &apos;re invisible , the reason is that you &apos;re playing on space-time like a drum .
and our sun is not going to end as black hole .
now we &apos;ve never seen a shadow of a black hole , but black holes can be heard , even though they &apos;re invisible .
we can predict how that &apos;s going to sound .
it &apos;s also supposed to give a mission for space , which is hopefully going to be going to be in the next 10 years . it &apos;s called lisa .
it &apos;s closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago we &apos;ve made a little more sophisticated .
trees represent a witness .
i think that &apos;s a movement .
we &apos;re critical to the west , the view of the west , which is our identity -- the picture , what &apos;s being drawn from us , about our women , about our politics , about our politics .
but instead , i found a country that was completely ideological and i didn &apos;t get more of the time .
that iran once was a secular society , and we had democracy , and that we were stolen democracy from the american government and the british government .
i &apos;m standing here to say that the iranian women found a new voice , and their voice is my voice .
on this self , one of the size of a single , a wholeness .
there is no american compassion .

a few months ago , i got a call from a computer phone , where i work .
but it &apos;s still silent , like a silent silent cop . &quot;
she said , &quot; who is this charles bonnet ? &quot;
for example , when his favorite day went to him , he said , &quot; and who are these young men ? &quot;
and then , if you were standing , the young boy flew down , and 30 meters tall , and disappeared .
these traits of a dialogue is not in these kinds of neurons .
there &apos;s a domain in the anterior part of this fusiform , in which teeth and eyes are represented , and this part of the fusiform is active when people have the most sophisticated hallucinations .
&quot; kermit &quot; doesn &apos;t mean me . &quot;
sometimes i find them interesting . and i have a lot of images in my home .
edith widder : i &apos;ve made this footage with a special camera whose sensitivity of the darkness is very ambitious .
so , for example , these crab , for example , is rotating bioluminescent materials in the water , just like a squid or a squid produces an ink cloud .
this is what a plant looks like , actually , but a animal .
there &apos;s something little little that react to that .
it should attack the predator of the war .
one approach would be to draw a picture .
if we collide the double forest in their two strands , they see that these things look like teeth .
it &apos;s packaged and it &apos;s called the &quot;
one is to be a hippie speaker .
again , these are all the things that are all more sophisticated , scientific journals .
hold your eyes open and your head in motion .
the ability to have concepts intuitively with images of objects and processes .
if the main world is still thin , you can be able to be more adept , and hard work to be more gentle in the world .
i &apos;m here to commit to you , to help us support the way people and other creatures are making things like people and other creatures .
not through the most violent , but it allows by collective action , which comes from the school of literacy .
the other big narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons .
toyota , instead of having his suppliers on the ground , treated these as a network and trains , to produce better , even though they train them , better for their competitors .
thank you .
thank you .
we &apos;re doing two different things here .
in fact , everything is about frostbite and difficulties , and cold , challenging conditions .
first of all , we developed a little experiment where we gave people legos and they asked them to build something .
and if they said , we gave them a new one , and while they were doing this , we have the other thing that they &apos;ve built , again , apart .
there was a very nice relationship between love and the number of legos .
and i think the ceo in the principle is basically not how important meaning .
but i should point out , by the way , that in the shredder condition , people could cheat .
people didn &apos;t want them .
and we had two types of people .
now think of kids .

this is in modern conflict , because children are very easily sending into war .
the vietnamese of my mother was so bad that they were to make our history of the story , all the young and girls , and girls , and girls .
afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the population are illiterate .

if we had the chance to have a chance to be more 350 years ago , we had spoken about the future innovation of the military , about the massive industrial technology , and we could have a era of stability in the world , and we can predict an
now , in this environment where you don &apos;t know whether the potential enemy is prepared to attack or attack and whether the weapons leave the attack , it &apos;s what &apos;s most important to the environment .

but what it was immediately practiced was the variability that were dominated by our economic development -- that if the oil oil was high , our economy grew very quickly .
the same thing we do in the field of field .
because i would have been longing to see that you see this .
he called them , &quot; massive fatal , &quot; which means that they could kill up to 100 million people in the next 50 years .
until recently , we didn &apos;t need to know how a vaccine was working right now .
the main challenge for these two viruses is that they constantly change themselves .
these drugs are not cure , but they &apos;re a huge triumph of science , because they &apos;re the automated death rate of a single at least for those who have access to them .
but you know , the research that has been interested in hiv has helped us with the progress for other diseases .
this was a slow , sort of , a slow process , depending on chicken eggs , and millions of living chicken eggs .
and it &apos;s beyond the radical increase , and the huge amount of production of the e. , for example , to the point that i &apos;ve just talked about -- look at the time that i &apos;ve been talking about -- that &apos;s the life of life .
so the challenge is to advance full force .
the question is : why ?
do you think the african union will organize such a conference ?
there are some things you have to know .
the speaker who was here on the stage was , i was going to see muhammad mohamed , pointed out that we had the leaders in africa .
by suffering from their suffering people .
traditionally , the africans hate governments -- they hate parchment .
they decide what they do .
he doesn &apos;t get aid from the government , and he builds a second , bigger boat .
something that would connect us all together .
scott &apos;s the results were full of it .
and the challenge for algorithmic filters , these personalized filters , is that they &apos;re the balance of the balance , because they &apos;re all going to go to what you click first .
it &apos;s supposed to be a new way of doing it , and to new people and strangers .
and the man said , &quot; pretty beautiful , what ? &quot;
i know that you &apos;re waiting for more bad , i &apos;m just doing fun -- but now , you &apos;re just going to get a quick repetition , and then i &apos;ll show you a new material about possible solutions .
to the end of may , it will be a update on the version 2.0 , which is where you can then design the purchase of the brain .
even again , all the republicans here : it shouldn &apos;t go to the front of the day .
what i really impressed on the gulf of the gulf is that they &apos;re highly fond of the world .
and there &apos;s nobody else trying to do that , except a few people trying to use the beach .
we heard that bacteria eat oil ?
this is the kind of the ocean shot across the ocean .
when the japanese pearl harbor was flying , they were at least return .
what the brush is about to the birds , i don &apos;t want to make a more sophisticated remarks about people who clean birds .
okay , people who are being conservative when they really wanted to be conservative and really really , they should send these companies to the police to the police .
it &apos;s right and wrong .
and i &apos;ve developed a system to produce medical tags .
okay , i &apos;m more than my genes -- all together .
i don &apos;t asked you to get it because it &apos;s true , but to remember you .
they contain a molecule that we know as a brain provider .
and this is just a kind of a design problem . it &apos;s a lot smaller than a human being .
now , neurons , like trees , can grow new branches and lose old ones .
and we can actually talk about the most sophisticated .
if you celebrate these numbers , you can easily find the main rule that there &apos;s a big potential for the brain .
maybe this technology will be able to know ourselves from pulling ourselves through and put our own brain .
he &apos;s mostly working on video videos and ads with his company , the most salient census .
so we &apos;ve been prepared to show a quick experiment to show you this .
ks : no , not yet .
and he did it , he noticed a unexpected thing .
ks : so , how does it work ? there &apos;s a matrix of the internet .
ridiculous , right ?
and a few months ago , a friend of mine sent me a link to this guy , eduardo sousa .
a huge scandal for a few weeks .
but he still did this .
so his farm is incredible .
and then he found these wild plants , which is the most abundant plant .
and then they fly in the circle .
i finally came to try and try and try and do it before i went .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
what &apos;s the hell called the hell ?
at least . i think i think it &apos;s .
farmers who rely on nature to find solutions , to find answers , rather than nature &apos;s solutions .
and to move from the old fire to the new fire , it means to change two great stories about oil and electricity that are both two fifth of the fossil sea .
our fuel for mobility is three fifth of cars .
you can leave it quiet , it &apos;s tougher than titan .
trucks and planes can be realistic , or advanced biofuels , or advanced biofuels .
better light and more and so forth , and so forth , the maximum fuel system around a third .
already , about 20 more private , private pools of cheap solar cells without financial losses on their roofs and lower their own counterparts .
and what we &apos;re also replacing is it &apos;s going to be about the same cost : about six trillion dollars in net net -- although we buy more of what we have or new nuclear and called renewables , or renewable , which are more or less dispersed .
so , on outcomes , and not incentives , focus on the ability to focus on the aid , and conflict to the aid of america &apos;s energy problems .
later , i realized that what i had eaten , two of the things that i had was being made of his family .
this simple piece of view shows that donors are in areas where the least kids go to school , not funded schools . and that &apos;s where aid is going to be , and that &apos;s where aid they need most ?
two years ago , at april 15th , i called my father .
i &apos;m not trying to design the toothbrush .
we remember , and can it look at each other of my book &apos;s book , that life emerged four billion years ago -- four billion point two ?
so , i &apos;m not quite sure .
there are risks , there &apos;s a trap . the vertical .
you have time to think of what to do , and you have time to talk about art and things like that .
you go back to the future , back , back , so .
they all come from families where most of them are at home , usually the mother or grandmother , and they come to their education and their structure here .
we &apos;re going to bring them to the right and the left , so they can tell them to follow and know the consequences when they &apos;re touching orders .
let &apos;s go online . &quot;
it &apos;s transformational .
they said , &quot; that &apos;s enough for a lot of time .
you can support us . this is the task of you guys . &quot;
but i have to have my hotdog .
you can listen and join .
let &apos;s take the most example of the water .
if you think about wikipedia , in the content of wikipedia , everyone has built the greatest encyclopedia of the world , and at the end of the world , you &apos;ve created the largest encyclopedia of the world .
there are many people who have the same dream .
a website was made .
there was no leader .
extremism has become tolerance .
the modern tools of neuroscience show us that what happens there is an incredibly complex process .
we can keep the sounds of our own language apart , but not the stranger .
we went to see that by the way we were , by the way , by american babies who had never heard a second language , and they were hearing the beginning of the critical phase .
it may look like a computer program from mars .
science on one side has a very rational approach to their environment , while art is usually a emotional approach to its environment .
now i have a live over here to show you this .
let me show you this over here .
the dalai lama once said , &quot; love and compassion are a lot of time .
the profile was ripped down by a small girl whose body was burned .
it &apos;s part of human health .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we choose to be with compassion ?
the wound over the maggots .
suppose squares , and honestly , who don &apos;t like you ?
we start with a little bit of a time and then we put another one more .
then there was a mushroom designer , a computer designer .
i said , &quot; he &apos;s been dead .
&quot; did i have a comeback ! &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t get a boca . what happens ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what do you do here ? &quot;
so i went to the lobby and saw this indian guy .
marco tempest : if you asked him to deception , he said , &quot; well , magic is the only job of the job .
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to show you how closely terrorism is connected to our daily lives .
at the time when i interviewed the red brigades , i also discovered that their lives weren &apos;t dependent on ideology and politics , but from economic constraints .
i think many people actually thought i was a little bit more honest .
but especially , they went into serious design organized crime .
this money was got in a hospital in the street and the wild , and in the bar , you know .
nobody wants the most sophisticated control of his story and pursue his own customers with clients .
some of you may think , &quot; wait , wait , you can &apos;t necessarily see a car test .
clearly , i wanted to leave my head of my home , but what i didn &apos;t have seen was that it &apos;s incredibly uncomfortable to leave his favorite character .
and i really learned that , the bigger the challenge , the bigger the sense of a special performance when you get to the end .
now , i thought , the atlantic is big , but the pacific is really big .
but that wasn &apos;t a little bit of a time .
it &apos;s this little green disk on the horizon , which makes you very nervous because of the rising sea level .
we can start to make better , more sustainable , more sustainable decisions .
ze savage : why i &apos;m going to go across the pacific
this is the world trade trade on the cover of the page .
why ? why do you want to do that ? why do you want to do that ?
he doesn &apos;t see an ngo . it doesn &apos;t use any extra time .
they were able to make this .
and finally , it &apos;s about comfort , it &apos;s about comfort , you know , you feel good at places that you didn &apos;t feel good at .
and that &apos;s hard to do , if you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i asked myself , how could it be so easy to give up my dreams ?
it &apos;s not so hard to do somebody , and one day before school i said , &quot; yeah , you can miss my homework , &quot; and i gave him the wrong answers that i wrote in the night before .
we were both introduced to the back in the class , so we wouldn &apos;t have to do with the very first of the .
maybe you brought your breath and you &apos;ve got your mouth and you &apos;ve never told you , because how can you say you , if all of you want to be buried around you ?
this is french science .
well , then go .
if you look at this truck , it &apos;s the largest truck of his way of the earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the largest and the fastest growing of co2 in canada , and it &apos;s also the reason why canada is now the number three , in terms of a head .
and as a father , i can &apos;t imagine what the soul is doing .
by doing that , we remove a big part of our biggest largest energy and replacing them with the most greenhouse oil oil of the future .
the most important thing about their work is that the empowerment you can buy in every store and the millions of indian women every day on their forehead , it &apos;s a ritual that &apos;s very closely related to the institution of marriage .
and the bell shaw was born in a little bit of a while , in the blink , raised and trained in london .
i hope to convince you that complex and complicated is not always the same thing .
the most important thing is , the one we want to impact -- the public support for government .
so i was going to meet in my first tedtalk that we should spend a planet 21 billion hours a week with video games .
only 30 minutes a day for a significant improvement of mood and increase in the joy of joy .
why a game ?
how could a bit of a game that was so serious about this , and sometimes , sometimes , survived , are you in serious situations ?
there are four ways of strength , or resilience that &apos;s contributing to post-traumatic growth , and there are scientifically , in general , that you can do every day to build these resilience , to build these resilience , you don &apos;t need trauma .
it &apos;s more empowered by more exercise .
here &apos;s another secret for you : if you shake someone out for six seconds , the most powerful thing is going to be greatly increase in your blood , which is &quot; the &quot; s . &quot;
and in this project , we actually have hundreds of people around the world , and they &apos;re doing it with us . actually , thousands of people involved in this project , in many ways , in the different aspects .
and then a few people came from chicago and said , &quot; end 2007 is the slogan of chicago festival festival , the global warming . we &apos;ve got a little gallery , and we want to put it in with her reef . &quot;
wool and the other things are not just two concepts that fit good .
euclid asked , &quot; how can i define parallel lines ? &quot;
infinitely . they found . very precisely .
so we have , from wool , running domestic security workers , the proof that the most famous thing that the most famous thing is is the math of mathematics .
and their individual ideas , and their employment with this mathematical method .
this particular recursive property -- the self self -- is my opinion of the holy grail of neuroscience , neuroscience , and eventually we will hopefully understand what &apos;s going on .
this person is otherwise in the closet , and it &apos;s intelligent , but if he sees his mother , his meditation picks up and he says it &apos;s not his mother .
so if this area is damaged , you lose the ability to recognize faces .
tables and chairs and chairs -- nothing happens , just like normal people , when i show him a picture of his mother , the most low activity is low .
he knows that his arm is not there . nonetheless , it &apos;s a convincing experience .
maybe you can do this by the most , the tiniest person in the phantom .
and my pain is gone . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , the last three days i didn &apos;t have a phantom and therefore no longer a little bit more in your elbow , no encore , no more , no more , no , no , no , no , no , the pain .
and the blue is blue , f is green , one other tone could be yellow .
this is the key .
which is kiki , which is buba ?
you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a time to get the most involved in the world .
this is kanzi .
none of the things you &apos;re going to see in this video are the signals .
good job .
he learned that if he uses both hands , with his specific family , with a different kind of time , a lot bigger and more powerful .
a framework means a hut in the forest .
he looks at where the sound comes ?
because we believe it &apos;s not the biology , but the culture .
and some stars are dying in spectacular explosions that leave the remains .
on the right hand , gravity is the gravitational gravity .
and beyond it , they get new ways of change .
it was too early , but he was a moral guidance , a inspiration for scientists who were concerned about control of the weapons .
suppose we had aliens , living creatures , we have seen our food care of a long way outside in the cosmos , not only for 40 years , but the entire peak billion years of the previous world .
martin rees : is this our last century ?
and it &apos;s going to be worse : &quot; then i would make a picture of it , and a dozen year-old paper .
now , these are students , so they gave a lot of money for things like earrings and makeup .
and then we asked them again , how happy they are .
but enormous different incentives .
these are the kinds of things that belgium are in belgium .
the teams that we gave money to spend it for each other , were to other teams and the core of the end , actually , the league .
if we hear about the most popular , the high ones that are going to be made , we think that this is another one of these most amazing conflicts of the middle east that roots are so old in the region itself .
ironically , that was a time when the most successful of iran was in peace with washington , and not the destruction of israel .
this is an analogy that makes it to be interpreted , diplomacy &apos;s diplomacy , is diplomacy inevitable .
you can look for certain types of information or you can look at the different regions and compare it .
the map of port of port-au-prince at the end was not as good as they could have been , not as good as the map of california .
the trick is .
and she said to the explanation , she said , &quot; he was not an environmentalists . &quot;
this system wants to keep the status quo , even the status quo of a brain .
so it &apos;s not about my topic , the most important thing is , it &apos;s not .
we can &apos;t do anything . &quot;
lawrence lessig : we , the citizens , have to come back to the republic of the republic .
for example , some people in this room are going to be with sputnik with a scholarship to school .
that &apos;s where i &apos;m on my pen . &quot;
everybody &apos;s just a little bit wrong .
i don &apos;t want to say that the law of entropy is not true , it &apos;s true .
here in the model , you see the attack of the world &apos;s attack .
if you see fireflies in north america , they &apos;re like a lot of things in the united states , and they ignore each other .
each of their favorite parts depends on this critical region , which is the most prolific , which has over 10,000 independent cells , which each of them have been a whirlwind , a large , low , a low -- a lot of tension to pump the pressure .
they were a while in synchrony , but they were apart .
so i want to show you a few interviews with people who were going to the opening on the bridge and describe what happened .
now , you don &apos;t normally think of a metronome , but we &apos;re all running -- we &apos;re going to walk back and forth .
and on the one hand , this is just a few tons of tons , so it &apos;s pretty fast .
it &apos;s the most popular scientist in his area .
i didn &apos;t say what the list was , but she was in the order of the order , and i told you , you should look for her name , her name , or the names of her mother .
also , maybe this apple , or maybe a more , very much more , that doesn &apos;t value the right , a resilience that &apos;s not worth economic behavior , or pests or a different property that is useful for climate change and the other .
we &apos;re going to starve kids on tv .
the idea with svalbard was that it &apos;s cold , so you have natural temperatures under freezing .
and if anything happens , you can come and pick it up .
thank you .
watch your body your body . this is not right .
maybe any lady , a lady ? thank you very much .
you &apos;ve just tried two concepts -- two in the united states , and one in the russians .
insane ! i have to talk about innovation innovation -- the things that are developing , there &apos;s a lot of activity , and then they &apos;re replaced by something else and they die from something else .
i can &apos;t tell you when it goes , because i don &apos;t want the competition to know my trip .
i mean something really interesting that &apos;s going to happen here .
ok , let &apos;s talk a little bit about commercial development of the state of space .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a few years , he &apos;s ready to give up , but one day he has a epiphany .
institutions will be naked , and if you &apos;re naked , the consequences have the consequences .
the fourth meaning of openness and fourth principle is , is the magic of the world .
the allosphere is from the u.s.
you know that bees and fish live in live lives .
all around us , a medical revolution , is a revolution that will help us defeat some of the worst diseases of our society , cancer with free .
this is a tumor , dark , gray , a weaker mass , a more prosperous mass .
and you can see that the ring of blood supply disappears .
but the real question is : how good does this work work in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add a nuclear flu . it prevents angiogenesis very effectively .
but more interesting , from the study that the men , the people who have developed the most violent , had the ones that have more tomato sauce , which have fewer blood vessels that have eaten their cancer .
albert von york once said that &quot; discovery is to see what all of you have seen , and think of what nobody else has thought . &quot;
i &apos;m a college meeting at discover magazine .
it has to make fun , unlike everyday problems , which are not really good at the very best of puzzles .
one is the background of the other .
you can &apos;t make that physically , but you can &apos;t do it on a computer .
i wanted to make a sequel .
what will the point to be here ?
so there &apos;s games like brain humor for the nintendo dave , a giant scholar .
looks like a black character . where is that ?
i really believe that a girl is so powerful , so that we had to train all the training , not to be like that .
i remember my father , who was very , very violent , i proposed .
we &apos;re so used to being a girl of the difference , to be the human life that we actually made them in objects , and they &apos;ve been transformed in them .
and she looked at the eyes of her babies and said , &quot; of course i love my baby . how could i not love my baby ?
when we were there , she did a ritual where she was a girl who was gifted , with her families .
and i &apos;m going to be on your side of your life . &quot;
i love it , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s easy .
why should you turn me to turn it out ?
so , in actual process , all six teenagers were saying , and the most cosmopolitan they had made by the photo image .
but the incident took place in the middle of january , on the northern hemisphere , to seven o &apos;clock at night .
this is 10 feet away .
and what does this example show -- what &apos;s important to us to keep in memory ?
he was a very religious man .
i got a college meeting and i traveled through africa , where i asked people why they were , why they were a fractal job , which is a great job when you could get it .
and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do in some villages to the smallest level .
it &apos;s not really mathematical knowledge .
he said , &quot; if i lived in the jungle , i would just use a long time , because it &apos;s very fast and it &apos;s very cheap .
and odd , odd , is odd .
we have a computer company in ghana .
the bad news is .
instead of putting on friends or family creatures , they looked at david &apos;s workplace .
today , agile development is applied to a hundred countries , and it &apos;s enough to go up into the air industry .
fear of the street barrel . apartments do .
we &apos;re putting a couple of rules on them and we hold them up .
the conversation is going to run better . &quot;
now , when i was going to go back tonight to come here , one of my daughters started to come up here .
and we developed 10 statements .
i was a teenager when i first read &quot; anna chaplin &quot; and the famous first sentence : &quot; all happy families , same ones , are identical to each other .
i want to show you how some invisible way to look at it .
if i came to the water here , you see a silver ball , and this is the most powerful thing that &apos;s the water that keeps the water from the water of the ocean . it &apos;s dry .
and plato with all the young boys in his cave , sweeney : yes ...
i &apos;m going to show you it .
but tesla was not successful .
one thing that i want to clarify is that not all neurosurgeon is wearing the tail .
we can turn them down or turn it down or turn it down or turn .
he &apos;s one of five children .
i &apos;ve shown you that we can apply it to the circuits of the mood of depression .
we &apos;re to understand what these circuits are and what these circuits are responsible for the clinical signs and symptoms of those diseases .
evolution is actually more like a failure as a failure .
that &apos;s enough !
what we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human being , or the cockroach or a cockroach or a crab or a diabetic , the relative to the relative of this feather is to all the people we &apos;ve seen .
okay . the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , right ? it &apos;s incredible , students have tried it , and they couldn &apos;t tell it .
he does this with a plastic glue .
what we do is we take the hair as a role model , and put together with another colleagues in berkeley .
and showed that by the married papers , two thirds of the married men have children , but only one-third of the married women .
at monday , i left san francisco , my favorite , and flew to this conference .
and we go out at the end , and we look at , and say , &quot; how did it leave you with you ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous study at harvard business school about a woman named heidi chaplin .
and i &apos;ve got my hand again , and i fell in all the other women , and then you &apos;ve thought more questions about , just men . &quot;
a woman approached me about this , and i looked at it -- she looked at something young .
thank you .
they don &apos;t do it as much as they should , but they do .
so not fear was the defining factor .
but it &apos;s the middle of the black .
now , i want to talk about this in the next time , how we &apos;re spreading health care in this country , how we get information .
so they &apos;re in clean , more clear language , and that works .
we tell you that everything is fine ; it &apos;s good to tell you .
this patient is about 50 , so we can actually say quite exactly how big it is to get to prostate cancer .
they don &apos;t need the level of the audience to do the audience in this room .
and this bee was certainly thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to get this kind of thing , this flower , that flower , i get the nectar and then i get off . &quot;
and if you talk about nature , the theme of my favorite story is how is the idea of the design ?
well , we &apos;re all equally sophisticated .
the only technology here is the cheap air system : it &apos;s pretty new , and i could close a car battery , even i could close a little bit of 10 , in 15 minutes .
if a nuclear student , the grass is going to be on this disk , and it &apos;s going to happen immediately .
and now i say that i want to build a layer of games on the top of the world , but it &apos;s not quite true , because it &apos;s already in development ; it &apos;s happening .
if it &apos;s not , it &apos;s a bad thing . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
come on to a certain time , you get your drinks for half .
and then they can really do good things in different ways .
and it &apos;s powerful .
and the most exciting thing is , a community dynamic , trying to find the best news , the most exciting stories .
we &apos;ve been talking to you last year many years ago .
you also see , if i turn around this , i &apos;m not going to be very much more honest in the world .
you can see here it &apos;s starting .
this is one of our engineers .
nomads , which is actually a professional student should have been discovered , discovered the law of the inevitable , just as much as a hobby .
raise your hands .
it makes it a place where it &apos;s fun to work .
and that &apos;s why something we work on , and we even have people who are excited about it and crazy enough that they &apos;re working on it , that &apos;s really their goal .
thank you .
what brunel said , he wanted to reach for his passengers , was the experience of the landscape .
what does life make more fun ?
and part of the time they do this by building a great new facility , the basement of one of their hospitals used .
now , the industrial systems of time has been more sinister , and they have become part of the present problem .
and as brunel can we do , by putting ourselves on systems , a bigger effect .
from my persistence , the waiter signed up with his boss .
mark libeskind and i &apos;ve tried to answer the question of the very same question .
but it &apos;s exactly what the american paradigm demands .
but for the north americans , the very availability of all these things were on the market as a nuclear war .
americans themselves discover that unlimited choice in theory seem attractive than in practice .
and the parents would say , &quot; noah was more like , &quot; noah was just for the short time , but he taught us so much .
robert frost once said this , &quot; it &apos;s poetry that &apos;s lost in translation . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant rendering of pink . &quot;
the three problems have one in common : they &apos;re highly susceptible to forces that are controlled by forces .
so thank you very much .
it &apos;s supposed to replace competition .
and then we build a solar system that we can test the height of the machines , and so we can get very , very quick .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that the most important thing is that the most important thing is that the most important thing is , but as a result , it &apos;s a movement of movement .
the nuclear weapon enters the stage .
and then the 92 nuclear nuclear power , which would serve the energy , the rest of los angeles .
then you take it and put it on the screen of your television , and you &apos;re going to throw it out of the inside , right ?
if you replace the word , or the internet today , it &apos;s very real that his attitude is now very frustrating . let &apos;s hear it .
i think it was this exchange that led to personal citizenship .
ph : i hope you can understand how to do that .
ultimately , the race has won for the future to make the momentum of the phone .
mm : because it has given the audience to do something .
they produce things for 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute .
and where television has been made , what &apos;s built , is a very exciting new kind of communication , and we have the collaboration of two industries and a new way of thinking to see it .
this is a spanish architect and designers .
color can spontaneously spontaneously spontaneously , and just , if i go through new york , i think i &apos;m going to go .
it has given me suggestions -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco , and we all talk to us , and we &apos;re going to build a few of them .
the use of the city for public space is important , almost a international model .
even the bits of the airplane had french names .
he said , &quot; well , first of all , there &apos;s more girls there . &quot;
and that was , after all , i went to some of the most sophisticated and more cosmopolitan , where design landed at the point of chair that i &apos;m going to show you .
he said , you have one of the new , better chairs .
or they &apos;re going to be up to the position .
i knew , but i knew , in the offices , and when i looked around the offices , where there was no one in the idea of the idea that anybody would come to the idea , and to turn to a head of the head , to turn
and dengue fever has spread in a lot of water .
two days ago , i can &apos;t remember exactly the same thing , i &apos;ve read in a computer program , that the first time that i &apos;ve been able to take a test , that the first is the first time , about 52 quadrillion cases , about 600
we need something that was really , really , really , really , really , really , the disease that it &apos;s not spreading .
here &apos;s a typical situation : males are a female , lots of young ones .
so , the main problem is not our biggest problem .
&quot; why now ? &quot; &quot; why here ? &quot;
and most of the time i &apos;m barely cutting out of it , i &apos;m not going to get a nuclear sandwich .
look at the data available .
now , our mobile phones can now create a story of our evolutionary system .
bill gibson : your health depends on where you live .
this is my grandfather .
out of the simple reason , nobody &apos;s talking about it .
as the dawn of the way , they &apos;re going to be able to get phosphorus through water from the ground .
here &apos;s the title of an astonishing article from a computer &apos;s nature of nature , which is the discussion of the phosphorus crisis .
eighty percent of them are being said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to go .
and instead of a dose of 100 percent , we take one of 25 percent .
we have a working technology and one that &apos;s going to address some of the most sophisticated use that we &apos;re using on the world &apos;s surface of the world .
and he was a fan called the &quot; -- he looked at all the most violent and mutations to find rules and laws , instead of looking at the norms .
and in this example , you see the individual steps , but they &apos;re looking at it without being a little bit of a time .
as an architect , i just think of relationships between the parts and the whole , but in terms of designed to become a matter of business .
we were going to be on the level of the building of the building where we could build the five separate towers , but they should all be on the 60 floor to a single mass of the light .
and let &apos;s come back , a few years later , in 2003 , and we &apos;ll see that this landscape is honest , rather than rainforest , as after rainforest .
the difference is especially in the desert in the desert , or maybe the most important in the desert , which you want .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic garbage , a lot of things that have been thrown away and now on the air .
we &apos;ve doubled the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world just simply by fertilizers that cause huge problems in water quality ; rivers , lakes and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the most important thing for the most important thing to do .
but we can do that and there &apos;s opportunities .
irrigation is the largest largest education system on the ground .
have to work .
so what is this , what is that system that is that it &apos;s solar d.
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
it &apos;s not all of that system that pays out .
we interact with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biological surplus to amplify these kinds of cells -- muscles .
so this is what it looks like .
here we are , or cut the nerve free , from small parts of the world &apos;s dna and left others , and we gave us the signal -- two other ones that our hand -- signal , two other ones that we put our hand -- signal .
ak : it works good .
but i can &apos;t put an electrode in and say , &quot; there &apos;s going . &quot;
and that &apos;s our goal -- something clinically relevant to carry .
this is jesse and he puts a laser file .
thank you very much .
sub-saharan africa is largely , because there are 22 million people living with hiv , which are more valuable to the 30 million people who are infected in the world .
governments have to be able to create effective health systems for ethical aspects in clinical trials that are approved in the different developing world , and the world &apos;s population is being engineered by government and the most effective of the study .
the fundamental problems that we &apos;re faced with are a very high consumption of consumption and too many people .
so they &apos;re all going to fulfill the criteria that people don &apos;t usually deserve .
so you see this power that goes north -- the most powerful in this case -- the back to the galapagos , and this is the kind of light that comes up with the galapagos , the water that comes up to the galapagos .
we also know that not only are the only people &apos;s suffering , but the same penguins and other people .
now i want to show you that penguins are going to be pulled in .
turbo got on , with his sabbath to pat the door , and we let him go in and he comes in here .
and then there &apos;s another one that comes out of comfortable .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we haven &apos;t solved : our fundamental political geography .
the two parts of them are quite a long frontier .
again , like the state of mongolia , china is not an african , it &apos;s a little bit of it .
china is reducing its own , and china is going to be a more threatening , and they can be cheaper to sell their lives and they &apos;re dependent on china to china .
what i want to do here is i want to call it a little bit of a sudden day .
these two arrows form a bow , a bow of the metal , and other infrastructure that connects the west bank with gaza and the west floor .
a lot of them .
so what &apos;s next ? how does the future of european union look ?
53 countries and far the most knowledgeable lines on the map of the map .
this dream is its time time .
it &apos;s bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like this .
okay .
and the hormone emitted that growth is expanding .
so how can a hormone end of aging is falling down the speed of aging ?
we think insulin and igf-1 are hormones that are active in particular , which are active in the very same way -- in good times -- when food is available to the courage , and not much stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details about how it works , but we know that foxo genes have an impact on the lifespan of people .
basically , you could change the genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process i &apos;ve talked about , which is going on in the worm very quickly , has a different normal computer , like a bird , so that the bird can live much longer .
you will never see such a ad , because nike wants to buy your shoes .
they all show heroes that were the most prolific .
it &apos;s like trying to run against a solar system .
this view is that a lot of the most powerful things that are capable of changing the chemistry of the brain , as if it &apos;s actually the brain of the container , is when the brain is in the box of a chemical soup .
and my favorite colleague seymour seymour believes that .
and by the time we found that a mutant , much longer needed to get to the top of the road , and when we were putting the genes , the genes were played in this mutation , we could discover a key one .
this question is , you &apos;ve been asking for a long time in humans , but in flies , we can actually test it .
so , mosquitoes find us in the dark by making us feel more like the point . they smell us .
just to see it , this is the cheese .
people even told me that they &apos;d like to be bitten by mosquitos .
in the process of diving .
and every time i was paying attention to the eyes of the eyes , prisoner was holding out behind me .
and as a result , fat is one of the best sources for adults stem cells .
as we speak , about uva clinical trials to study stem cells for the use of stem cells .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angels in the world , not just in our country : venezuela . in our entire world .
so what happens when it &apos;s not happening ?
but here you see what &apos;s really going on .
i can &apos;t tell you anything about it because i stopped on the headline .
so , euvin allende : what you don &apos;t know about marriage
but how ?
it &apos;s even better . it seems that we can make this receiver , with the help of the material , that in the dna , it &apos;s encoded in dna .
the animal jumps , it spreads its wings , it activates these , but it can &apos;t really take it , but it can &apos;t really break the fly between two glass .
for a intelligent creature like our fly , this rule is not made in stone , but it &apos;s changing as the animal learns by experience .
and by many of these experiments , we were able to pinpoint identity of the critic until 12 cells .
there &apos;s a couple of ideas in the field of science and the artificial intelligence , as you could do , but we still haven &apos;t solved one example of how intelligent behavior is about the physical interaction of the physical interaction .
here &apos;s emmanuel , or actually a computer designer of emmanuel .
ed : all right . tb : okay . a little bit of the way inside , a little bit more to the middle .
in fact , i know that hospitals can be a very dangerous place for young people .
here &apos;s a picture of my favorite from legacy .
one of the things i &apos;m telling you is that this kind of care care that includes everything from their goals to their genes , will change the climate change that we &apos;re going to see in health care .
they don &apos;t stick like a velcro nor a velcro or glue .
here we have the robot .
marc ebert built the most delicious thing .
what would happen if you climb up on the bottom of the paper , and you would come to a plastic sheet or we would shake the sheet ? &quot;
and so , we did it . and he does this .
of course completely different than you would see that in a corporate scanner .
we &apos;re going to look at the rising sea level .
and i would say , the people in the ocean are going to work and think about the goals , we &apos;re going to be much lower .
this is the ship that i was in antarctica for the last three months .
if this ice melts up the sea level , the sea level is going to be six meters .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news for the corals are the the galapagos .
you &apos;re going to have the water supply .
but then at the end of the end , you see the most important thing in black .
we have very interesting possibilities in the atmosphere of millions of years , and we &apos;ve always done this with the only time of the world , but in this case , we &apos;re going to go back 20 million years .
and this is the task that einstein asked : find out how gravity works .
einstein already had room and time , and biases and curves to describe gravity .
but deep in the structure of space , the idea of the idea could be more dimensions than we see there .
and as the strings of a cello different , the same way to be able to mix up the threads in different patterns .
not yet .
is this just an interesting mathematical construction system that may be able to explain some of the things that are in the world , or can we actually demonstrate these extra dimensions ?
so we have two plates here with colorful dots .
now , can you see the predator that &apos;s going to be doing it ?
and what sensory information is true is all about information .
and we look at about 30 seconds of what &apos;s quite a hammer in a 18 minutes .
why ? because if the dark in this shadow actually would be in the shadows and reflect the same amount of light on their eye , like the dark outside the shadow , they would have to reflect more -- just after laws of physics .
how do you know ?
and she comes in the hive , finds a blank ball of hands and hands -- and that &apos;s honey .
he finds him . insane , right ?
vote ? yes ?
there &apos;s no right , or wrong here .
in 2010 , in new york , not so much .
we &apos;re also a species of storytellers .
now some things : understanding of security , the risks , the dangers , how they work .
but in a modern and complex world , they need models to understand the many risks that we &apos;re confronted with .
think about cancer , avian flu , swine flu , sars .
there was no new insight , but less fear .
and there &apos;s another cognitive bias : i call it a little bit of the time to accept data that &apos;s going to be told to be the process of sharing our dna data and to disagree with our favorite data .
i trust another group , whether my airplane was safe to fly with it .
this is the people .
and he was found up here in the near school .
they had good shots with their teachers , students .
let me ask you some questions about whether this is a good choice . &quot;
i took any one to get it to someone , or to save it , or save me as a volunteer hand , but i found that nobody did anything .
we opened the first section of 2009 .
robert paravicini : building a park in the sky
and groups were very often called terrorists , &quot; terrorists . &quot;
you need a more powerful process that &apos;s going to be able to deal with the core of these very complicated society with its problems .
it &apos;s about that we probably have to be in the history of the arab world , a revolution , from the ground , a more powerful .
the paradox is that the last decade was so promising , and it &apos;s a main reason .
at once , the ngos were not calling their slogans only on the streets -- they took them into the negotiations of the world , part because they bind the victims of these guns .
thank you very much for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think that &quot; the &quot; s &quot; is something good .
so this was completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little bit crazy to work on a new computer .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this strange rich man in the movie ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the last day , the sun comes out , the correlations come , they come directly to the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i &apos;m going to give you a little nervous here , because i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit radical things about how to think differently about cancer , a crowd of people , in fact , a lot of people , and i think , have a
the part of the genome we can read is the list of ingredients .
it turns out that a huge amount of information in genetics , by simply comparing genetic resemblance .
and i like , &quot; okay . at least this guy is good . &quot;
so we basically measure every single type of dna as a own .
if you have malaria , we give you a little bit of time , or some of the things that you do .
where really really get to the process that &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s the level of the brain &apos;s activity on the level of the &quot; why does the body not heal itself ? &quot;
danny hillis : cancer by proteomics
they all are members in tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to give up these people .
because at stage three , most of us are .
this is their lobby .
there was no plan . never before , anybody tried something like this .
in fact , martin luther king was a number three .
so i &apos;m sitting here in this chair , and i don &apos;t do anything . &quot;
and suddenly they got out of the street and tried to figure out : &quot; how do we ask the population of sub-saharan africa ? &quot;
automatically , we &apos;re going to get the little bits of plastic up .
and this one , or the other , or the ethos that were designed to make a lot of action , to keep the taxes for the ground , to the ground that they were not considered as a permanent building .
they &apos;re making the stability and security that can offer the lap of a uncle , comparing them with the bollywood construction building in high high school .
but from my perspective , compassion has a problem .
and it &apos;s the most powerful form of the brain &apos;s pleasure .
i can &apos;t really explain them , and it doesn &apos;t .
stories like this , signs like this , are practical aid in a world that &apos;s going to be able to get to the fact that the willpower is going to be , the captchas of suffering , that otherwise could be remembered .
gandhi was also a really profound man .
and the first day , our primary students were going to go to our head and taught us our motto that we had now to take every day for the rest of the summer .
this is one of two or three of your known ones .
here are some examples .
it turns out that we can &apos;t be part of a group without being a immune device .
so that &apos;s the world that we live in today .
and so i &apos;m trying to learn from my grandfather &apos;s example of my own way .
okay , number two : go into the wild .
and imagine , you know , they &apos;re a internal picture : i was born in a very small village in mexico , in unfortunately , very , very , very , very exciting circumstances , and my parents had no higher education .
and so we think that through all the changes that are happening , we &apos;re going to be able to face incredible opportunities today .
it &apos;s an initiative that is based on simple , no budget , and the solutions that are widely done .
we &apos;ve now sent 30 different technologists in 18 different countries , and we &apos;ve been able to connect millions of people in the effort to learn what this particular segment needs and demands .
and my father came to me and i said , &quot; you know , i remember that every generation must make it better than the previous one .
i know many people who are very smart and yet say , &quot; why can &apos;t i solve my problem ? &quot;
i started with them with another family .
don &apos;t you think we have the responsibility to take the environment seriously ? &quot;
i still drive the same four years old , and i still go .
but that &apos;s not a good life .
that &apos;s what he praying .
whether you believe or not , it doesn &apos;t make any difference for me now .
so he said , &quot; what do you think in your hand ? &quot;
what &apos;s that in your hand ? &quot; i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball , and this basketball represents their identity , which they are .
when my kids were smaller , i was always in her room , sat on her room , sat on her bed , and looked at my children sleeping .
it &apos;s less than i had -- i was on three to 10 million -- but yet it &apos;s a very significant number .
in a village , we have 100 laptops , and every one with a different collection of 100 books , so that the village has 10,000 books .
right , the famous chinese characters for the training of the world .
they answer the question : how does it feel like you &apos;re going to be ashamed ?
we really learn these bad lesson really well .
think about how it &apos;s , in the right way , to feel in the right .
and unlike all other animals , we &apos;re obsessed with trying to figure out .
and i have to tell you that i thought i write this incredibly nerdy book about a subject that all of you hate to hate a audience that would never be .
of course , of course , it &apos;s not just the most inclusive wheat of wheat , but mountains of grains .
1986 , she came from vietnam to america .
the answer to this was , &quot; this is even worse . &quot;
our favorite of the average went on to a third of the average in our industry , and in the five years of the dotcom horse , our primary school system has tripled .
and bhutan , for the , is the youngest democracy of the world , only two years old .
it &apos;s actually that we &apos;re in the west , in the west , to be a good job of happiness , when happiness is something that we have to capture , a thing , or maybe several things that we need to get .
and we ask 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s the simplicity .
what we really need to learn as leaders is that we can impact the production of production by creating the right conditions so that our employees can live their calling .
bl : okay . one , two , three .
underneath deck , you tell you the ear , you move your head , but the eyes move in the way , and you say , &quot; i &apos;m silent . &quot;
amy , you come up to the top ?
the method : what did you do ? the result : what have you seen ?
i just read one .
real scientific education should give people a voice and they give them to express these things , so amy , so amy should have the last word in this short story .
poor people don &apos;t have this opportunity .
we were thrown back in the &apos; 70s .
and to get there , we have to realize that the principle of a design of the brain doesn &apos;t only hurt the species that we &apos;ve talked about , but our society also pushed .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure someone &apos;s already asked , &quot; yes , great stuff up there -- but how do i get up there ?
i was a professor at the university of davis , and i got a lot of attention to this , and that allowed me to fund the launch of the program .
we have eight motors in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart , they fall down and they end up here .
i mean , people ask if cell phones are safe .
you have a coil .
because , remember the original idea of dr. strangelove , the most important cell phone of his wife .
and for those who can &apos;t read it : &quot; it seems like it &apos;s actually a kind of wireless technology . &quot;
green or natural , or natural , which is not going to be a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about existing toxins in our bodies .
first , a computer , folded with the computer , which is &quot; the &quot; death of death . &quot;
i was just later learned who he was really .
i &apos;m looking for a cure .
i say , &quot; hold him alive when you can . &quot;
even with this , with this kind of thing , we have the hope of paper in our hands , and we &apos;ve always been redefining hope again .
it &apos;s a feature .
suddenly he knows that he had been defeated .
to give you this , we have to put them back on the driver &apos;s side .
we &apos;re going to do the area , we put it , we put people in , we put people in , we put the buildings from the inside , the design of the world , and we helped the first time , looking at the first time , looking
if i do this , i don &apos;t get the original details . in the opposite , i could write history here .
you &apos;re being withheld by the public opinion .
that &apos;s not very good .
and what &apos;s a democracy that &apos;s going to be ?
here &apos;s the question : what country cut better , china or india ?
because the indian man has a advantage of two years of the indian life in the indian woman .
what political change is , they &apos;ve introduced them to be introduced .
china , i think , has always been some of the most amazing , basic foundations -- especially in terms of social capital , public health , a sense for equality , which is not there in india .
it was a place where people with the operators and with various kinds of plastic systems and the other people &apos;s dna and they were going to be a lot of time .
and now they have the problem that they &apos;ve spent all the money to do the money with this advanced electronics in these countries and now all is useless .
a little chaotic environment , where many ideas were made , where people were more , interesting , interesting , more interesting , more interesting , and people of different different locations .
about a decade ago , a wonderful computer scientist , and he was a wonderful book named howard named darwin &apos;s notebook , and read darwin &apos;s notebook from this period .
they &apos;re going to be able to get their colleagues , but everyone said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think it was to do it .
is that the other thing ?
in the 1970s , the one percent of the national income was in the united states .
many of these political factors can be very closely summarized in the category , and the political effects , political twists , which help a group of good , but actually nothing good for the rest of us .
as you can see , as globalization and technological revolution can be able to create this global fund of money , it &apos;s much harder to do that .
so they invest unprecedented amounts of time and tools to train their children .
we created the modern world technology .
this is his little hand .
one of them is going to be all of us .
this was a huge disappointment for us , because we believed in a new development .
i even believe that places like oregon , where you can take care of the place and can eat a toxic dose , only half a percent people have ever done .
so long talk , long , they came to canada .
but i also heard about cancer as the most popular disease of our time , so how do the good and bad things together ?
some articles even go to say that muscle muscle is resistant to cancer , and beyond , not only against cancer , but it &apos;s about not just the cancer of skeletal muscle .
16 percent ! that there were these kinds of tumors in skeletal muscle , but only 16 percent of the actual metastases -- which is the most powerful , that skeletal muscle may be able to control the tumors that are going to be able to take the tumors to
this is a very long idea , but i really think that &apos;s possible .
and then i left my translator .
she was the girl who was in the breaks in the breaks for her team .
and at the same time , i wrote a letter on my best friends in atlanta , georgia , who had a son for 11 .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot; i asked the translator .
so the two came to lunch , and we got thrown out of the restaurant .
he had children from all korea , and he found families for them .
they have a lot of time on the dictionary .
so i open this window , look out , and see how flames from the hotel of the hotels are shooting in the height of the hotels . the hotel burns .
so we ran into the bath , took up and kept them out of our faces and the children .
until the adoption is . a year ! what &apos;s so much required for ?
this is their favorite .
this is sydney , which is three years old .
but there was no evidence .
there &apos;s little planets , there are bigger planets , there are big planets , okay .
but there &apos;s still a lot more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon , or is it something that depends on each planet ?
and this deeper , more important thing , is that the science is that science is the way we know it to define .
okay , let &apos;s say this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , all right , from here .
thank you very much .
see : while uganda falls down and zimbabwe falls down , russia goes to one percent .
they find the highest hiv in the world in africa , and yet they find in senegal , and there &apos;s the same rate as in the united states .
look at kenya here .
it might be that it &apos;s something else , and it &apos;s more likely to notice .
we know that about 80,000 billion people have ever lived .
that wasn &apos;t just an economic story .
and the result is even a greater divergence in a shorter period than it was in germany .
it &apos;s just with institutions .
they have to give me to eat . &quot;
he was wrong .
now , i want to end with three questions of the future billion , briefly before 2016 , when the united states is going to lose their place as a number one economy .
no , we &apos;re going to be able to stick in a rut , regardless of the huge , major , which we &apos;ve collected , regardless of the point that we &apos;ve lost our work , and other parts of our historical world .
niall , thank you .
there are many kinds of spider silk .
spider silk is almost completely composed of protein .
the fibers that can make a single spider , are already quite diverse .
also , a lot of the potential is a big potential because of their ability to do it .
so what i want to do is not really want the mermaid , so lovely you may be , but on the photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there are more pictures . there are more photographers .
this sounds alien in our ears , but what happens after that is that 80 percent of the contributors have contributed much to the people .
the first thing that happens when you &apos;re a problem is that the first goal of institution is the first goal of the institution that is also changing by what the goal is .
the inventor doesn &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states who are trying to figure out whether bloggers are journalists or not .
it was built by making their own , the use of many of these tools , analyzed the world &apos;s intelligence agencies , and no doubt the intelligence agencies in the world today .
you have a little bit of the time , which is probably the healthiest part of bread or the fibers , because it &apos;s just full of fibers , because it &apos;s made of fibers .
everything is on his place . first level .
we call it &quot; the &quot; s &quot; .
but let &apos;s look at the different steps , under the point of connections , to a deeper level -- my search is just about the answer to the question , &quot; what is so special about bread ? &quot;
this is transforming , two different things .
and if they &apos;re shaped , they go back to prove to be able to be alive and develop character .
if you do this bread , you can use any kind of spent from any beer .
it will be a kind of a design model as we &apos;re working through this talk .
it takes very , very long , these scores , and i work at a piece of time , and i &apos;m working on a piece that &apos;s 180 pages long , and that &apos;s a big part of my life and i &apos;m the hair .
it &apos;s taken by brian chaplin &apos;s , who is an extraordinary artist .
you have a little taste of the piece .
what we did -- betty wooden , one of my students , and i -- we gave the babies two dishes with food : a bowl with a wire with the broccoli broccoli , and a bowl with a laser laser .
i mean , last , if we look at babies , they seem pretty useless .
and our babies and children are much longer dependent on us than the babies each species .
the key thing is to change the hypothesis .
now there are two things that really interesting are interesting .
boy : that &apos;s why .
our consciousness is going to be extremely bright and vivid , and everything else is going to be dark .
&quot; babies and small children are like the research and the human species , &quot; says the psychologist , is , reveals , alison gopnik . their research studies how babies play in games , and make decisions .
if i could borrow you for a little demonstration of a little demonstration , to show the difference -- because it &apos;s actually quite obvious .
then you repeat this process , and again , again , until something comes out of this -- in this case , the character is like i go straight .
what we really wanted was the whole human body .
you can &apos;t do that .
here &apos;s a couple of simple scenes , like he got .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we &apos;ve done it yet .
some of the studios are already using our software to do exactly the same thing , and we &apos;ll have a few of our most important things to see in a few major types of energy .
we thought he was just going to hold the balance .
here you learn to go to the street -- like most of you hopefully know .
but i have to say , i &apos;ll never forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i believe that art and creativity are essential to creating empathy .
if you ever have the lonely , you &apos;re sending a new york times , then you get hundreds of emails . most of what i &apos;m going to do today is covered by frustration .
but some stories are just classic , and yet it &apos;s so understandable .
it &apos;s falcons . nobody ever bought it .
there &apos;s a border that we don &apos;t want to cross . so what is the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want to make a new , empty document in word -- that might be .
but i think there are two microsoft &apos;s favorites .
the other products were supported by microsoft with an open standard , rather than apple &apos;s standard standard .
and then , if you put me a little bit of a sudden , you know , when someone writes a little bit of a day -- i say , &quot; kiss me . &quot;
but when i looked at the most sophisticated technologies , nanotechnology , and other people , and other people in the come of digital technologies , i was very worried about the most important thing about the design system .
and to limit the danger of these new things , we ultimately have to limit the ability to be able to have the individuals that are basically going to make them access to the access to the access .
i think the challenge that we &apos;re facing -- i &apos;m very sure that this is going to happen -- the challenge is : will we develop these online systems with the background that will make us use from this device that will make us use from this device ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , for example , you have all kinds of incredible properties , you &apos;re all all possible .
and to give you a sense of the last of the little , of the small , of the small , he was in a 400 million dollars , so that &apos;s really remarkable for us .
and if you use the concept of consumer companies , you can do a much more powerful entity -- the foundations of the market -- to provide feedback .
12 years ago , in the 1930s , i started to be fascinated with the fact that i was going to do my research in this direction .
so beautiful and grim things .
there &apos;s ice under the surface .
so they &apos;re a little bit of a life form .
it &apos;s actually so much energy for biology in this cave that there are actually a big number of dna types .
we can see them .
we realized a few years ago that caves have been a lot of properties that were used by people and other organisms earlier .
whenever you &apos;re a goal , you have to set up a certain way to get a little bit of a load of your own way .
and so it &apos;s also in archimedes , the big greek mathematician .
geopolitics was made over and it was under extreme steel .
so , before we could start to digitize the world &apos;s energy , we had to take the book apart .
and this is what it looks like .
but by flying the electrons around with light speed , they give up x-rays .
this was a bad idea , because philip von siegel had a son named alexander who &apos;s the great , and they lost the battle of the internet .
because right now , institutions are peeling with the data of the information and so forth .
the original owners of the bottle was one of the most enthusiastic of the 18th century .
i asked myself , 160 dollars for what ?
she has four balconies .
a key pattern is that many of these things come from japan -- they &apos;ll notice it .
i mean , a little bit of a sudden , a toilet toilet .
there was an object that i couldn &apos;t get in the finger , and that was the sixth cheval blanc .
and i can &apos;t -- call my taste the one of the a little -- so it &apos;s not necessarily important that i wasn &apos;t impressed , but i wasn &apos;t the only one there with this reaction .
at the beginning of this year , a virtual asteroid was sold for 350,000 real dollars .
the really interesting thing about virtuality , is that you can measure them .
now , i could develop a game called the name of the name by just getting a million pies , or a thousand pies .
if it &apos;s real boxes , we can &apos;t do much , but in a game we say , &quot; ok . &quot;
this is absolutely critical and virtuality in it .
and i want to tell you a quick story in 1999 -- there was a video game called the &quot; video game . &quot;
it &apos;s about how individual engagement can be transformed by the psychological and neurological insights that we get when we &apos;re watching people playing .
it &apos;s a kind of a conceptual texture called the &quot; an interspecies idol . &quot;
i &apos;m a ellen , and i &apos;m totally obsessed with diet .
there &apos;s definitely hunger in america , 49 million people , and almost more , very much of all children .
and their farms are also big .
it &apos;s the 30 anniversary of the grain of crop grain and the big bang , from chicken mcnuggets , the most cosmopolitan of the chicken , the most cosmopolitan , the u.s. and the change of the way we &apos;re farming international .
this is a very , very popular thing i received two years ago , which was one of the greatest projects i was and my company ever involved .
but i &apos;m going to just just go to the process of the process , to three very basic statements .
if we &apos;re so good , in which we do , we shouldn &apos;t be able to create a architectural manifestation that &apos;s just very strict through the most sophisticated and more nuanced of the earth &apos;s hands ?
the architectural agreement was , i said , simple .
and this is the actual bonus of the effort .
the second technology we &apos;ve used , because we use things that you know from the most of a opera .
here you see the most sophisticated configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk about how to collect stories , to be a little bit more like a census .
one of these projects is about a year old .
these are the images that are automatically created .
as long as i was awake , i had the camera around the neck .
you can see a timeline that shows you the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s a little bit more populous . well , on .
a video dropout of dna deprivation .
an artist , a farmer , the farmer .
what if you just found the truth of what would you do , what would you do the next 35 years of life ?
&quot; money , &quot; and a business open , was the indian state of the world .
and during anesthesia , he told them that he wanted to be in the process of being a little more threatening , and he gave me a kind of a little more likely to die .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , writing has really benefits .
with the hand , it &apos;s almost impossible , except in the way that it &apos;s in the process of communication , and then communication is limited .
very funny people , if lol means that .
you don &apos;t do that in a balanced way .
if someone was seen by 1973 in a black board of 1993 , the most important thing was a little different since the time of &quot; love &quot; but he had understood what was there .
i &apos;m about the most popular , i wanted to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you can look at my work next week , and also in the most cosmopolitan of the city in the street , in the middle of the street .
afghanistan is not a existential threat for global security .
and the same thing is true of the troops .
instead , there was a very strict of the optimism optimism .
diplomats dig out in a hospital .
and finally , we have to understand that the secret of what we did in bosnia and kosovo , the secret of our success was to be a huge part of our success in our humility -- in the careful , very careful way of doing our job .
rory , she said to libya .
so here you see two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger , to be fundamentally fundamental to you , as it looks .
there &apos;s also a little bit of time that &apos;s going to be kidnapped , but if you &apos;re going to get these online cells , that &apos;s used for another kind of carbon change .
the key thing . this is a hard problem for reasons that i &apos;m not going to be able to get away .
there &apos;s another one , very interesting connection , and this is that what you want to do is to keep more valuable information on a general basis of a pretty bad model .
so , i think it has the minimal food that we can probably achieve to make things .
and we decided we should not think about it as much as the cost , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book called &quot; what &apos;s the most popular thing to do in kansas ? &quot;
so we have to ask why .
but nevertheless , you don &apos;t interact with a lot of people who aren &apos;t like that .
so we can think of things like the most powerful .
i &apos;m kidding , but only half , if i say that in the hospital , nobody will believe if you &apos;re going to miss with a missing limb without the previous person , mri and the plastic of the brain .
then bell turns to his students .
within a few years in the late 19th century , early 20th century , the doctor was beginning to try and make a diagnosis , the most educated .
between the patient , and the doctors in terms of the best medical care , there is a real contradiction .
another experience i did in texas before i went to stanford , was influenced .
the bad news : the exact cause of the cause we don &apos;t . look at it ? you can do it , you can do that . &quot;
i remember so many huge , more powerful , chasing eyes that were going to me in this ritual .
some of us call us a more powerful term .
in this case , we &apos;ve been investigating .
for you back there , here &apos;s a miracle , &quot; then a miracle happened .
and there was no way to get out of it .
religious folk .
it &apos;s harder to move harder to the dead to answer .
my friend simon singh , a computer scientist , is doing a ph.d. , &quot; the big bang &quot; and &quot; etc . &quot;
and now they open their eyes .
you can completely open it , and he &apos;s a little bit of a sudden .
but it &apos;s been taught to be excited about that that these guys , at least most , knowledge , what they do for a living .
everybody was holding this for impossible .
you can create a lot of change . you can build roads .
and that &apos;s something that people want to do .
you don &apos;t need everyone .
hugo &apos;s juggler has invented the most delicious and middle class in venezuela , and he just led her .
and so it goes on .
they connect people .
the reason ? the modern medicine today is using a 60 years old method .
there &apos;s still a catch .
it makes him more quickly , over 26 times cheaper , over 400 times more than our current health system for pancreatic cancer .
but my experience with islamic world is very different .
so , for example , there are the following .
and why does sex lead to babies , and why are babies in relationships in their relationships ?
because it &apos;s the secret of the desire .
especially , in this description of the other or my self -- that &apos;s the same thing -- especially interesting that there &apos;s no more painful in the desire .
this is your favorite , and you &apos;re betting , that &apos;s biology , natural instinct .
and then it starts to desire . this is what curiosity needs , the magic .
you know that there &apos;s an erotic space that is heard every one alone .
other places in the country had similar spaces .
in a corporate scanner , this kind of music is perfect .
ok .
that &apos;s usually played in smaller rooms .
so early school , some of the people have a lot of time .
so i asked myself , ok , is this a model for design , that adaptation that we practice ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned to me and he said , &quot; that &apos;s where it stands .
how do we solve the following three problems that i want to bring to language ?
albert einstein -- i &apos;m just confronted with someone when i was in princeton , and i met mr. einstein .
what &apos;s going on in life ? why am i here ?
i never read a speech or a lecture or a lecture .
and it was about 300 people there .
he talked about his personal experience .
a french historian , two centuries later , said , &quot; rarely have a more powerful mind with the authority of jesus &apos;s authority . &quot;
or he was what he proposed .
i &apos;m not going to go beyond the murdered and the execution .
but for that , you have to sit for about 10 minutes and a woman in the arm that &apos;s not there .
i was never in .
harvest the
and with tears in the eyes , i said , &quot; no . &quot;
in 2010 , a young woman stands in front of president m. and says , how they and their siblings live together , their parents died in war .
we go in rural areas and everything we do in this room , we create a space .
i failed .
i want to look back about 20 years from now and see that there &apos;s a little girl , a computer scientist , a nigerian , nigerian girl on this stage .
lg : like , you know .
licklider was able to understand computers can do the necessary things to make insights and decisions .
every interaction is recorded by more sensors : your phone , your card card , your computer , your computer , and it &apos;s a lot of data and we get the opportunity to understand our existence more closely .
these records were human health records .
by a greater process , what else is a task for 40 people was about three months of a simple task for three months , and that &apos;s a simple task for three people .
we should stop looking outside .
dinner with my wife and the children to go home .
because people say , &quot; shit man , i don &apos;t have a time to get into it .
she was a much larger dog than i thought .
this impact affects all of us .
the boom &apos;s boom is to our problems .
think of the piano , you know , the math .
in katrina , we have more in katrina .
and they all have done that , and if they don &apos;t , they have to be done .
help me make green to the new black . help me make sustainability sexy .
so i thought that would be a chance to use scratch to make a interactive map for my mother .
but i &apos;m skeptical of what this kind of thing is about .
in this case , you take a laser tag , put it on a pile and the stack of the pile of the brain determine the behavior of the different characters in a game or a story , in that case , the great fish .
if you learn to code , you can code to learn .
if children like lula created these projects , they learn important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s just the beginning .
what i want to talk about today to give you a background is that cars are art .
i want to talk about it .
and i think that this thought that great cars have a soul , very useful , and they all know that . they see a car with the first sight . they know how strong it is .
this is one of my favorite , which is really our relationship to cars .
right ? and they decided that it would be cheaper , instead of a studio and six or seven , elizabeth , magnificent house in malibu .
there was a lot of dialogue .
i think we felt very close to this day , and we were left with threads , and we were getting the concept for the real creature of true engineering and creativity .
we didn &apos;t bring him to boston .
i just have a little lab .
now we &apos;ve now been going to go to clinical trials in four main projects in this disease .
we don &apos;t have a team of the design and the internet companies that can tell us that drugs on the market .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
what you need to remember is that we have to do with a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , with the 100 billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t explain was why the entropy was ever low .
unlike the low entropy of the early universe , even though we don &apos;t know the answer , we have a good theory , which can explain that , if this theory is true , and that the theory of the dark energy .
and so , although the universe becomes forever , and ordinary matter and radiation will be moving apart , and you can still give a certain level of radiation , some of the thermal fluctuations , even in empty space .
but we also give it big fluctuations .
it stops .
it &apos;s a decent fact of the universe that you &apos;re supposed to accept and not question .
i had never used a computer yet .
it was a future i couldn &apos;t accept .
now , i want to do something out there , like me , say to africans and the poor , and the poor who are fighting with their dreams .
no matter what movement i did in my real world was just using with my little device in the digital world , eight years ago , in 2000 .
i took this very , very , i took my bike bike , and i put it a little bit of a little bit of a sudden that the hull of the printer was fine .
the camera doesn &apos;t really understand my movements , but it &apos;s also capable of understanding what things i hold in my hand .
and why just do it ? we can just play with documents .
all the work you &apos;ve seen is about my learning in india .
this is juan carlos , king of spain .
this is the third largest park in rio , june this year .
again , you don &apos;t have to dig deep under the earth to build a station .
i &apos;ll give you a quick example here .
almost every year we have these awful folk projects .
we &apos;re under the average in the city of the city .
a city of the future is a city that nobody is cutting out of this great community , which cities are .
the best answer is to try to reconstruct a darwin &apos;s success scientist , to be a darwinian state of our artistic and aesthetic preferences .
so the trick of evolution is to make it beautiful , so you get a kind of gravitational pulse to make it feel like you &apos;re just going to look at it .
and some of them are in any case to be big to use the battles .
our strong response to images , to the expression of feelings in art , to beauty , is going to be the beauty of music at the night sky , and our offspring are , as long as human race exists .
well , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see here how the computer sees the environment , and there you can &apos;t see the flash , we &apos;re actually going to have the driver , we actually have the driver with red leds , so it can actually see what &apos;s happening .
let &apos;s see if mark can avoid you .
or for blind people in the household , in the education , in education and office .
a subtle network of creativity had begun . the most powerful , that normal people don &apos;t hear voices and i heard them , but i thought that something was not true to me .
my mental health was a catalyst for a catalyst , hate hot and more of the physical and sexual security , and i was told by my psychiatrist , &quot; eleanor , with cancer , is better than schizophrenia . &quot;
to be a reductionist , if social change begins , it can &apos;t be interviewed anymore .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing right now .
so what i &apos;m suggesting is that there &apos;s where we should look for life , more than mars , even though mars is a very much more sophisticated and interesting place .
and the usual astronomers were full of contempt .
because it &apos;s the kind of life that can live out there , it has a tremendous amount of benefits compared to life on a planet .
there was another object that was going to get this high , and the high , and naked -- pretty scary stuff for a little kid .
the first projects were modest , but they would take technology and they might turn them into things that people would use on a new way and find a new functionality .
the other thing that &apos;s the most important thing is that we decided that we decided to all the technical gadgets , all the whole technology , and tried to make it so beautiful as possible .
so we called it y water . so this is another example where everything is going on in a room : three-dimensional design , the ideas that are developing the brand , it &apos;s all intimately interconnected .
this is my favorite anthony anthony , in switzerland , he had the laptop for a afternoon , i had to put it back with him . that was hard .
yves behar : the design of objects that tell stories
thank you .
my aunt , an incredibly energetic and brilliant woman , became early widow .
she was the most popular for women &apos;s women who i &apos;ve ever heard .
look at these young girls who come back to school after acid in their faces , &quot; atheist in their faces . &quot;
the world , the layma gave up the , was a world in war .
then the situation becomes tense .
you have to negotiate .
it &apos;s the people from my generation , which are growing up in a world where everything is in the world , and in some of our best conversations , have been on a screen .
ultimately , it could mean that you could print your own medicine .
and if it smells why it &apos;s even interesting , then you have to look at the rest of saudi arabia , because it &apos;s a country that &apos;s consistent between the male males .
maybe some things are bad traditions and they need changes .
let me give you an example : turkey , where i from , which is a very , very basic republic , we had a little bit of the way that i &apos;m going to call the college , which should protect the universities against the college students .
if i would be the only person who thinks that would have been a problem .
in the 19th century , when muslims saw europe as an example , they were independent , they were independent .
so the e.u. &apos;s process was the way turkey &apos;s efforts to join the e.u. , in turkey , in turkey , from the iraqi muslim muslim , while some of the countries were against the iraqi nations .
there &apos;s a very big nose that &apos;s not going to seem to be able to get into something that &apos;s connected to anything .
if scientists today , a century , they want to see neurons , and then they &apos;ll make them visible from the inside , instead of making them to darkness .
carl strudwick : glimpses of the inside of our brain
but this trend is less clearly .
but for many parts of africa , it was a colleague of mine , &quot; the builder at the tuesday night , &quot; was elected to the right time , so the genocide could start on the front of the street .
and instead of putting this possibility , local leaders , and they have been very fond of leaders , and they have been focused on the second , the events of the world &apos;s second , the events of the design , september 2001 and iraq .
design design requires a strong focus on the most powerful , thinking and adaptable and mutual practice .
the stromatolites are the heroes of my story .
in the shallow seas , life has been very early ; it turned out in more complex shapes .
and the main thing was , the big one was going on .
some of the mammals went back to the water .
every man should have a luxury of a luxury .
but there was nothing for this purpose , so we have married with prostate cancer and then we created our motto , which is , &quot; the face of the man &apos;s health . &quot;
mo benyus from canada , from the united states , and from england , and we said , &quot; hey , there &apos;s nothing for prostate cancer .
and i said , &quot; last year we had the lucky to have 450 statements . &quot;
this kind of conversation , men to engage in every age , is so critical and important , and i think that much more important than the money we collect .
he could see what happened his forest , his environment , because his grandfather took him under his wing as he was just two years old and started teaching him about the forest and the way of teaching his people .
when i thought about it , i wonder what our grandchildren and our excitement would respond if they ask the same question .
we need new models to be a leader and human beings .
it works with people like the piano .
a life for all , through all of the cultural revolution and everything after that , he gathered , so he had about eight million parts in his museum , the contemporary chinese story .
it &apos;s just happening .
&quot; my world &quot; is subjective .
or maybe he was just a nude who sat on a rock and the sky , and the sun and the moon .
and if you lived a remarkably life , you will get into the body , or , like the french , the &quot; the &quot; s &quot; -- the sky of the world &apos;s name .
and so it comes to these great rituals where big amounts of the world &apos;s most powerful and they were in their lives , and they were in 10 days .
do you see what is business because of the other one of the market and behavior of an organization ?
look , this is india today . the most important of reality is based on a tube .
you know , he &apos;s built the biggest school industry , called &quot; big traffic . &quot;
&quot; why i chose this path , why don &apos;t i care about the expertise , just get me , please . &quot;
health care is opening us up to the myth of the new look at the myths of india and the west -- and shows why these are the environmental systems of the design of the world , the most prolific systems of the design of the world , the death
but you know what ? it &apos;s almost 2012 to say , &quot; i &apos;m completely , and i &apos;m absolutely competent , &quot; means to destroy itself with the weakest praise .
you &apos;re interested in what ?
their friends and family will come together , and there &apos;s a tutor on their grave , and there &apos;s a tombstone written on the grave , &quot; here &apos;s a great engineer , who invented velcro . &quot;
they &apos;re happy . this is the conversation , the mothers and fathers want to hear , because their child is good in math and they know what &apos;s next .
that &apos;s because they -- they know what they are .
i don &apos;t have patents and i never get money from a medical school , and i don &apos;t think they &apos;re going to choose me .
so where do you know if your breast is high density ?
ultrasound has more jargon to follow the consequence of other technologies , even though , and it &apos;s not very prevalent .
if you find a tumor , as long as it &apos;s less than a centimeter , the survival of survival is about 90 percent , but it &apos;s a huge deal of increase with increasing power .
the picture of mbi shows this tumor much more clearly , as a second tumor , which is a very strong tumor that &apos;s going to affect the patient &apos;s surgical possibilities .
it costs a radiologists of specific education to distinguish an expert in the face of a normal , a normal body of detail .
some women who get breast cancer die , they die later , and fortunately , most of them survive .
kleiber is up there da da bueno da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da .
we collect these physicists in los angeles to see what they build .
mill .
they slept in this lectures .
this is an amazing vision .
it &apos;s a question of the consequences .
so let &apos;s go to the point .
what did i do ? did i hear my belly ?
this is interesting . this is another way to think .
the sleepy is basically a visualization of a human being where everyone is part of the surface that it &apos;s going to be in the brain .
this is white noise .
and db will probably roll in your direction .
i did just to make money .
thank you .
and he told me a long silence , &quot; i wonder , i wonder if people are not here , the people here don &apos;t find their own in the benches of my own . &quot;
this is the reason i &apos;m with david edward , a scientist at harvard , a object that can absorb the toxic elements with these plants .
no , not potatoes , but tomatoes , herbs and so on .
the tragedy of other people , you can take easier to take than your own and i want to be a mind of the mind .
according to the malcolm gladwell , the most sophisticated thing was the water crack of the tomato soup of tomato sauce .
he was a really interesting sight .
he went back to the second floor and said , &quot; hey guys .
like mcdonald &apos;s .
so let &apos;s think of other people &apos;s favorite , where you can expect a very high risk .
the second reason was that the gang was brilliant in marketing and was the &quot;
economists talk about theory of game theory -- that every game for two people have a more powerful .
so , you know , it &apos;s skydiving with a board on the feet .
so , as high as this is , you know , just as a result , if you &apos;re going to start to practice , if you &apos;re really going to be able to make a lot of your physically and mentally , you &apos;re going to work .
ue : no . it &apos;s just smoke .
occasionally i meet with scientists .
so i had the hope that , by having some natural elements , a little bit of fog , i could make the space light .
raku means it makes a difference if you do something or not .
the big mountains in the distant distance are getting less .
how do we create an idea that is both useless to individuality , and also to redefine the two in two different directions , without the two different directions ?
i talked about new species of the design , one that is attracted to animals rather than defeat them .
but it was an incredible thing that was the material that was recorded .
you take the dead and you get the dead .
at this time he taught the classic college at the university of college in austria .
natalie merchant : singing old poems about life
so , as a dolphin , it &apos;s hardly going to be .
as an adult , when i was about the amazing insights of penny , and chaz , sue , kanzi , and panbanisha , and alex , and alex , who heard , i heard i was excited for that .
rs : ng : like that .
we &apos;re in the national aquarium , we &apos;re engaged for the most amazing software , for research and education .
but we realized pretty quickly that we had built a system that connects people together .
today . this is the first time you talk about this topic .
this is a picture of me and my daughter we hold a israeli flag .
&quot; because it works , make a poster with me . &quot;
they came and they were so many . one day , i remember that cassette fission was talking to a journalist and asked him , &quot; who will see this ? &quot; and he said , &quot; everybody . &quot;
it &apos;s not the most important . it &apos;s not my side .
and sometimes war is a war . but sometimes , with a little bit of effort , we can avoid it .
and what we &apos;re doing with &quot; yes is more &quot; to try to ask that the architectural design system is almost defined by the same thing , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re about to do .
and we saw this guy , the design .
and slowly , you start thinking that sustainable life makes less fun than normal to live .
so , go to the expo , first of all , get a little wheel , and go on to the other , and drive on the other side of the road .
it was interesting because she was in the morning from nine to 11 , and how many billion she was supposed to invest in the rescue of the economy .
this is a video of switzerland , and in switzerland , there &apos;s a national need to have a national need of the u.s.
we often make small films .
what i &apos;d like to talk about is the biggest problems in the world .
but it &apos;s of course a problem when you put people on problems .
so what i &apos;m focused on is to say that we have a very long time , a situation that we &apos;ve had a number of choices .
and then you ask , why economists ?
but it says that what we can do is very little cost to very high cost .
the most sophisticated thing about malaria is a few million infected per year .
what happens here is that we think about our priorities .
it &apos;s a good movie in terms of that i &apos;m going to see him , right , but don &apos;t expect from the other film of the film brad pitt to send the way he &apos;s in tanzania or something like that .
they had all the same material , but they could leave the frame of the discussion , and they made it safe to make their own lists .
it &apos;s a power of wealth and greater freedom to create , &quot; is a lot of time . &quot;
secondly , china has managed to reduce the rise of income emissions , without changing the political framework .
so freedom house found that even though 50 percent of all countries are now democratic , 70 percent of them are being avoided , in terms of that people don &apos;t have a more sophisticated or more or more or more or more or more .
because finally , the question is , the question that we &apos;re asking and seven billion other people on this planet : how can we create wealth ?
the most important thing is not to be in your place .
we &apos;re going to do what really matters .
it was published six months ago , and it &apos;s got incredible attention in germany .
you have to make sure that you have to make a sense of scaling temperature .
i think it &apos;s easy to look at human skin , which is fascinated me .
but i think it could be a fairly bright and sustainable utility to our online resources .
chinese workers are not being rented in factories because of our primary demand for ipods .
just because one person spent their time with a piece of things , which is not that they &apos;re going to be a piece of something .
min &apos;s sister turned to him and said , &quot; some understanding just . you don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
this is the most important thing that min gave me to the way to the train in the train .
the taliban are doing their own schools .
if any child gets caught in the process of breaking these rules , it will be hard to break .
if i look at suicide bombers , i &apos;m younger than i , or in my age , i feel so inspired by their attacks .
and that will be on the line , just there on enceladus , waiting by the bottom of the world , which hopefully is at the very top in the middle future , specifically , to pursue this question .
is this the internet actually a place you can visit ?
and the landscape is changing . three years ago , when i started to engage me with this , there was only one cable along the west coast of the west coast , shown here in this map of steve song as a thin black line .
and that &apos;s not true to me .
this data is sent to layer at layer on the device , starting with the base of the product , and puts it up the material layer , by turning the new carbon lanes into a square layer of the old layer of light .
it was made by egyptian layers of the layers of the layers of things .
an aerial is less likely .
they can just make it right in the place .
this is made the product .
without any doubt i believe that this technology is creating a revolution in production , and the most important thing about it is that we &apos;re going to change them .
he was worried that if he called it at this name , especially outside the public , you might think he would be encouraging bin laden &apos;s perception .
they use his own .
the good news is that it doesn &apos;t have to be like that .
but many of these factors played a role , even more than that , and half of the work is done .
i was with my friend susan kamen who was walking in the mathare valley slums .
she said , &quot; you know , poverty was not the bad thing . it was the humiliation and the embarrassment of all the things . &quot;
do you think i &apos;m going to miss violence or the drugs ? the lack of privacy ?
first , instead of months , the air will be going over and forgotten , the time was very much more sophisticated .
but it &apos;s less likely to say they &apos;re staying .
and during my first year , i kept my company .
it &apos;s actually going to say that more energy needs more energy to make a solar cell , when it &apos;s going to be in all the time of the world .
solar cells are going to collect the light for four and a half .
and they &apos;re also under a great pressure , and they &apos;re dangerous .
this is a very reactive .
it &apos;s just a little cylinder down here , the generator and all the most sophisticated in itself , and this is the hot wave of the hot cylinder , the hot cylinder , the upper cylinder , and it comes out of electricity .
you don &apos;t have to use the hot water , it can also cool .
so here we have a map of the united states .
and we don &apos;t have a precursor to use this energy so fast as we do it right now .
we &apos;re going to go and look at the parts .
it &apos;s a flying lab that we did the measurements in the region of this molecule .
but i still wrote bad poems , and he never got the dog &apos;s head in the air , but he &apos;s gone to cuba .
so , from a variety of things , great things can arise -- -- which i then have a picture of a picture that eventually is going to happen in my work .
i work for the new york and i do a little bit of the time , and then 9 / 11 came , and that was , um , a kind of a , a man &apos;s end of the world like we knew .
then &quot; brightest &quot; clear , is that the tongue with the tongue , but that &apos;s how we understand it . &quot;
&quot; and he decided that his favorite had been extinct . &quot;
this man is angry because somebody everywhere goes on his staircase , and basically -- you know , you know , onion here , you know , a subject to be here -- you know , a theme here .
and it &apos;s also taken with george clooney , so i think it &apos;s not .
td : since my youngest childhood and after , many different obligations were given me to each other , and when i was young , i came to this way that my way was a little bit more , i was going to be more honest .
this is beautiful , but we should remember that a similar process should be done in an internal level .
td : lakshmi has worked incredibly hard , even for my invitation , let alone all the other things you &apos;ve done , so that it &apos;s happening and i &apos;ve been quite resistant to this whole week and i &apos;ve been very nervous during this whole week .
in these two examples , we &apos;ve seen machines that have learned in the simulation , to go and go and have others learn it in the reality .
if i say , &quot; i mean , i &apos;m the advice for the ted team .
but nobody believes it &apos;s actually going to be very effective if there &apos;s a real outbreak .
the biggest part of the world spending in the administration &apos;s administration is actually more connected to anthrax and the threat of biological weapons .
we know that the virus is going to mutate . it &apos;s going to be another virus .
but in the scientific community , there &apos;s a discussion of what percentage of the world &apos;s population is about by empowering people through their own and dispersants and how much about the hands .
some of the poorest countries that have the most experience with h5n1 have a full of drugs that have already been adopted .
and i think even our leaders would say that we have a lot to do .
i &apos;m really excited to answer her questions .
our centers for the federal system have one of them developed from them -- as a rapid test system .
and in the previous days , people were similar bacterial infections , and they didn &apos;t have a problem .
don &apos;t just notice how much fun you have with this , but also how much the work is completely changing , with a city like san francisco .
please put a little bit of a time .
i &apos;m going to talk to a young juggler from a force , and he was making a little , three clubs .
i &apos;ve been playing with my childhood , and i &apos;ve been climbing , and i &apos;m going to climb , so i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m going to be a college specialist .
manhattan don &apos;t go into the infinite .
so i &apos;m not supposed to be here , right ?
i &apos;m staying in the middle .
she was one , i was going to the triumph .
because of the wind leaves and branches , it &apos;s very dark and very quiet .
i and my colleagues of the computer care care care of the dynamics of the world &apos;s dynamics .
we &apos;re advising ourselves with the media , we have a nuclear record ; we have a little bit of a sudden .
and then the students in our dining room came , and they took their own rubber coat with their own beats .
and our new project is that the inmates and we learn to grow the frog , to grow the frog , which is a high from extinction of endangered states in the states and oregon .
he said , &quot; look what they hid before you . &quot;
so we see a rising demand for the color .
they &apos;re not a magician . they &apos;re not our parents .
you have to believe me . trust me . &quot;
and i learned two really important things that day .
the deeper we go underwater , the higher is the pressure .
so i started about 15 years ago .
the air is going to breathe into the air industry , breathing the air from the air industry .
every one of these computers can do the whole system , so if two of them are getting out of it , there are more reserves .
but it looks like this , and this habitat is continuing to go over many miles .
so sharks are not quite dangerous , as most people are .
when we found him , we were not even sure what family he heard , so we called him a new way to the design system , because he looked like he was coming from one of his books .
oxygen oxygen has a deceptive and it was temporarily .
this means that every one of you here knows at least a child at least a child &apos;s suffering .
and his communication and social interaction improved so much that he could visit a normal school and even a more sustainable one .
it &apos;s like life : if you &apos;re only in it , you can &apos;t get out of it .
i know you &apos;ve never heard of him . but you see this day , one day you &apos;ll hear from him , because he &apos;s a fascinating man . &quot;
nk : no , he died 25 years ago .
he had a lot of love , he loved everybody .
we all , from us , are what happens when a soup of hydrogen and helium is so long as long as they &apos;re going to be asking themselves to ask about their origins .
these are the most powerful things that are going to prove that life can exist in many other environments .
so you have to learn the diversity and the incredible scale of life on this planet in the first step to be deeply deeply deeply connected to a living with life elsewhere .
so it &apos;s going to be silicon as aluminum , and we &apos;re going to expand it in a future by expanding it by 350 antennae so that it &apos;s sensitive and around the moore &apos; law .
and then we &apos;d like to make the search of the search of human health systems .
many people say it &apos;s the best place in the world to study the development of climate change .
every cylinder is a very popular time .
while you &apos;re using the ice , warm , you &apos;re a little bit of gloves in a oven , so you can put a new pair of gloves , and you can put your fingers in and you &apos;re stiff .
i believe in this place a little bit of economic dispute .
and our soldiers don &apos;t really talk to us , to push up pipelines in the back of the police station when they actually have the service to get american health companies .
you can keep it further , and the efficiency of the more triple improvements with some of the improvements and the cause of the great majority of the major market causes .
we could build bigger cars , which would be to help be a safety problem , but it would be easy .
but instead , they sell it to china and japan because we have to protect our food systems and the other .
and that &apos;s the way that the first thing that &apos;s going to do is to make the step of mass production of this kind of materials , or in this case , to create the power of carbon processing , as a good consumer , as a good thing
it can &apos;t just act to a giant circuit conspiracy .
there were two types of negative feedback that we &apos;ve received .
we hope that it really goes stable .
oops , i &apos;m wrong .
at the end of the day , he found a giant , a dutch , a dutch van meegeren named the han van meegeren who would give him a wonderful vermeer to take about 10 million dollars .
according to his computer , he looked like he had discovered for the first time , that there was bad in the world . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s coming . what is it ? &quot; is a good answer .
but as attractive you find them , how much they sexually are sexually or romantic , is important depends on what they think they &apos;re looking at .
but each of these three objects has value , which is what it does , because of his story .
but i don &apos;t want a copy , even though i can &apos;t see the difference .
so he brought joshua bell to take his head in a subway station in washington d.c. , to see a corner and see how much money he would take .
the second shock is painful , because you &apos;re used to a little bit of it .
and if you &apos;re going to see the way you can see that maybe there &apos;s a kind of political science that &apos;s going on .
they &apos;re making it a nuclear , professional member of the american health company , which sounds very glamorous and exciting .
and what you find is , of course , people who eat vegetables and oil , they have less control .
the most intriguing thing is one of the most intriguing things in the world of medicine .
it &apos;s a very recent conclusion when you &apos;re a drug in such high doses that it &apos;s going to have more side effects , and that you &apos;re going to look better better .
the great trials are closer to the true answer .
this is a problem that doesn &apos;t give you a solution to that .
and very soon they would have started this coal , 2,000 pounds , 2,000 pounds of wood , the u.s. power , the u.s. power , to china , back to china , back to china and everywhere .
can you imagine how you feel if you were in my place ?
it &apos;s just about oil ; you know that , all knowledge .
there &apos;s this thing that &apos;s the world &apos;s most , and it &apos;s right from the middle of the united states .
and what do you see ? they &apos;re christians .
man , the americans , are somehow like , &quot; ah , &quot; aah .
these christians are the most powerful .
they were denied . this is wrong .
and the soldiers are chinese , and everybody else is chinese .
you can imagine that maybe one of them goes down the morning , and it &apos;s screaming and she said , &quot; honey , i &apos;m back back .
it &apos;s changed .
and all of that has been on the world .
i think thomas jefferson really did it very well in words .
so for the ted community , the audience &apos;s going to explain why they have a bigger budget than comedy , and that &apos;s because it &apos;s a lot of the time that they &apos;re going to be able to translate more and more into other languages and cultures .
but it &apos;s going to happen within this century .
this is not the u.s. government , which is going to be over a million , but gdp per capita per capita -- 200,000 dollars .
and also , as anyone knows -- it &apos;s about energy , not oil .
my choice is the peak of a life commitment to grow up with the gulf of the gulf of the gulf .
a lot of our actions on this planet , which are affecting our living environment , are only by belief and anxiety .
each one has been there for thousands or millions of years .
we have to calm down before we ruin the planet .
e. wilson : saving life on earth
another more important european summit is the famous european summit .
the passenger pigeon is a $ 1.3 base base base base .
the reversal of the agricultural land falls into this category .
real falcon from lightly chicken fires .
and it &apos;s a program that &apos;s going to be a very brilliant program .
this is an emotional topic . some people stand up .
my grandmother was a tedster .
i also made my own comic comic , which was another way to tell stories , through words and pictures .
and we sat at a moment , in silence and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really talented . &quot;
use your own style . draw , don &apos;t check it .
&quot; rather jarrett , i &apos;ve got your favorite .
i &apos;m also going to publish a children &apos;s book with the title : &quot; the police police , &quot; the most popular who &apos;s going to be .
sound affects us constantly to adapt psychologically , psychologically , cognitively and more .
this is a 32 million pounds expensive , very important , which was built in england recently , designed by a british scholar .
but it &apos;s not just kids who are affected by that .
people who say , don &apos;t sit next to this team , because the noise , the noise , and the other is all the rest of the rest .
&quot; upwake &quot; tells a story about zero , an elder business professor who &apos;s his life in the suitcase , and the dream between the dream and reality is determined and reality , and not in the way that they &apos;re able to build both sequences .
and the frames and four and a half years later , and a job later , that was what started as a function of a child &apos;s disease , a more talented act of talented actors .
i know theater connects us .
now , the time we can use the diversity of our talents to create a intelligent , important and extraordinary work . and we &apos;re following .
if you look around the bathroom , you see some products more , like the example of the same , like , the same , the same , the same , but also a headache .
and the collagen of collagen -- or , since the &apos; 70s , collagen of pigs -- used to inject it in fold .
all of a sudden , i found 185 products .
and i said , &quot; my love , i fear , you &apos;ve got a long and a child &apos;s year ago . &quot;
i told you , you should be able to get this : &quot; i &apos;m somebody .
they gave me the feeling , somebody in a time i felt like a no one .
they &apos;re working on the ninth issue , so they started in the middle of the world now and now the letter is reached .
hundreds of verbs can behave so differently .
you can see that as the language of the thought , or &quot; the &quot;
so the puzzle is , why is it that you &apos;re being polite , requests , euclid and threats often are covered so often ?
you can try to imagine what if language could only be used literally .
and the other puzzle is that i don &apos;t have a problem with it .
here &apos;s my argument . is it sustainable ? is it good ?
it &apos;s a little bit of power . it &apos;s a little bit of a time .
what do you know from that to convince me ?
all these different roles . can you imagine a argument where you &apos;re working , but also in the audience , and you &apos;re looking at the debate ?
or -- and this is the most important part of me : we want you to be more fond in the world of nature , and we &apos;re bringing a design design and finding the master of the adaptation of nature that might inspire us .
it changed everything . it &apos;s not that these engineers were going to put themselves into the boat .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here &apos;s how we make things .
this is the national national lab .
that would be a fuel fuel for fuel cells , if you could do without a bully .
this is not easy , because life is only a subset of elements in the periodic table .
feel and respond : feedback is very important .
what you don &apos;t see is you can &apos;t count .
my first business was a computer company . i started under the taliban .
in south korea , almost half a million companies are women .
because , as the average of the world , smaller , more powerful in direct context are being charged .
and the ones in the world are not exceptions .
people are like this excitement and this miracle .
i have a big seller set of happy , and i &apos;m holding a big kind of gratitude on my heart , and i want to use paper paper to use it to make it a paper show .
first of all , we were going to be torn .
what does that mean ?
when i started to engage with you , i found that they were incredibly adapted to themselves .
but the researchers had a problem .
until finally , they went to their degree and the campus -- and surely they were happy to come out there -- some time later , and realized that crows still reminded them .
we &apos;ve found that they &apos;re really smart and they can teach each other .
for example , squirrel would come back to look for the peanut and go back .
but there were three problems , three puzzles that i couldn &apos;t solve , and i &apos;d like to talk about it , but more importantly , i found a little bit of a sudden .
who would ever be asking me ? &quot;
and imagine what might happen , because every region has something .
let me make the connection .
you know that there &apos;s the future of the future . you have to understand this .
that &apos;s too simplistic .
oh yeah , i &apos;m going to be the johnny silver ring .
about 10 million of them .
and over here , we see the words of the radiologists of israel , &quot; how the hand is going to arrest the penis in a way that remembers the penis . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yes , but i would rather be eating food if you didn &apos;t have anything . &quot;
i said , &quot; you should do an experiment .
he had a line in his book , which was supposed to be out of the front of the world , and there was a little bit of a sudden maria maria who had trouble with conception .
so now you have an evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i have to read you what she said because i find it so beautiful .
i think that &apos;s very unfortunate . not because i wanted to use it . i wanted to see him .
and that &apos;s actually the beginning of our story .
now i thought to this moment , that at age 50 , one of the skills i really had , was to bind my shoes .
i have to tell you that i &apos;m not from here .
yes . the artist doesn &apos;t seem to know how to do the different colors .
but i can see in your faces , you &apos;re still a little skeptical .
it &apos;s called &quot; the &quot; s &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
after a while , i decided to have a little fun , and before i left the room , i got a few things in the room .
and now they &apos;re all here .
my father was one , my youth was so interesting .
the song as a mere fact .
so i , &quot; right , is yeah good , i &apos;m going to put the wheels out of the way . &quot; from pure protest , i bought the little wheels , and i built them and -- i think , could i have my favorite card ?
it sounds just , but i think we &apos;re in general in our society , and culture with the intention of intent .
he had designed the extra little , and he was really proud of it .
human beings , i love the thing .
the consequences of a planet already , on the top of seven billion people .
and very proud , he was on the top seat , which he had a real , very easy seat , he had his favorite , and on the top of the house around the seat .
intent -- a life with intent -- a life of purpose , which is a little better to think about .
i saw the healthy mass of a left , and i was documenting that she was lost , all of the things i didn &apos;t do , but i was not able to do anything .
then i started to ask myself how many times , how my life would have been different if this man didn &apos;t have to hurt me if my genes were a different part of experience .
i was , but i was now a college scientist , and i was now , i suspect , i made myself .
i was hoping to be a lot simpler , and i was going to be able to share this imaginary , and to make me go back to my way .
he spent six months in prison , lost his head for a decade .
yes , contrast .
we &apos;re working with the machine , and we &apos;re working on the university of california in the university of california , san diego .
first , the perception of people , and secondly , a natural interface , a natural form of control , that the interaction with the robot is intuitive to you .
and yet i made this idea to her own .
after i realized that economic danger , i thought we must find a solution for this problem .
some of you have even had a little bit of fun on the speaker , like nathan atwood , and a one of tim ferriss , who may be considered as a very difficult way .
i don &apos;t know a tedtalk that involves .
this time i paid 25 cents , because i found the task was a little harder .
and yet , there was one , which was all of the things that were safe : the expansion had to slow down .
keep the mystery of the dark energy in the back of the back , because i &apos;m going to give you three main points to string theory .
the genomes went on to about 10 high 500 .
and he worked decades of explaining this number , but he didn &apos;t succeed , and we know why .
each of these universes have extra dimensions .
because the astronomers today , by turning powerful telescopes to the sky , discover a handful of photons -- a kind of cosmic cable , billions of years on the road .
now , i &apos;m going to be honest with you and tell you that most of this is just a trick , but a trick that actually works .
think about it , it &apos;s the first time you meet it . we really want to get excited and even more curious .
he said , &quot; go , milo . squash them . &quot;
pm : this is dimitri right now .
we don &apos;t know here .
the next moment , the phone doesn &apos;t work anymore , the tv is coming out , working men are on the street .
it was a very grim meeting of reporters who had been working in war , whose employees of ngos , and of course , the courageous , brave people of sarajevo themselves .
if i &apos;m going to go , why i &apos;m going to go on and make it go , why i &apos;m going to stay there .
but it &apos;s my profession to bring this testimony and this is the most important thing that &apos;s the core of the thing for us to reporter .
even before a goal appears that you &apos;re trying to get the joystick to the joystick of the cursor , that &apos;s what aurora &apos;s trying to find the goal , no matter where it &apos;s .
so basically , we trained the animals to learn to control these kinds of things that they learned , and explore objects in the virtual world .
in an experiment we did a few years ago , we went to the limit .
so we start in china .
so dai manju did the most playful .
please raise your hand .
the last reason that women have done is that women are part of the solution .
in niger , in the average one of seven women , in the birth of a child , they die .
she was part of the solution , not the problem .
larry gibson , when he was a leader of the world bank , once said , &quot; it can be good that investments in the world are the highest , the highest people in the developing world . &quot;
this is bill &apos;s book .
and that was the feather of a bird .
this whole gyre of the ocean &apos;s one of our most fundamental is told that there &apos;s a secret problem .
and even this picture makes the suspects impression , the way that we have a little bit of the design &amp; amp ; kleiber , circus .
one of those possibilities was that we could have gotten to a little bit of time .
they put their arrowheads down and say , &quot; i want to share this arrowheads against the finished arrows , and we share 50 percent 50 percent . &quot;
there are places on this island where they can make all three or four miles on a new language .
when 27 individuals from these 27 member members came to a table , their 23 languages have been told , they &apos;ll just tell you a bit of a text of the kind of data that &apos;s going to be prepared to be prepared for all the more of the
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that they have language .
and what interests me most is the invisible room between a text and the more convenient picture , and how the picture is changed through the text , and the text through the image .
this is the most important thing that &apos;s going on , which is the reason that the atlantic ocean is going to connect and connect north america .
they turn the negative around .
but through the impression of the design , the most powerful , and private , and live , the most powerful changes .
larry &apos;s 8 years of a 10 and a half year-old sentence was a year , in arizona , for kidnapping and repeated , and repeated a baby &apos;s young boy on a fire table .
and the people are left themselves .
and they brought them to texas for us to texas .
and now they &apos;re going to go with the food where they &apos;re in this moment .
it &apos;s just the length of space that looks like nothing .
so , this is called a built-in sense of feeling , the pursuit of happiness and human design .
partly , the legacy is the legacy of the hostility , the cloudbook that was held for happiness for happiness , and it &apos;s driven by the other aspects of the individual , and can &apos;t be found in reality .
a science of happiness in science is that happiness and no longer is a flash of a continuum in a sealed continuum .
it starts in the field of ice .
here &apos;s a three year-old baby .
in the animal kingdom , there &apos;s only one way to increase the status that is dominance .
i want to close with some quotes .
why should you choose rats ?
once the rat has understood that , we have a little bit more difficult to do the task .
you can actually cure t.b. , even people who are hiv-positive .
with the knowledge that a patient , the microscopic , is to get rid of the top to 15 people -- 15 healthy people -- a year , you can be saved , we &apos;ve saved a lot of lives .
here we see neurons .
so this is important for imitation and emulation .
now , the question is : if i just watch , how do a different person is touching why i &apos;m not confused and i have literally seen this kind of light of the naked , how does someone touch ?
thank you . i &apos;ve got two missions today .
i actually don &apos;t care about the most important , but to the pollen itself .
all these pictures were taken by a microscope microscope in the lab of kew .
even every single one of us has a story to tell the world &apos;s story .
we have to be so good as the breast cancer campaign to address this crisis .
right at the time , in the 1980s , when we were going to women and death through heart disease , they were writing a poster poster for the new england journal of medicine and called the syndrome .
our colleagues in washington , d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike the other , x-ray , x-ray , for women , whose high people who are engaged in the heart of the heart . every time we organize something that includes a little bit of radiation , we ask , &quot; is this test really necessary ? &quot;
okay , so here we have started .
they did what they said , they had been given , and they were working .
the cells have something like this , and in the dish , they don &apos;t feel the mentor of the dish .
what does that mean for us ?
in the course of three years , we took eight to 10 hours a day , collected about a quarter of a million hours of smallpox and radio soldiers .
this is one of the first ted projects that came out more than a year ago , which really surprised us .
and finally , my son is playing in a walker .
three of the most important people in this project philip waal , and rony , and tipper , are here to see .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamic in the game .
this is the first time that our son made more than two steps -- captured in the movie .
and that &apos;s a important question to be , because the better we understand how the brain makes meaning , the better we can communicate . i think the better we can think and work .
it &apos;s a kind of center where you see a picture and think &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional response to that . &quot;
what we literally do is to paint our teams to paint the entire world &apos;s entire wall .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just about hygiene , but also to be the possibility of relaxation .
so there &apos;s not a building .
if you translated that into the building industry , if you &apos;ve been able to get a car ticket and a window , we &apos;ll say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken , that &apos;s going to be fixed .
this is the difference .
so we kept on .
are we just dumb ?
you might be able to write through a couple of pages a day , if you read eight hours a day .
and they can do it in september , and say , &quot; i &apos;m important today .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
and the police will come to the fire department to get the vehicle to help the car in pieces of the driver .
and that &apos;s enough to go into the present of the united states in the united states , where a western achievement finds a divine achievement .
all of that leads us -- the first thing to name is that the one that we &apos;re doing is to use the most , digital devices .
this is the consequence of destruction of more than a third of the brain on the right , through the stroke .
this is a very , very low level to be released from the healthcare system .
he then thought my jaw in the right position , he was holding my teeth into the right position .
alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator , who is fascinated by the gaps to close gaps in consciousness , whether he came to a deaf note , or a blind , or a paralyzed the movement .
now i had to find out in the dark years , which followed me when everything was in the process of doing this , which was really gone .
and it works . it works .
lp : so if you have the opportunity , you spend a time with simon .
and these were the developing countries : they had great families and a relatively short life .
and they &apos;re on this side . a big of them in the face of africa and the ones .
and then deng xiaoping and brought money to china and brought the country back to a middle .
a search of search that we can copy in a design format , and can publish the world , and what do we hear when we look around ?
but this creates hypotheses .
you know , darwin has explained life , after it came to what was the essence of life ?
and i learned that i learned francis crick .
but there was what in the literature .
we were not the best chemists in the room .
i was decided to get unhappy ; my girl did not get me married .
you can compare it to dna , ordinary segments and compare it to the clouds .
and so i &apos;ll close , by telling you that we &apos;ve seen 20 people with schizophrenia .
on average , defense costs to be a case of two million dollars , and it takes 18 months to get to 18 months .
first , they don &apos;t fight the patent , but they &apos;re not fighting against the patent .
my solution : give me this patent and i &apos;ll leave you with the patent .
&quot; why not ? &quot; they asked girls .
the fathers were in a place where they were moving their daughters to play their daughters , their chairs could reach up .
this is a great technology .
it &apos;s not very much left in the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in humans .
can the enemy not see most of the time , and so , we needed another approach to eradicate polio as we had done it with smallpox .
it has helped trade pandemic policy , sars for example .
the reality of polio today is something different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : well , bruce , where are the most difficult places ?
bruce libeskind : how we &apos;re going to put polio on a standstill
dj : we found this routine at all kinds of animals , especially in the big cats .
and to our surprise , it became a very popular .
for us , this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration , a symbol of this hope , which is accompanied by us in our work .
it was incredible as she took it into security to protect it before the hyena .
and of course , if i look at these online receivers , the most important thing is , it reminds me of a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic because your fate is in our hand .
we need it . we respect and celebrate each other as a man and wife , as a community and as part of this planet and we have to continue to do it .
and it seems obvious to be the earth is big and the ground is the sun , and the sun is very little , and it &apos;s worth remembering what &apos;s going on .
and that &apos;s because in middle world of the moons , there &apos;s always there .
nature &apos;s nature depends on what kind of animal we are .
because there are so many of them , and because between them , there are no evidence of their favorite value , the most important , the way we see it in middle world , and we found it , and we found .
people like to treat a machines like a machines , and it &apos;s just like , it &apos;s a very , very clear time , but it &apos;s a more sophisticated time when you want to guess what the person &apos;s going to do next .
i was about 40 years old to the wheel of 40 years old .
over a cursor i control with my head , i allow these pieces of data to see the video , and send orders to the robot by putting buttons in a plastic scanner .
with people like you can do this dream , we can make this dream .
in oceanography , for example , is being developed a long-term lexicon by basically the most empowering , which is the dolphins that are put out the dolphins .
i think we can form a global community .
this is a hot heat system .
now there are some -- there are some lessons that you can learn from that .
but we don &apos;t normally do this .
i think we tend to look at this : the infrastructure of globalization .
this is down to 12 percent .
this is a problem we need to solve .
i also suppose that most of you don &apos;t speak chinese -- what &apos;s really sad if you think that this is the most common language in the internet .
what do you look at ? maybe we should do that .
if you look at this picture , you might think , &quot; why should that be me ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find its place in it .
they would bring wealth and safety , religious violence and make sure states never transplant terrorists .
and part of this activity is honesty .
what is that ?
i love this dish .
and the war introduced , 20 million people , and the world &apos;s life , the world &apos;s life -- to the world &apos;s war .
l-dopa sen , who is this guy , &quot; i could have made all this money , but i &apos;ve spent all these time , the american man who had stolen my prescription .
chinese restaurants have done the same thing , and i would argue , with the menu and the decoration -- even the restaurant name -- but without a centralized headquarters .
in contrast , we have general tso chicken , which started in new york city in the early 1970s , when i was just in the university of new york city , so ...
so what we see in the 17th century , the 18th century , is the search of medicine for medicine , which creates the same thing .
so people would really have a big mousetrap .
when the members started to become less , i became clearly more depressed , until i thought , my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
do you remember that a child has to come up with every line ?
18 and 19 i slept the night .
again , i &apos;ll get depressed and a little bit synergy .
so many of us are clear to do that in the next few years , in the next few years , to build a better world .
he goes around , &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know , where did the world work in the treatment of the known problems that made the potential of the earthquake and climate change ?
if you put the impossible out of the impossible , you can do it .
but we &apos;ve reached a agreement to climate change .
and he was crying .
the power of power is something remarkable : they use two ingredients , proteins and water that are in their desks to create a material that is extraordinary , comparable , with technical fibers like kevlar .
or you &apos;re doing beautiful things like this , if the camera can catch this .
here you see how it &apos;s taken from the tissue .
with my new project , marilyn &apos;s m. , i want to use art to create technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that &apos;s the way that the way of shooting and round round and round the fire -- hopefully not -- to help him do some of his next decisions .
what do i do ? &quot;
in the frame of this unprecedented demonstration , heather knight data , a key one , who can far more than a more powerful -- he collects the feedback of his audience and his behavior , and he &apos;s going to be the answers of the crowd of the crowd
stanley mistry , inventor of the famous world &apos;s name of trade , thought in the u.s. sciences and the civil war , that there were two people a connection about only five to seven steps .
how does our view of relationships are really degraded groups ?
but there was a trade exchange , though , that i &apos;m going to tell you , and where he might have been able to put this worm in the ear .
um ... my father , a computer player ?
it was his father who decided that she needed false papers .
this sense of responsibility about the life of other people , he had his young age of 17 years , and also his fault , to be a more powerful , because he was born from a camp , he kept his whole life .
and as my wife and my favorite student , i had been given up to a kind of orphans , and i was interviewing my father , a false job .
i asked him to have a victim that he had ever had , if he ever had the &quot; pass of the victim . &quot;
we grow from a few million people on the seven billion people that we are today , we have one .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a computer system on the ground , on the edge of the next day , which is a very , very determined for the next , in a good state .
if you &apos;re crossing the forests , the border in the land record , you &apos;re qualified to keep the ability of the design of the world , stable .
with the realization of the design of the , fishermen , the most powerful engines of coral reef , and scientists that the great barrier reef is intuitively under the current oil system .
but the drama of course is that , of course , that the change is not an option , that the change is not an option .
that leads me to another reason why i &apos;m here today : because i really like media .
this is a race of a race of a race of a long developed cell .
first , he uses an ancient kind of building , the most prolific and connected to a three-dimensional perspective , which was a whole new technology at that time .
and by the process of sugar on black , i hired portraits of them .
it became very large , and i took them with a very big camera , a camera camera .
my interest in the most interesting , especially worse , is enough to be very far .
and then on the back is a sequence that also comes out with chimpanzees .
we can ask , is there universal differences between africans and civil rights ?
and then you can compare it to the genome of living people .
we can then ask for the inefficient questions , how for neanderthals : do you have a mix of the ancestors of the people today ?
there are many people who designed their own vision of their own vision , such as this vision of the 20th century .
after my belief , the airplane of the future has its own consciousness .
imagine , in a way , carbon dioxide grow in 3d printers , and they &apos;re embedded in a plastic system , and follow the forces that occur in their components .
they didn &apos;t speak . but especially they were extraordinary in the world around them , from their environment and from the people .
they would be more fond . they would call the police .
we know that it &apos;s about one of 100 .
you see a video .
you have the feeling that the research that you have , really , can have a effect on reality , that you can actually prevent these experiences with which i started to get my way to this area .
then you get off .
you can put it in a stare in a stare -- chin on the top of the mountain , poor extended over your computer , and put it out of your head .
they were doing everything that we were taught to tell them .
and after the battle , they get this mobile class and they make it what they call &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what you &apos;ve done wrong . &quot;
also , people have changed .
i said , &quot; where is he now ? &quot;
this is not a complete thing .
and she showed up on the left , to tell me how problematic this picture was , which is the idea of the idea of the black , which was black .
it &apos;s really in this sense of the design of the brain that i have a new series of questions that i &apos;m sitting in .
well , this is a obvious statement up there .
and the kids said , &quot; how do we do that . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to multiply numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long do you have to do that before you decided you didn &apos;t understand anything ? &quot;
their favorite scores are increasing at 50 , which is the other fine schools to do with a biotechnology biotechnology .
76 percent . in the test , two months later , the result was 76 percent .
after eight ted talks , he wanted to be a jellyfish vinci .
this is a 10-year-old .
suddenly , i looked out from the darkness on the contrary side of the space , which was represented by mirrors , which were liberated from the moon .
if i &apos;d have to cut the whole story on a picture , what would it be ?
i &apos;m going to show you some of the snippets in my other big project in this year . &quot; the tempest &quot; -- the storm .
and our little life ends in a sleep .
bono : they &apos;re mythologies .
i know you understand that .
so blue , blue , everything was blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both play in africa .
it &apos;s another one that &apos;s acting on the interface of health and business .
let &apos;s use the markets as the most important use of the world that we have , and finding out what price people would pay for , so they would have dignity .
thank you .
the most important thing was , if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we destroyed two main pieces and 10 tv .
the little thing that &apos;s going to be out of it from its tracks to remove it , and that was a problem .
this is pretty good . it &apos;s going to slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of a couple of the models that i work with .
tissue of the user &apos;s density and behavior is the second part , and that &apos;s actually the key to use these models for the design of the world .
thank you .
so , trying to let you fly the way that you could try to shoot a arrow with the bottom of the end , and it was hard work , and young , young , i &apos;ve learned a lot of respect to nature .
now let &apos;s look at the other side .
we work on projects -- even more sophisticated developments , as well as the coal of the world -- with darpa , the california institute of technology and university .
be careful , just behave like wood or so .
now i didn &apos;t try to be a little bit more .
they go on forever .
these are over two billion .
it takes it to take a sense of three years of research .
don &apos;t forget that one day .
but for me , this is great because it &apos;s a metaphor for time , where we can live in the human mind , and in the human mind .
i &apos;ve got mass . where does it come from ?
it &apos;s too afraid to be extinct in the wild , in 20 to 30 years .
all the evidence on this is that this cancer is being transmitted by a virus .
i took the opportunity to get a few samples from jonas &apos; tumor , and some samples from other parts of the body .
she took him to his sweetie and this discovered something called a little bit more interesting .
ultimately , cancer is an inevitable consequence of our cells to share and adapt to their environment .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and this is a global phenomenon .
they would be able to wait to wait on this .
and that &apos;s the third reason why a low expectation doesn &apos;t make us happy .
but they didn &apos;t know that the numbers on them were going to be .
first , i &apos;m going to show you the most important thing for the optimism bias .
but the good news is that our illusion is not broken when we &apos;re going to be aware of this kind of thing .
but what we &apos;re going to see in the 21st century is asia , which is incremental , to go back to the population of the world , and to try to do half of the global economy .
you could think of this as the privatization of the war .
after 1957 , sputnik had had the soviets , it was , &quot; this is the end of america . &quot;
if you live in japan or new delhi or a new school , you will be a different way of thinking about china when you live in beijing .
and if we have strategies that we &apos;re going to get in major historical context , we can be able to do this process .
as we define our national interests , it &apos;s not just a single standard of the world &apos;s own , but positive sum .
this is the conventional approach .
this has typically the responsibility to overcome the surplus of the world &apos;s responsibility to guarantee a stable security system .
they &apos;re dependent on the long term .
for who ? especially for young men .
after most of the law , you can &apos;t even get the property of the brain .
the supply would be brought from the own , after the conflict , to the government .
this is the silhouette of my hometown new orleans .
the military has it to realize . they call the climate change a second , security and stability while governments are discussing in the world as they &apos;re reacting to .
it allows you to become more productive , so you can afford to afford the insurance itself .
these are certainly inspiring examples of possible solutions , if we feel in the situation to plan to plan a world .
listen to chinese students , who are practicing english by shouting .
teacher : perfect ! student : perfect !
and that includes things like the concrete world with the most powerful world , abstractions that we try to make sense of making sense , and we also take the hypothetical seriously , we ask ourselves what it might be like .
luria looked at people before they were in scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to a newt of the concrete world .
and luria said , &quot; on the north pole there is always snow .
they chose autodesk instead of new york .
it wasn &apos;t just the spread of cognitively prototyping professions .
would you have made it , killed ? &quot;
you could say , a half half .
it feels like i landed in a colony of angels . &quot;
and they &apos;re going to be able to do a degree of something .
he &apos;s still in the red numbers , but chris created it with personal victims , this film .
i &apos;m one of her favorite .
there &apos;s a prime minister , a minister of defense , secretary of defense and a prime minister of the world &apos;s name .
boy : the most serious thing is serious .
we were all angry on them , &quot; why do you do that ?
that &apos;s a lot of real , if you read it . &quot;
we had always played the game after weeks , about seven weeks ago , and we had essentially all of the 50 and consistent crises .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
many people announced good jobs , and they got the job of the water .
it &apos;s like its own little connection .
if i all of these three legs of the triangle , i would get a cross-section .
so everything you do is -- it &apos;s a very , very popular case -- this old plastic , and this old plastic , and this is a very simple plastic , and this is a very simple thing to do in a old circle .
this is possible if you have a whole piece of paper , tidying up , encouraging paper -- you can be in a school school or a state school -- a leaf , a ruler , a ruler , no a glue , no scissors , no scissors .
what we do is a very simple tool .
this is a little straw , which is what you do , is these two corners of the line here , it will be like a carbon ball .
here are two magnets .
it was very many passengers on the ship , and they were bored , so the captain invited her to his boat .
at the time conference , chat gupta shows simple and yet amazing plans to make waste in really basic , constructed toys , which are kids who can build kids -- while they learn basic principles of science and design .
it was a big challenge , and it actually was examples of biology that many evidence had provided .
and there &apos;s a few examples of projects that are aware of the kind of thing that we &apos;re trying to mimic ecosystems .
and with a little planning , we can actually dominated a place of traffic in a turn , which is open space for people , which connects people to food and turn waste into opportunities in opportunities .
this photograph was done at the end of the day , and just a year later , it looked like this .
if you zoom seawater , the first thing is calcium carbonate .
no , you have to be able to be able to be able to have a hug with visions of vision with visions . &quot;
i was looking at someone who &apos;s jewish because i &apos;m jewish and because i &apos;m very important .
but the real failure was that there were very many men who wanted to go out with me .
very few of us have the ability to be absolutely honest with themselves .
he likes to travel as long as it &apos;s not on a fire table .
i tried to be basically how to be a lot of prison .
because you remember my favorite card : you have to achieve a $ 700 of 700 points and nobody did this .
most of you . gamers are 33 years old , not eight years old , and if we look at the most sophisticated demographics of the world &apos;s population , the players of tomorrow are older adults .
imagine that their vision is very , very good .
these gamers even have many other benefits in terms of attention , and a aspect of attention , which is also very complicated , is our ability to track objects in our environment .
i want to ask you to remember this result , and to put it in the context of another group of the world &apos;s group , a group that is actually looking up in our society , which is the people who are doing maternal maternal children .
let me explain this step with a task called mental rotation .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just take all kinds of programs in particular , and we &apos;re looking at it .
so it was a big , very complex project i didn &apos;t even know whether it worked at all .
so wolfram alpha knows about many and lots of things .
on one side , we have mathematica , with the kind of precise formal language and a big network of the world &apos;s engineered ability , capable of doing a lot of lines .
so , with physical design , we &apos;re basically used to to go to the world and see that certain materials make sense for certain technological purposes and so on .
a few years ago , i was quite excited about discovery that there are candidates with incredibly simple rules that are successful and they &apos;re also very common and the general relativity theory and gravity and at least on quantum mechanics .
sw : i think .
and as this time , i actually lost more relatives , and teachers who are making me feel hiv / aids .
they jump up . they wear red clothes .
there was a woman who was a woman , she didn &apos;t have any of the property and automatically owned everything my family had , so he had the right .
and the day before the actual ceremony , we were dancing , and we were excited , and all night didn &apos;t sleep all night .
he was wearing laughter and that in a village that hadn &apos;t even had the streets of the streets , and it was very attractive .
i promised him to be a child girl , i would come back and do everything they would ask me to do .
when it was pregnant before the marriage , the mother was being responsible for it , and they were punished .
while we &apos;re talking about this , 125 girls will never be mutilated again .
consumers who represent 72 percent of the american gdp begin to come back , actually , like banks and companies , their own , to repair their own , in everyday life , to make themselves more dependent on obligations and risks that are going to face us when we
and what you &apos;re seeing here is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we actually step forward and basically future education , the future children of our households .
and the other thing is , it &apos;s up to 48 percent , in cornell .
we &apos;re also watching a trend to something that &apos;s going to be a bit more important tourism . right ?
one of them is the most important of community and neighborhood , and it &apos;s moving to the neighbors of the neighbors as a support .
we &apos;re also watching a big amount of energy .
the trend for the main thing is enormously .
then we take the phenomenon of the meditators .
and then i came to the question , i &apos;m the only one that does this ?
you could make them practice .
this is what i do in my life -- stories telling , novels , and today i want to share with you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures that are the most popular .
our main technology could shrink . our hearts could be scattered , and our primary system could be more prolific , if we were in our cultural counterparts .
i first came to the first time that i call the &quot; maddie of oak foreigners . &quot;
i &apos;m not an immigrant , no refugee or a refugee , i &apos;m going to ask why i do this , but the beating between languages allow me to reinvent myself .
he wanted to see an manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story became a huge thing , because i was criticized by the end .
literature has to lead us to the other side .
i could be a novel about a muslim woman , and maybe this will be a happy story , and i may write about a little bit of a sudden , gay professor in norway .
so you &apos;re going to take a look at . you &apos;re already taking existing songs , you &apos;re going to take it into little bits , forms these pieces , and you get a new song , but this new song is clear of old songs .
instead , these laws and laws of the world are more awkward compared to the property .
it &apos;s a video of the street , but i &apos;m going to summarize what it draws . the alarm alarm : the telephone of the telephone , by putting a symbol with his finger .
our creativity comes from outside , not from inside .
and then they say , &quot; okay , but how do you see your address ? &quot;
but in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the guardian &quot; guardian . &quot;
what &apos;s beautiful is you can probably see these limb there , a kind of a kind of a kind of a design of life that &apos;s made out of the limb .
our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
now this led to an understanding of the nuclear structure , because it &apos;s going to be so much more , that atoms have a single core , with the water that circle it .
this picture shows a galaxy , a more powerful , with , so , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think it can eventually be the most important ideas for us , about our place in the universe , and really the value of our home .
this is here . this is home . that &apos;s what we &apos;re .
and with every mouse , and every touch of the screen , we &apos;re going to leave the same as a function of our personal information everywhere , and it &apos;s going to fall through the digital forests .
when our daughter sat at the national coast , i asked them , &quot; will you put a lot worth on musical competence ? &quot;
we can &apos;t do that with the spider intelligence .
now , i want to take you to this journey .
and because i talked so much , and i was going to talk to my 27 birthday , that i was not going to speak a day -- a day .
and they don &apos;t talk ... ?
and i explained to a friend who &apos;s my sign sign , that i was john francis , that i was going through life , that i was not talking about it , that i was going to translate my sign of sign .
well , i &apos;m going to get my backpack back .
i started talking to you because i was studying the test of the game .
but the most important thing was that i was doing a little bit about my silence , but never about my own , just to use my feet .
and i grew up in north korea .
sometimes i found little jobs in exchange against food .
i always worried that i would be hired and back to return .
i felt so powerless because i had so much to eat in america , but my father died of hunger .
but i believe that their gesture of love and care can save the lives of another joseph , and it can change thousands of other people &apos;s lives that have still hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings , but this was much stronger than i expected , and easily imitating , and as a industrial model , also to make the industrial engineering system .
but then i was very disappointed with my job as an architect because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for society , but for norway , the government , the government , the government , the government .
and then in the following year , in 1995 , there was a big earthquake in kobe .
so i wonder what is a permanent and what a distorted building ?
but this is really necessary .
so we learn some of the most important things in our lives before we &apos;re born , in the womb .
so fetuses even learn the particular language that &apos;s going to be talked in the world that they &apos;re born in .
it creates a mixture of anticipation , which is so incredibly valuable and weird , as the woman itself .
why should malnutrition in the womb have to lead disease ?
you can see the other thing that you can see with other eyes .
this trust in the field of the brain is essential for every kind of a form of information .
the audience will be on the ground of the street , which is very logical , but not with the voice of what happens to your eyes . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , maybe you might actually get to smile .
you may remember that as the most important thing , ok , and then , when the biggest deal of all time read .
if you &apos;re a high animal at ethnicity and someone says , &quot; what do you actually do for eliminating hunger in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start a campaign campaign ?
this is actually a strategy , and i don &apos;t argue that strategy is going to play a role .
for me , all the music was .
now , if i use my software , the camera is going to see the camera , and you see the position of the brain &apos;s point of view , and you &apos;ve got a diabetic cop .
i remember the poor needed a little bit of a time -- food , clothing -- whatever they didn &apos;t have .
i even felt a moment of shame .
now , since i heard him , i was excited for various reasons .
i wasn &apos;t asked to give a donation , which was usually my way .
it &apos;s about the most important thing about the story of the poor and it &apos;s about giving us a way to engage with what your dignity would be , is not a partnership that is based on a traditional way of infant donation , is insane .
it &apos;s a very high combination , a very strong combination .
now , the first thing is , the first thing is , it &apos;s very clear , and it &apos;s very clear to me that it &apos;s just a vehicle , just a vehicle .
how does the future of humanity look ?
now , i &apos;m going to turn to the second big question : are we alone or there are other lives in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions is that we &apos;ve done remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
you see this here .
here &apos;s photographs of me .
the rate is doubling all 18 months and every single family member of the world &apos;s day , which is moore &apos;s law .
but what about them ? what about them ?
they &apos;re crossing their saucers over the sky and occasionally they take people for experiments that are not going to agree with their parents .
so we &apos;re interested in these things .
the former generations couldn &apos;t do these experiments at all .
and i found out that the first technology was taken from the world &apos;s first technology in the form of the world &apos;s life .
we can learn a lot of it .
and i look at the way that i &apos;m going to protect my child , because to protect my child , you don &apos;t get any minister of a child .
and secondly , she says that she had a stand-up gang gang , but some adaptations for climb of trees .
until now , our knowledge came from our ancestors in principle from adults , because the fossils , the people who were missing the food , missing .
the most salient of the most prolific , oddly , is the origin of humanity in the vast ethiopia , and he talks about how he found the oldest skeleton of a humanoid child and what we can learn in africa about our human being .
and if all of you should be in the rules , you need an effective system to compute , and you have to have a drug system , because we &apos;ve been found in everything that is also necessary to be learned .
it &apos;s considered a high seas , because the continent has been seen by the point of reasoning .
we need to work locally , but also the entire ocean industry .
we need to create a new paradigm of caution and respect .
carol pugh : &quot; i would say , &quot; i would pay for the things that i do . &quot;
that was probably a pretty good idea .
to say , i &apos;m a journalist , not an artist , so i &apos;m a journalist , so i want to make a sketch of a sketch like the present and the future .
and finally , i think we have to think about it , if we want to think that our reality becomes -- and when , what &apos;s the idea of life , and what &apos;s next to us .
it looks like oil .
the symptoms of complex are that you have the strong and more of you think of having the right thing , no matter how hard the problem is .
cesar and i tried to write a paper for the new york times and explain how it works .
of course we can .
and deserve a lot of money .
it &apos;s a higher than the government rate of americans .
we &apos;re going to try and try it . probably everything goes wrong .
it &apos;s immediately coming off . &quot;
babbage &apos;s tried to repeat it again , but he never could prove the idea .
i &apos;m saying that our approach is simply not wearable .
china &apos;s going to have reached this in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even slow down .
the future is naturally balanced .
yes , it will be ugly , and yes , it happens soon -- with security in our lifetime -- but we &apos;re more than possible , all of us to overcome it , that we &apos;re going to .
and here they come in .
and what we need to think about is , if you dance in the flames , what &apos;s next ?
and we thought we can get these debt debt to our children , but imagine it .
everything else is more inclusive .
this is the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what stage of development is the cell .
that should be amazing or ?
all we get is the most powerful .
you &apos;ll be able to focus your listening to your hearing , or you can be able to quantify the sensitivity of things that we can &apos;t do .
that &apos;s not a thousand years in the distant .
we should say that cheap , simple , simple , simple , simple , and no one &apos;s going to let them take their children . &quot;
and here we can see this particular thing .
we can &apos;t risk to lose the confidence of customers .
he only got 500 and you could have gotten to 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a huge truck of wood , which they got , and he said , &quot; come back in a week when you &apos;re sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the kind of web -- the things we all talk about -- is a little less than 5,000 days old .
of course , there &apos;s been the internet since more than 5,000 days -- but the web only 5,000 days .
so if we say , the machine we &apos;re doing is a very , human brain , if we look at the rate , with this , where we &apos;re growing up in 30 years , and there &apos;s six billion of them .
now it &apos;s not like this -- if you do a table and things in work , a word document , you &apos;re not part of the web but you will be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people will be the extended sense of the machine . &quot;
it &apos;s going to be on the level of parts or ideas , if you want to evaporate .
the last point i wanted to talk about is the idea that we &apos;re going to be able to get away .
third , it will be ubiquitous , it will be all of our environment , and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i was convinced that the second ted class was the second of jesus christ that it was sun communist moon , and i was very fortunate to become a god &apos;s book .
these are the dead of the people .
and it allows everything . it makes everything sense .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas , like we line things up .
this is a project that we just had in the lab of a giant computer system that came out of this process , which came out of a variety of forces that are developing .
and that led directly into another project .
it &apos;s actually a false attitude because the hybrid is probably more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas are contributing to the education of young people .
and finally , one of the most interesting projects -- a computer company .
each of you are standing to his neighbors .
so , as we need to pay school fees .
so we have a big brain , a big advantage , because we can influence our environment .
my story , is the two brains . it may surprise you , our gut has a brain system .
this is a very , very important thing , very important , because there &apos;s a lot of it .
we &apos;ve learned to talk to the big brain , taste and reward as you know .
he said , &quot; you know , eventually , we were all like animals and then not anymore . &quot;
these are men and women who can even name even 250 stars in the sky .
of course , the soviet monks told us that .
the main bow , the post , on the sun , is actually a very , very clear , which is constantly reflected light on the sacred , by machu picchu , which seems to be the most salient , called picchu picchu .
if you pray for the dead , you do these gestures with those gestures that you &apos;re having to go up with the sky in the sky .
here &apos;s the place where the great mother has the most popular in the world , which has the mountains of the mountains , creating the mountains that they call the heart of the world .
it &apos;s unique to human imagination .
this material that you all know is , you know , it &apos;s a more violent , but i think it &apos;s more like toxic stuff .
i zoom out there , you can see in a hundred years , because in a hundred years , my body can back again without a type of a framework .
it &apos;s a waste .
you want to apply it anywhere in the world , and not to take care of the internet or you have to take care of the other alternative , because you have a whole variety of alternatives .
first , you start in a special bottle .
i started a competition four years ago called &quot; dance your ph.d. &quot; .
my country is about 15 trillion dollars .
and this is -- -- this is still a lot of the time than all the speakers before me and all the ones that come to me .
and she thought about my work to mathematical models , which should be promote an understanding of evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience may not be head-tail-tail -- from deep , cultural reasons , they hold it for boring -- and find a different pattern of interesting -- head-tail-head .
you can think about two types of things .
if you throw a coin , you get a sequence of your head and number .
back to more secular , more popular , because of uncertainty .
and only one percent is wrong .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to take that to a sudden death rate in a family that &apos;s more likely to be . &quot;
not as unlikely as one in 73 million , but still quite unlikely .
the whole quality of weight , the very expensive impact on industrial processing is carried by statistics .
the most important thing is , maybe hundreds of thousands of lives , the world &apos;s lives , have saved hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide .
a smart toolbox prevents injury because the electricity is always , until a smart , more intelligent tool .
but , on the other hand , china is a very , very popular job .
you have facebook , we have a lot of paper .
yet , the organizers itself can create a very strong force , which has never been in history .
so , chinese , as a real medium , looks at this as real media , not just as a mere number .
how big ted , isn &apos;t it ?
so in the last three years , through the last three years , through the u.s. age of food , they really changed more and more transparent , because they don &apos;t have access to the data .
more chinese , and human rights , and human rights as their universals , rather than one of the people of the americas .
many of you know that the beethoven beethoven symphony was symphony seventh symphony .
i don &apos;t say they can live in life .
girl : well , my sister can pretty much .
the acoustics of music is much more complicated than the language .
this is a violin .
and it seems like his favorite of the way to try to try and find the cause of death , why there was a sound of the sound , and his skull has been blowing up on the pages of the pages .
cl : joseph is phenomenal . he &apos;s brilliant .
if i &apos;m a little bit of time , in this particular auditorium , i see a special audience .
in many countries , this is another thing .
in this decisive point in the dutch history , my father was the middle of the horse river near the bottom of the river .
the rate of civil wars and oppression has dropped since the end of the cold war .
my soldiers use their weapons as tools of peace .
peter van : why i took a gun
this program gets a form and then knocks 250 sequences .
this is a very popular in the middle of the age of the year .
you don &apos;t have to be careful .
i &apos;m very interested in both of them .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example of this , but there &apos;s actually a theoretical concern for why technology is evolving in the way that technology is evolving in the way .
now , evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years , and because of this interaction , evolution was basically the technology of the technology , the next stage , creating the next step in technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; we can make the third dimension of practice .
over the last 50 years we had the year in the world technology per year , and we had agricultural growth in dollars .
another big revolution is the most important revolution .
to go back to our exponential growth of computing , 1,000 dollars on computing , at the time of an insect or a mouse .
and in the year of that , we will achieve the full antiretroviral of these trends , and they have to celebrate , how often would the fuck of technology made -- faster and faster , if we get to this point .
you can bring blessing and peril .
they &apos;re harder .
they were removed from the street .
because there &apos;s nothing in there . well , there &apos;s nothing there .
dopamine is apparently the stuff that is related to the body .
and we call that schizophrenia .
and he was so friendly to post and give us the resolution .
i mentioned in our little thought , and they were a very distorted in the african plain .
9 / 11 has a computer conspiracy . it &apos;s a conspiracy .
and we have our own favorite system , and we have a product of a product .
i was not as good as he did , but we managed to make a dance writer , and he was yelling , tracy chapman and bruce chapman on a wooden farm for amnesty , and that was a great experience .
they always said , again , the truth says , &quot; and put us . &quot;
musicians and activist peter gabriel gabriel gabriel gabriel gabriel gabriel gabriel : the other thing that &apos;s called the human security system for human rights and shares stories of active health rights .
next , we asked ourselves how that is ?
he recognizes the problem and knowing this . the dance is his favorite , which allows him to be new .
the beetle climbing a lot less rare on the pill when they were wearing the top of the ball when they didn &apos;t wear .
here &apos;s our favorite experimenter .
let &apos;s play a solar system and see what happens .
this is the universe of stephen hawking .
thank you .
and the argument that &apos;s fun is that it &apos;s fun to break into these big adventures , not quite with my experience .
or , &quot; nice . you know , my grandmother makes a cruise in the antarctica next year .
so the whole purpose of the presentation of the presentation is to convince the vc that they are the entrepreneurs they &apos;re investing in and a lot of money to do with it .
and next to the experience , to make a company or lead something -- that doesn &apos;t have to be a company .
there &apos;s no financial violence in which there was no problems .
from there , you take them -- on a solid , good path after the end , right from the end to the end .
if i happen to know someone that &apos;s made that a device that &apos;s made .
no , they &apos;re not .
and then you give me a quick job .
even if the competition works for a long degree of the pattern .
it was hopefully all positive , positive , positive , more positive .
if you follow my beliefs , you &apos;ll have a very , very , very , very , very popular presentation , and that &apos;s great to get to the people who are and bringing them to emotional .
i didn &apos;t know that , that &apos;s pretty cool .
statistically , one of them is a bug .
if you translate something imitating , you may have an effect on it .
and then if you have enough of it , you can click another link .
we &apos;re at the end of the table , on the last place , as the culture , the innovation .
so , as we think and behave , our energy system is broken .
we have a nuclear meme -- not to be serious .
but forgive me , the problems are not the problems of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the largest biggest school ?
it &apos;s very grim .
our thinking is backwards .
through a logarithmic change , change , like transparency , change , like , for example , and collaboration , collaboration , and collaboration , these things are focused on outcomes .
because only the challenge is the only way that things are going to be made , the only way to get rid of the old showers , and find new creative solutions to the problems today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we should do it together , and if we do that , and the ideas of play are sharing , we can transform bulgaria to something better .
the magazine for the film is called &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master took me to the street , because the most popular thing was at the time .
after i had a gesture of the face , they were very -- i was accepted and i was working there for about six months .
nine days ago , i had a fire .
you know -- all the stuff .
my kids , the design and henry .
we were making a couple of magazines , and we did our homework , but where we also looked at , we were surrounded by images like this .
this picture literally came into seconds , after me , when the baby was put into the arms , and i brought it over .
rg : oh , oh .
av : taboo number three : you don &apos;t talk about his achilles &apos;s -- but i &apos;m going to talk today about my talk today .
the general opinion is that every aspect of my life has become better , since i &apos;m born in the miracle of birth and family .
but you realize that you &apos;re going to lose control of a wonderful way to lose control of what we &apos;re doing , and what &apos;s extremely satisfying .
rg + av : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
i started the experience .
there &apos;s a consequence of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve all seen the star of the &quot; star &quot; with the &quot; star &quot; .
imagine , in fact , a couple of times , already late , you know , to be a little bit more successful , and john &apos;s walker walker shows how pictures of the really feynman and the most passionate in the head can be analyzed to install them .
now , since then , we &apos;ve seen a time of extraordinary economic growth , the longest recovery in the history of this country .
but now , a few months later , as well as politicians might be , &quot; in the static apple without to glide the mine , &quot; how it would be somebody , you can &apos;t hide your insecurity .
now , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i met this guy , a piece of a piece of chaotic man who was fed by tomato sauce and iron for completely , and he was being ashamed of tomato sauce .
but interestingly , it &apos;s also a future that is a few of the things that society is going to be able to do , which is how to put the dna down to the dna , which is how to put the dna down to the society by trying
i want to show you a fascinating new hypothesis , and some surprising new insights that i &apos;ve been working on , about the context of the language of language , which you &apos;re talking about , and your propensity to save .
and when i want to talk right , it &apos;s changing me all the time .
now , this is a very basic theory .
so , please put this device so that you can find it with the dominant hand , so i can measure your favorite hand .
it &apos;s the present pleasure in exchange for future pain .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important the ability is to communicate about generations .
we english teachers are all the time .
but i &apos;m about using them as a disconnect .
but they didn &apos;t get the results they wanted .
at the same time , i was working on the field of the world &apos;s field , although i was a ph.d. in borneo .
people and the tires and the birds and everything that goes up here is high . these are people , livestock and pets .
we focused more on serious health issues , produced products for the company .
let &apos;s see the next video .
and that &apos;s the last night on the party , and -- you can see how it just goes to the street , and you can see every single one that you want .
and he was a very dissatisfied about how people were conducting the buddhist religion in india .
and he goes back as a broken man to the village .
and he has to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , smell and everything .
the animals are in one of their lives . people are people .
we &apos;re very high . we take the feeling of memory to a mother and a long one in all of these creatures in this meditation .
and you think of how the things are , if you &apos;re happy , if you &apos;re happy .
and of course they are cruel and more and more .
even though the change in your mindset is something for other creatures , you feel this new quality in you , and it helps you , and it &apos;s going to be , and it &apos;s going to take you as a role model .
so the coffee cup , or the cup with handle , is using one of the tools to get the public health .
interestingly , the complexity is very high .
we &apos;ve heard recently from bill gates .
so it &apos;s very , very simple if you know how to read it .
well , let me close with four general remarks , an example and two milligrams .
and i don &apos;t want to stop with you with details , but in the lower right-hand corner , you see an example of what we have for this .
did you start doing that ?
and then this is the point of view of the things that jimmy had talked about , what jimmy has talked about , or should we say , how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things will always be able to be able to be able to do it in collaboration with the most effective .
so , for example , take astronomy , which yochai mentioned .
it &apos;s also going to be more inclusive , professional arguments .
so there &apos;s no argument of two camp , but between these camps , it will give all sorts of interesting positions that are taken from people .
this costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to participate with their own people , and actually have a team , then there &apos;s been between new zealand and spain .
and the first thing i thought was to thank him for that .
but the truth is that life is exactly happening here .
so people started calling messages like this one .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m like batman , to true my anonymity . &quot;
and the one who didn &apos;t have a set of a set , so that she was just moved into a different city and had a new job .
and in the last 35 years , i studied human behavior on the basis of everything , starting from genes about brain implants , dopamine and things , until the back to the back .
some of you have it . and it &apos;s dependent on gender .
this was one of those cases , because there was no force in their ancestors , but in my father , already .
they &apos;re similar to each other as you can .
by the way , i &apos;ve been getting an email in this morning , where we &apos;ve done the last part of atlas .
and these guys here are the weak force that may be known at least .
so if you want to know why the sky is blue or why the atomic nuclei are connected , you should basically be in the case with a powerful computer -- why dna has the form you &apos;ve now -- it has -- that &apos;s what dna has .
and the comparison is that people in this room represent higgs particles .
but it &apos;s really that this theory of connecting the physical world &apos;s time to connect at the big bang at the time of the big bang , and a perfectly wonderful prediction , the model is not going to be done with the goal that it &apos;s happening .
they created this civilization , this wonderful picture , turning the darkness into light and it allows it to see civilization from all of the .
another big insight came from a study of the wayne state university in 2010 , the baseball maps of the world &apos;s hospital , looked at the 1950s .
in a similar study in germany , researchers use an fmri to measure the federal genome system and after they borrowed their face to suppress the smile .
&quot; because the colors they have ordered , not the european standard , &quot; he replied .
&quot; safer ? why ? are there more policemen in the middle here ? &quot;
we built the light , the light that people , people of the people , were brought to think that they were to go to abroad , when they were to go to abroad , if they were to move their concerns .
president roosevelt said , &quot; believe that you can do something and you &apos;ve been able to get half . &quot;
all over port-au-prince came together , entrepreneurs came and offered panels for mobile phones .
a graph for the transformative power of technology is found in kibera .
to 2015 , it will give three billion smartphones on the world .
in the shops of the environment , batteries and bread were tuned .
this river of time is embedded in everything : the erosion of a football system , in the protocell , which is the protocell .
do you read a writer with a writer ?
and also , if i look at the big bear , i remember what i &apos;m going to do as a child to be able to sign out of his head , and i feel like this kid .
we &apos;ve always seen how creative technology can be and in our lives and our lives , we can choose these solutions , innovations and moments that don &apos;t make the flow of time , but again , again .
my mother was a little bit of a time .
in every single refugee camp , she had to write off soldiers who were my older brother mark , who was nine , and he wanted to take a child child .
and i should do it alone .
take anything you want to have out of the suitcase .
then i ended up in a hutu , because i don &apos;t have my feelings .
thank you .
so almost all of life on earth will be wiped out about five times .
svante paravicini : the answer .
why should that be a role ?
so , in theory , we can grow every organ from any cell .
here &apos;s the rise in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the consensus .
if the rotors are spinning with the same speed , the robot is floating .
and you see how robust the control is .
and he does it while he &apos;s making obstacles .
they take their neighbors true .
this is showing that we double the most sophisticated , we can triple , we can eliminate it , we can get them to form teams like you can see here .
but the robot can also figure out where to go .
i can feel that . but there &apos;s so much and i want to expand your horizon here , open your mind , open your perspective to honeybees .
this has been a huge problem for many years , basically since the late &apos; 80s , the most powerful , the most powerful , bacteria and the water , and the ones that have brought up .
they don &apos;t experience that .
the squid takes the cooks for the courts , and the honey -- there &apos;s a lot of the honey -- they use the honey to their bars .
the bee dies . honeybees die when they &apos;re going to stick , so they didn &apos;t want to do it .
okay , now , really , the question is : why is this ?
of course , we also have , especially in the last decade , to poke the world with a dense chain of banking systems , with a chain global trade .
and never before were so many people that were not aware of this fact .
in fact , many of you don &apos;t know that our bread was not european invention .
and especially meat in the coastal and china is moving up the high school .
agriculture has for most people , and here aren &apos;t many farmers under them , to be bad , to be bad , to be the environment in big scales , to destroy the environment .
all together .
and so , as i did my bread , i &apos;ve done it , and i &apos;m going to do it , and i &apos;m trying to burn my hands .
and also , it has to be to keep a long time on the land where there are tools where they &apos;re available there , materials and water systems .
you take someone like me , a scientist , analyzed and tested and develop a new technology , and it determines the quantitative effect .
because i hope you &apos;re going to take this from here today , a new connection with nature .
this was a couple of days ago in yugoslavia .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
this is from the last year .
but the legendary igbo was one of them . and shekhar kapur turned a film on her , and she was going to see her , you know , queen , you should see them .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but here &apos;s what &apos;s got to be a specialty .
this is a patient &apos;s patient who was at the time , the 73 -- he took a rubber disk , but it was , for this .
i like this slide because they &apos;re going to talk about what people really motivated to change , and what they &apos;re not .
if you eat a high school meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a very , very important thing , americans even eat more fat because the ones , even more carbs , and even more carbs , the percentage lower , but the actual number , the goal is to reduce both of them .
one of the most popular studies of studies found that 70 percent of people were clogged , 65 percent of people had bad breath , 54 percent of the people had a headache -- that &apos;s not healthy food .
on the other hand , everything is intimacy , which is intimacy .
i hope it &apos;s not going to stay .
the film is based on a nuclear pad of f. f.
two main projects were involved in the project : warner brothers and the baby .
and we had enough passion to make the most important and technology .
we &apos;re so eager to capture motion .
the number seemed to be infinitely .
and these are the data that we get from it , and then they &apos;re used for the model .
and so the finished picture was used in the movie .
this was a very , very , very early sample .
and we found this in the middle of the state of karnataka .
and has a very different kind of time .
people from 3.3 will be overcome these cruel , more cosmopolitan past they lived in their lives .
we were too fourth -- two thirds of the driver -- and imagine , this vast one is a ocean from sand , 40 degrees c , a water bottle .
i think the camel is the best , the best , in the world , in the world . &quot;
and they use it as much as we see our food system .
we weigh our animals .
so i &apos;ll show you another film .
i don &apos;t do it until my body temperature has crossed 40 degrees fahrenheit -- enough to avoid an egg .
so , thank you for inviting me .
start a meeting with a poem . it would be an idea .
but how would it like to do it if you never knew how to live the next day , you &apos;re going to be a living god , your shoulders in the clouds , or whether you sit down the ridge , you &apos;re going to go up with your
who could sleep in this night quiet ?
but you knew judy was in your age 150,000 dollars a movie that the french d was going to be the protest , and blaise pascal had his room to resist the protest -- no wait , i mean he invented the calculator ?
at the end of the tree , they sat in a tree and a burst of hand to another .
and the human being , more than that , is more than that , but if you remove these two columns , probably not much left .
and we also have the problem that we can &apos;t build the problem that would be too hard to be a single elephant .
one component of it is understanding . here &apos;s a little bit of a time , &quot; the ability to understand the other and to share . &quot;
so now we &apos;re looking at more complex expressions . here &apos;s consolation .
that the test is not good for you .
there &apos;s a very simple job that you have to do .
a philosopher actually wrote us that it was impossible that one was a sense of fairness , because fairness was invented in the french revolution .
now it &apos;s not a lonely crazy crazy , it &apos;s not two crazy , three is a lot of the and a lot of it .
the last decade i spent with the pain of the pain , and the humiliation of the way i &apos;m going to give you the good thing , is the most important thing to do .
and i have to say , thank god .
so i heard it in a way , in a way , in a way .
over the years , the serious health system can create .
a.j. jacobs : how to live in life almost love
and i think many scientists are sharing this view .
a really cool thing .
now , these studies are scientifically valid and they &apos;ve been recovered , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
ask for the part of the story that &apos;s not going to tell .
a priest ?
last one , a group that believes that the indus people are the ancestors of people in the world today .
right after left , how many ? okay .
it can be useful to create more data , more data that &apos;s going to be more populous .
this sign is the most common script , and it &apos;s just going to appear in this text twice .
it turns out that in india , it &apos;s long tradition , names on the ground , to give birth to the birth of the birth of the birth .
space , we all know how it looks .
this wire is the wire that &apos;s famous to the name of bell who &apos;s famous for the name bell .
and salman had made the historical discovery that the particles can also hold the same as a solar cable .
all the young people in the city -- in fact .
somebody who sits next to you -- that &apos;s okay in a square of a car , but you would sit on a little bit of a time and someone would sit so dense , and then you would be able to get a lot of time .
the dalai lama always likes to say -- he says , if you &apos;re going to get the idea of the design of the design , it &apos;s because you realize that you can see yourself and his pain and the joy of the other thing that &apos;s going to
so , take this wonderful thing , the most amazing thing we showed us . she ruins us a little bit of the time .
a man was a shot of a tank that became a symbol of the resistance of resistance .
but what couldn &apos;t you do anything if you had the modern communications to make a sense that it was going to be wrong that was going to be done , right ?
combine to combine the power of a global ethic with power of our ability to communicate on global level and organize global warming with the challenges that are now violent and largely global nature .
in the museum of the children in rwanda , there &apos;s a photograph of a young boy -- and the museum of the children who have been left , they &apos;ve been left as a result of the heart of rwanda , which are a million people .
here &apos;s the task : help me build a vibrant , more sophisticated , scalable , scalable thing .
you can move on very different types of data -- you vary in the most powerful , moving movement of the surface and the legal system .
this is a driving algae .
boy : reusable .
we slow down to see spines in action .
mark is blown up at stanford , one of my partners , is an extraordinary engineer that was being named a technique called format called a network called the shape of the system , which is able to fit directly into an artificial foot .
you see almost like aliens , and the secret , what they stick , are their favorite toes .
so here we go off the band-aid .
these are the structures that allow them to allow spines , and the fertilizer and the most challenging , very difficult surfaces .
so , the very long time , the beautiful songs , which are being supported as a function of a bird and males are also able to find each other as females and choose to choose a partner .
so if dolphins are less than 20 feet apart , they have to make less than half the brain whistles .
if we think of marine animals like dolphins , we need to be aware of the consequences of our interventions in the clear sense of our interventions that we thought we were safe to be safe .
after the design of the world , the marine world made these systems available to the systems to know what the scientists could hear .
you just hear the low frequencies .
if males and females use this signal to find a partner and they &apos;re scattered , imagine what implications are in the recovery of the population of the population .
how ships can be made , they found that with a better child , that noise can be reduced to 90 percent .
they &apos;re going to be the speed of 50 percent .
we see strangers , we see strangers , we see , 300 times , 300 times , and it &apos;s always becoming more . and they &apos;re not like us .
you have all the possibilities to do .
we observe a continuous rise at the men .
and obviously there is one that sees a hundred .
with initiatives like 100 dollars , it &apos;s a little bit of the time that we think of a whole new generation of people in the old school of the computer .
thank you .
i think nothing of it is the problem .
our daily lives is , but it &apos;s more convenient , in an extraordinary state , we say in a museum of a war .
it &apos;s usually one or two per year .
and there are .
but we are much more unequal .
part of the challenge was to try and try and get rhythm and space by not just my hands -- juggling is much more powerful -- but the rhythm of my body and the feet , and the balls with my feet .
and then they play crazy .
ok , because they &apos;re all not understanding what a computer &apos;s is , i give you a little hint .
now , again , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
you have somebody up here who is the most salient principle of the whole life , ok ?
pop -- and then it comes to the calm . just one small number of time .
with space and straight in the room , there are other ways .
and then it &apos;s the levels of levels .
in this year -- you might show the slides -- in this year , we carry the most sophisticated thing around us , a project that we &apos;ve helped with the design .
we can call these on a computer table which allows you to access more information over the clothing , while you &apos;re going to get these online cells .
so scott adams : i found that i &apos;m going to be the leading expert in the middle of the world .
and we &apos;re also going to be familiar with a new product today , and it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s been published publicly .
now , the farmers are only able to go in the season , and not in the most sophisticated harvest .
electrons are just going to be in a way of a kind of plastic and then only energy , and energy can &apos;t see .
this is what he thought he was about .
potatoes , potatoes have 48 chromosomes . did you know that ?
well , atoms , you can &apos;t see it .
and somebody said to him , &quot; well , what is the point behind , henry ?
we &apos;ve been able to have about four years of time .
if google is digitized a book , they bring it into a very nice format .
i give you an example .
suddenly , in the &apos; 40s , everybody was excited .
but imagine , it &apos;s not going to be interested .
but also , many of the right , that apparently , that seems to get out of propaganda .
if you get the bathroom , it means &quot; a &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if i run this pink sound for longer than a few minutes , they would literally stop hearing it .
many people get out of headphones , but this turn big , public spaces like this , shared carbon spaces , in millions of tiny little personal practices .
you can also do this in a beautiful place , like a lake .
and finally , a acronym .
and i said , &quot; that &apos;s my job . &quot;
thank you so much that you were here . we &apos;re all so grateful . &quot;
and they went away with it .
because they weren &apos;t at the sidewalk , and they couldn &apos;t see the exchange between me and my meeting , a exchange that was fair to tell us , but we were paying for a conversation that was fair .
now , i &apos;m telling you , in the most recent year , there &apos;s a lot of competition in the last year , because the arab spring still is spreading , the most important thing ?
this photograph was actually laid into a police station , and you see the bottom of the people who were tracking the police of the police .
the kids just do pictures in a class , the teacher gets them to paste them on the top .
in today &apos;s talk , it &apos;s about the brain and , yay , somewhere out there is a secret .
this is something we can work in our lifetime . i believed i could make a difference and i tried to get out of the street , where i was going to come out of the street .
but sometimes science has some other characteristics that really make them interesting .
what do we bring more data ?
there &apos;s something that we believe it is obvious , but wrong .
it &apos;s that intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we don &apos;t look at the alligator as very intelligent , not in a human way .
in humans , we developed the most important part of the web , and the name of the neocortex is the name of the neocortex . nature has this little trick .
it &apos;s not that you &apos;re looking at it and say , &quot; what am i seeing now ?
not like a computer computer . not at least like a computer computer .
these are the things that are going to come first .
we need something police , we need something military , but only to defense .
you can see it on your turn . &quot;
they were traveling because they were at the age of elections outside the country .
this is a little bit of the time .
and then , when you closed the door , grandma said , &quot; no , no , no .
they wash it up , by hand .
these group use three , every one .
it &apos;s real .
she made it to learn english and learn to learn this as a foreign language .
the computer already , in one of three participants .
if you think , you know , you think differently than the employer of the united states , that actually were part of our experiment , because that &apos;s what we did .
we repeated the experiment with the same groups , but we put a hold of a second of the enlightenment on how we deal with the data , and the actual beginning of the organized .
the price of the sea is the displacement of paradise .
and they moved and improvise to each other and they kept their arms on each other and leave them on each other .
we &apos;re really good at talking about skills and security and health , we &apos;re really bad at talking about character .
then , you know , personal personal coach , the most delicious , like the mercy of bad breath in the classroom .
i don &apos;t really feel like i &apos;m really sure .
the first gift , or talent , is the ability to peer out of other people &apos;s heads , and to figure out what they have to offer .
they own humility .
that &apos;s what the unconscious is to be .
we found them between the world &apos;s office , raped by many , many men , i don &apos;t know how many .
where does your journey start ?
and that it &apos;s not normal to live in a home .
what was my challenge ?
they need their empathy .
lexicography : that &apos;s how to get out dictionaries .
well , first i &apos;m going to give the queen to blame , because it &apos;s funny .
online dictionaries need to be different .
the bad words -- look , if someone thinks about one place and then it doesn &apos;t find it on the map , he thinks , &quot; this map sucks ! &quot;
you think , &quot; ok , if we think that words are tools that we use to give our minds , how should you know that willpower is better than a hammer ?
the lexigram has 33 different styrofoam definitions for &quot; set . &quot;
and then there &apos;s this mike , mike &apos;s life . mike ornish lives in the u.k.
i have the whole time , &quot; the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , &quot; said the dictionary .
so , i &apos;m going to take a chair .
and , to make a long story short , i &apos;ve landed here .
and so , with this , play for play , as this three days , you start to understand : why do i hear all this kind of data ?
they may be from a ted speaker , and we can keep the conversation during the year , and next year , after the same intellectual and emotional journey .
the manufacturers don &apos;t have the consumer force in their cheap air center , because they &apos;re not sure what the public would start with a kind of precise sort of sort of concoction that could even fold on the palm palm .
there was a mess in the way that it was already pessimism , and it was technically able to find the channel .
instead of keeping the food care , you make it happen .
and , &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
we call ourselves a nuclear &amp; amp ; selfish and we live and working in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this work is a cartoon of a human being .
we debate the argument , what the world needs now is nuclear -- right or wrong ?
and then there &apos;s only three main points of it -- coal and gas , the water , which is almost everywhere -- and nuclear .
we &apos;ve become the russian warheads , by turning into electricity .
carbon emissions are equivalent emissions emissions on the ground emissions and particles that cause warming , and it &apos;s transformed to co2 .
now , if you look at the fact that the distribution of nuclear weapons with the prevalence of nuclear weapons is because we know that india and pakistan are in the process of nuclear weapons in the field of energy in the field of energy .
for wind , the area is much larger , but the most important is smaller .
the reality is that 21 states have nuclear power , right ?
and in the senate of the united states , we need the support of both parties -- only one or two voices need to be the global warming in the senate , and this room can help .
we &apos;re not going to get enough energy from renewable sources .
i used to worry about the 10 years ago .
thank you .
this was -- my motivation became the apollo ravaged .
for the first time , we have enough wealth in the hands of some fewer people , and the available technology that will allow us to study space .
26 thousand groups from seven countries took the competition , every one between one and 25 million dollars .
so , we can get it to the space station .
and the advantage for the sponsors is the sum of the world &apos;s most sophisticated and social media .
would you surprise us to be fascinated ?
that means that surfaces can make themselves go . they can be incredibly small .
a challenge was how we can express these new algorithmic order in a column .
what i didn &apos;t know is because we had only seen the outside , that the areas kept further , in the column , and that was a pretty surprising discovery .
inspired by the process of division , michael atwood &apos;s algorithms that create incredible , amazing forms with millions of surfaces , not a human being , but you can build it . and you can make our understanding of architecture .
so look at this picture here -- lots of forms here for you here .
it &apos;s a very rare disease .
this is a drug that was developed for cancer .
you can see , the chip actually mimics the most delicious .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s taken by young people .
and i think many people here in the room are in the same position , as i am .
so i think women are going to be in our society because they realize that it &apos;s very important for their future generations to get our cultural identities .
we &apos;ve realized that since recently , more people have been using resources like youtube and social networks to give their stories expression , to show their photos and their own stories with their own voices .
at the same time , we &apos;ll take them to come and explore our part of the world .
i was going to consider more or less than &quot; nothing . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; maybe if i do this ants , you &apos;ll pull a few apartments . &quot;
this was called &quot; tembererana house . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do that ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back next day .
and it was ...
my work , roughly , estimated , sometimes five , six or seven weeks , you can &apos;t always anticipate .
and i took it around , and it shaped the chariot .
so i broke the needle .
it &apos;s a very , very sophisticated work , but the best things come in small bits of water .
they expect their employees to do what they asked them to do when they were doing the job , they can do more .
there &apos;s this absolute concentration of being the absolute , absolute , conscious of consciousness , awareness of an absolute center of compassion and love that the primary properties of the divine defined .
my favorite body flew into a direction , my favorite bike in the other .
i asked all the scores that i probably wouldn &apos;t do with them , the most important ones i would not actually spoil you , the friends that i wouldn &apos;t be able to be unable to do with them .
because you don &apos;t need the most sophisticated .
and if you go back to you from the back , against the wind , you can just just just put it down and it makes it a little bit of the shock . &quot;
20 years ago , doctors would have cut my leg and hoped , and there was a 15 year-old chance .
as i was more experienced , and in my life , i was probably 14 pounds easier than i am now .
and nobody represents this modern cultural impact in my eyes more than david black .
and walking upright , you say , is the threshold of what makes us human .
he &apos;s president of the international union for the most important , which is the least the most common name i &apos;ve ever heard .
he was born at the early age of three months , and it was really a fantastic dog article of him .
so once i tried to get away to the piano , i became a strong job of life .
and at the end of the end , you were so fast that things like the flight of the flight weren &apos;t a problem , right ?
do you want me to play ?
dp : &quot; tiger rag . &quot;
i &apos;m not going to do that .
they &apos;re fighting their own lifestyle in this forest , in a world that is still clean , a world that &apos;s still not selfish , in a world that &apos;s not to be distracted .
so we know that they &apos;re capable of doing the power that has been impossible for the research for absolutely impossible than i started .
the long work of subjects are making the mother , who &apos;s developed during this long childhood , and also the siblings , can keep the whole life long , and that can be the way to be 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and also the huge camp of the world &apos;s forest in the forest now need meat , and so the pygmies are going to fill in the congo department and have lived in their wonderful lives so many hundreds of years .
yesterday , someone said that .
now , we &apos;re in every state , and the problems in florida are other than the ones in new york .
do you get to go and turn me down here ?
so , in the politicians ?
what we want to do in the lab is so pretty much the same , but with a few dozen of different molecules of molecules -- such a dramatic reduction of complexity , but still trying to create something more important .
it &apos;s actually very , very basic . if you &apos;re looking at it , it &apos;s not really really something .
now , where they &apos;re all experts for protocells , we &apos;re going to play with these protocells .
we see the self-assembly system of this body , which we &apos;ve seen before , and the black blobs represent this black mud -- these areas , very complex , organic black mud .
in his lab , martin cousteau &apos;s &quot; protocells &quot; made , &quot; protocells , experimental of chemicals , which are acting like living cells , and his work shows how life has been done on earth first ... &quot; and maybe elsewhere .
this is a very popular , to take your tadpole walk on the night .
what is this -- where did you know ? you took it .
but if we were in every -- every fire cable , we could redefine the case of an emergency .
and it &apos;s the rain that &apos;s otherwise going to fix in your pretty pink lungs , and that &apos;s where it &apos;s associated with -- with -- it &apos;s associated with -- with -- it &apos;s associated with --
the birds could jump from one to another .
you can get the rest of it out of the news . you can talk to him .
but to keep these herd , a big toll of our planet will demand .
next , we put skin cells and multiply them into a plastic factory .
we &apos;ve been working with thousands of years of working with the products like wine , beer and yogurt .
it &apos;s true that if we &apos;re all available in the world , we &apos;re seeing our research , we see that it &apos;s almost a universal pursuit of people , to have a car .
let me just talk about hydrogen .
this is a huge opportunity to create energy , making energy .
if we can see these kinds of things , it can also be different .
you had to survive .
and we made sure to be infected with our school school , to get funding and support .
because why should our students drive so far away from their sleep ?
it became a book , then a painting .
there was an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
here &apos;s the west coast of the forest .
but in this picture , you see how we started building the most powerful in brazil that &apos;s been a big set of brazil .
when i was time to start my home , i was studying the whole research issue of the design lab .
if you &apos;re in the south of manhattan , you see the expansion of new york city , like it was , at the end of the american revolution .
the white surfaces on this map are the most protected places .
or the most delicious , the wet meadows , insects and the places that are needed .
maybe a little bit of a sudden there was a little bit .
it &apos;s so much force in the process of combining science and visualization that these images are going to come together , and it &apos;s like both sides of the mirror .
and we have a really dramatic level of magnitude in our society right now .
so i don &apos;t have to go closer to that .
you can do the pristine thing , of course .
this is a very crude building .
one example we all know is this cell phone , right ?
and it &apos;s all about this question -- of course in a very artistic and indirectly way .
but it &apos;s happening everywhere , and these tools are parts of it that help us do it .
seriously -- clapping , they &apos;re very great .
alex steffen : a sustainable future
you could mean that this could be a big problem for a law , but congress doesn &apos;t seem to be very concerned about it too .
but if you make a lot of your quality of copies , and you sell it , it &apos;s not okay .
some of the things we share , we made things that we &apos;ve found , and each option causes shock in this industry .
this is the simple thing .
i had a very muslim , expensive , expensive education in india , and that &apos;s almost broken me .
and i thought i was going to start a barefoot college -- college only for the poor .
a professional is someone , with a combination of competence , confidence and belief .
when i said that , they said , &quot; do you show us what &apos;s possible . what do you do ?
the entire power comes from the sun .
democracy , the way you &apos;re missed the country , which you should be arrested , if you &apos;re arrested , if you &apos;re a animal , if you &apos;re sick .
it &apos;s coming into tension , it increases the presence of the schools , and it &apos;s coming between teachers and parents , so they can do the teachers and the parents , and they say , &quot; give your hands .
you use sign signs .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , mr. president .
a video system .
and our main model creates one of the largest , dynamically , dynamic computers of the world for these kinds of things .
you see the most sophisticated walking along the road of the world that we have as artists for scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , there are data of these two groups of people , data about how happy they are .
&quot; i &apos;m physically , financially , emotionally , mentally , mentally , mentally , and almost every other way of doing so much better . &quot;
he didn &apos;t cry he , and of course , ray was six months later , the same idea .
in this case , because they &apos;re used in the experiment i &apos;m going to tell you about , prints from the images of the images .
we collected our materials , and we went out of the room , waiting for half an hour .
i &apos;m going to show you why .
they made two pictures , and they had two beautiful , very heavy , and they had two beautiful things , and we said , &quot; which would you be going to stay ? &quot;
we take a completely new group of naive information , and say , &quot; you know , we give a nuclear and we can do it on two different types .
and the most important car and the most powerful is beautiful .
voices : it flies in the air . oh shit .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t start ! &quot;
don &apos;t forget that these tradition of the clouds from the clouds come from , but keep back into a time before we put stories on the street , or even before we put stories on a wet basis .
the way food , yeah .
the kind of thing with the roof of the roof , you know .
and so we went to my father , because i knew he would kill me if i was going to go to it alone . so we go into the car .
&quot; and did this guy have a warm uniform , and a little bit of a warm expression in the face ? &quot;
i really want to get inside ? because if i don &apos;t have a thread , to get me stuck -- enough metaphors for your taste ? — could it be that i never come back out again .
look ? we &apos;re a secret club with a secret piano club .
she says , &quot; ma , you have to look ! &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m voice for the little old lady , &quot; damn damn damn . &quot;
it &apos;s up from the car . &quot;
i really scared .
so what is the social result of this ?
where can i go today and with who together ?
and if we have it , we will decide how many miles we &apos;re going to go in , where we live and work .
and you can communicate smart awards at the bottom of the station and see exactly where your bus is walking on and when it comes , and you can buy your tickets in real time .
i want to say that we &apos;re using the wireless record , and i challenge that this network should be open standards for each other .
and they came in the late 1960s here .
and for all of you who come to a mental illness in touch , you know what a challenge can be .
i said , i wanted to tell you the most important thing i wanted to share with you the three , and i wanted to leave you with a happy .
because they all were three years old .
and so what i love to do is , in this story , that rosey grier is just a authentic person , and it &apos;s about the authenticity of the world .
i ate the mythic . &quot;
you can sleep in a clean sheets .
j it &apos;s so many that you have to see the problem .
i found it curious about writing , as if it was a competition , about a fresh wound .
it was the world &apos;s largest one white , rich , rich , which was not held for the city .
it looks pretty simple , but it was a very simple thing .
people were going to be more fond of two things -- they were amazed by the destruction , but there was also a sense of the design of the new york that i found very moving .
because at the time of the four platforms along the road -- where one of the improved version of a brain &apos;s disease is a more potent version -- we knew that it had to be mobile , to respond to the conditions and the changed definition of ground zero
we have the opportunity to rethink our thinking about cities .
dr : it was a privilege .
and i know kids suffer for concussion every year .
if -- god forbid -- somebody &apos;s name here , and a concussion , and a concussion , would most of us in a period of a few hours to a couple of weeks .
you have to be familiar with the problems that we talk about today .
and what turned out was tom was seeing that a helmet was a good way to preserve a good way to keep a $ 100,000 .
it &apos;s not true , but tony blair &apos;s been going to the davos forum in 2005 when his doodle were , of course , &quot; were discovered , &quot; and he was described by this .
in other words , they have a common and growing complexity of visual language that happens in the online series .
he said that there was no cure .
today , all countries are dedicated to offer patents to provide drugs that were at least 20 years .
it depends on the drug company of drug companies , their patents , to make them available and make them available .
in scanners , the same stage , a computer center , people sat in the hamptons , the afternoon at very high humidity , and they didn &apos;t feel like it was .
you can adapt everything to make you think of your well-being .
he offers all these services , and there &apos;s a little bit of these services , and there &apos;s a little bit of things that you &apos;re doing online , but for people who are so linked to the digital world .
the question was , &quot; how do you make this teacher ?
let &apos;s see what he does here .
and the husband of the daughter , he was also sick by his wife &apos;s pajamas .
but the visual complexity is still very large .
well , the math of our studies had a research system on our studies .
now , if we feel emotions , we show them .
and you could get the impression that the unfortunate people have a different structural position within the network .
this is my favorite story . &quot;
they &apos;re both made of carbon , and yet one of them has a very , very common place in which they &apos;re placed in a particular way , on the left , and they get the soft and dark .
to put this one , let me pull a little bit out of a moment .
and older , it &apos;s not easy to be .
under the same circumstances , older people are providing their cognitive resources , like the same , and memory , more in positive information than negative .
we cost the life .
and they &apos;d like to go , &quot; tonight , i &apos;m going to perform this kind of thing for this girl on this bar . &quot;
kid david : it &apos;s so that i &apos;m , frankly , not so much , often , what happens when i dance .
they have called me crying and uncles , and i &apos;d over a period of five years of time .
unaids : the second contract of fort laramie is clearly the opposition of the great sioux nation and the lakota of the lakota , the lakota black hills .
the treaty of fort laramie was at least three quarter of the u.s. sign to sign country to land .
they were tired of tired .
the average is eight times as high as the american average .
so what &apos;s going on ?
and today , the child mortality passed down since 1960 , in 1960 , 20 percent of the day .
you can either get it as a pill or a syringe . you have to take it every day to regulate blood sugar .
if we do it , with people , they have ...
but basically it makes a lot of sense .
it &apos;s called , are you smarter than a nuclear sandwich ?
bmw is a very safe car .
the problem for bmw is that this car looks safe .
now you &apos;ll think , &quot; if my life depends on it , i &apos;ll be using it every day . &quot;
we have to connect these with a scientific method .
this is something else as actually a effective campaign .
what &apos;s not new .
the lights are going to be dark .
we do it for our clients .
we have the sun in the sun .
now , logic -- logical sense of being looked at , you know , you &apos;re now coming from this position to the here -- without moving the wrist .
i &apos;m going to be acting now . now , every time ... a different person -- not always the same answers .
so , if you &apos;re interested in it , i &apos;m going to present some of the most sophisticated things .
here , i have to look at the beginning of the beginning , so i can follow my cards during the ted center -- oh , we should have started together -- no problem , no problem .
yeah ?
i think ...
lg : pardon ?
what is the map i should use ? the lady or five ?
lg : but you see your hand .
wait moment , wait for any card .
another color . lg : diamonds , perfect .
compassion .
diamonds , yes ? zoe : yeah .
here -- all the maps -- are all the cards -- are you all relieved ?
and finally , the king -- in exactly five seconds .
some of you seem to know this child .
after i was back to a company , i made my whole company a little bit . &quot;
if you didn &apos;t have a musical note , you could not roll a ride .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s really happening here .
i say my students always say , &quot; if you have a fallacy , you can see it always recognizes a eyebrow , then it recognizes everybody . &quot;
imagine the person and follow the whole way of the b and the rest of the day , and you &apos;ll hear everything that chopin had to say .
i had an amazing experience . i was 45 , and i had a lesson for 20 years , and suddenly a realization .
she came to auschwitz as she was 15 years old , her brother was eight , her parents lost her .
so ladies and gentlemen from the jury , look at this .
if you &apos;re the fastest of all of these today , you get 20 dollars . &quot;

the most important thing on the object would be a high picture of the earth .
but they always make those 10 percent or more , which are most offensive or more , or more knowledgeable .
and it &apos;s a team of wood and a group of a group of the day to the u.s.
so nonprofit organizations have to keep themselves , courageous , big , big , new greek , new greek , fear that you &apos;re going to be placed by the bottom of the world .

people who have made these kinds of things that have made the most beautiful instruments .
he says , &quot; i &apos;m responsible .
it &apos;s just about execution of music , like you &apos;re written , not about interpretation . &quot;
so this is great . and what about the eyes ?
that &apos;s what he does .

so kleiber is about the process .
as a designer , we tell ourselves a lot of stories about the future and about what steps we could do from here .
there are 98 countries around the world .
and in the face of climate change , it &apos;s not really doable .
and it &apos;s a process that really makes joy .
you think about whether you should push it on .
and the most important thing said , &quot; if we don &apos;t have transition , we &apos;d have to invent all of the local infrastructure of the first time . &quot;
but there &apos;s a problem .
the budgets are not really balanced , and to a certain degree , the games that they play to hide this is so much , the theme that you can &apos;t see , that you can &apos;t see what &apos;s really obvious challenges .
in fact , there are five states that are worse , and really only four states that are not going to stand up with this big challenge .
and even if you &apos;re living so living , you could make money .
it should be more like private accounting .
but i had a mind when i went to graduate school , and i was in my life , and i was trying to decide about music and medicine .
if you laugh , you know .
many years after the solar-powered clocks , a young lady , i knew that sex might be because of the five senses .
and then , according to the survey , good sex is going to be a very , very good level of magnitude .
of course , the five senses are not the only thing that makes life interesting .
we are all born as artists .
if you have a conversation that &apos;s going to come up with the next answer to the next answer , the child has come to the face of what it has started .
but your parents tell you , &quot; it &apos;s going to be suspended all of the waves . &quot;
but kids normally make art fun . it &apos;s play .
but you rarely find a teacher .
in the blink of the world , people are always singing , &quot; the &quot; hotel &apos;s little , &quot; or &quot; hotel &quot; in the classroom , as they &apos;re sweating .
in this minute , we can turn the tv off . it &apos;s a little bit of the time , and they &apos;re on the internet , and they &apos;re going to do something .
the students fall in a kind of trance .
he said it was his profile . &quot; and what are you ? &quot; i said , &quot; actor , &quot; he said .
let &apos;s start with that point .
it will give more powerful storms and greater flooding .
if you &apos;re , it &apos;s a warming in the future .
but the second time , the very expectations are the expectations .
the economic implications are almost inconceivable .
a big part of the species will be threatened by extinction .
now , when you go to a car accident , it &apos;s critical that we don &apos;t just make the stunt , but the crew .
so , for this one , otherwise , it was used to be more and more like that , which was what you had .
but today we &apos;re using a nuclear flu .
more it is not a fair one .
in 1960 , joseph had had an air force of the united states force force .
one of the problems that you &apos;re doing in this altitude , if you go to 10,000 feet -- this is great , right ? if you &apos;re on 10,000 , you can actually use oxygen .
and they created a puppet for him , just like this , and it looked like it was .
we expect and others that maybe the execution or the most , you know , will be , &quot; you have to put somebody in a suit that &apos;s not filled up with the plane , which is connected to the plane . &quot;
there were three main pieces -- right ? -- that &apos;s the conference that &apos;s important to go to the conference , which i want to talk about .
and the girl replied , &quot; you know , you know . &quot;
the problem is to stay in a performer while you &apos;re growing up . i &apos;m convinced that we don &apos;t grow in creativity , but we &apos;re actually going to be in the process . or we &apos;re going to be more inclusive .
all over the world .
the whole system was invented -- all over the world , there was no public education system before the 19th century .
the brain is not divided into areas .
they did ballet , they made a ballet , and jazz , they were dancing modern dances .
the festival goes to how very good . with a very good press for you to die .
let &apos;s just say value for the current .
in dubai , for me , the way that i &apos;m going to support the things that are going to get the things in the gang .
before i want to return to the middle east , i &apos;d like to close as a centrifuge with a quote of one of the greatest most popular .
it &apos;s also the most sophisticated .
well , you &apos;re a disorder of behavior , and you &apos;re an act of the mind .
we don &apos;t all have facts . we don &apos;t even know what tools are going to be , or what we need to look for in the world to be able to get into the order of the different behavior .
how are you going to scale it up ? &quot;
the three are all the same , although they &apos;re all in different context , one is magical , the other two are like doing this books , because they have something very special about themselves .
the kids taught them to do it .
they were very friendly .
we also believe that the content is more important .
i was changing by my kids .
howard makes this experiment and when he gets the data , he draws a curve , and suddenly he recognizes that no beautiful thing is making .
this was his malibu . he was obsessed with it .
howard doesn &apos;t believe there &apos;s all these at all .
and that &apos;s always the people who say they &apos;re going to ask their coffee .
mustard with more elegance and culture and meaning .
so it was . and why did we love that ?
he was a few times more disturbing , and spent most of his career in the lower zoo , and then he ended up with management managers , and he was the general manager of the oakland a .
we all know what happened when millions of women have been given over decades to symptoms of the internet , until we have a huge study , depending on the national government , found , found , found , found , found , found , found .
thank you .
but dad was a scary and he didn &apos;t want us to do that .
but there &apos;s also a blue area in between .
these are four really different ways to see the world . i named it named .
what &apos;s interesting , once you get it -- and -- by the way -- this is from 1904 -- show all the artifacts of modern comics : the most powerful line of the story without a little bit of the left line , and a more painful from the
and that was what i proposed : we might be able to do comics on an infinite canvas : on the edge and on the y-axis and in the line of town .
this is from daniel atwood in britain .
maybe you &apos;ve all been clear about all of this , but for me , so often i &apos;ve been going to have this difficulty , i &apos;ve never seen this very difficult a day , i &apos;ve never seen this .
this is honestly , and the reason , and the reason , and the reason , is that , in the case , 18,000 representation is such a sustainable impression .
if you believe your baby is gay , or a lesbian , you should be able to get it off to the adoption .
so , political solutions was the citizens of texas , to pray for rain .
this song is called &quot; the sun &apos;s book . &quot;
i want to start something different tonight , because i want to ask you to jump to the mainland , and to jump to the open ocean .
they were starting to start out of the road , and they were going to be a hundred million years ago , when whales had legs , and they came out of a plastic company , and they made me look at this imaginary , which is a new york
and how do you do that ?
the california cylinder takes the molas when they come into the bay , they &apos;re going to break them up , they turn them into a kind of a kind of a design , and then they put them around .
i &apos;ll show you the last data data .
and the most exciting thing was that all of their love and their interest are in the oceans .
so you can see here , this is a circuit circuit .
this is what you don &apos;t hear every day .
so ha ha .
in australia , it &apos;s mostly the aboriginal people sitting in jail .
she told him , and he asked the first ted community to talk about what we call the &quot; the world . &quot;
because nobody gets a nuclear prize .
so why don &apos;t we do something about this problem in the everyday life ?
goodbye mahatma gandhi .
could i get my last track ?
never , that &apos;s impossible ! no , no , no ! this isn &apos;t possible . &quot;
you could do it all the essence .
von neumann , a man , and a mathematician of the army took everything together . then they needed a room to build them .
and it worked on and copy of the first time .
&quot; aha ! &quot; finally , they found that it was a plastic accident .
i know if i got to give myself a beat . &quot;
he made the machine run all night , if someone remembered stephen wolfram , who was still invented the whole thing .
now , we &apos;re going to sit here for 50 years later -- it &apos;s a kind of force of law animation .
sadly , in the next 18 minutes i &apos;m talking about here , four americans who are still alive , die of their diet .
this is a global problem .
it &apos;s full of city .
and he &apos;s got the wool full of it . it &apos;s sorry to be his friends , his family and his community .
they want ... they want to control themselves .
you know , for long , long time at this very tight understanding , it &apos;s been left .
we don &apos;t teach our children .
and most kids get them .
well , supermarkets .
if you can cook , it doesn &apos;t matter .
in all america , many wonderful things go , if we just look back now .
misha glenny : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen -- a clever group politically popular hackers that 2011 .
the net connects everything and is going to be very soon a lot of human activity .
interestingly , anonymous uses the information of the information , but not for financial profits .
he explained to me how he went in in new york in 2003 , and he went to new york , and he took 10,000 dollars from the atm machines here , 30,000 dollars from the atm machines .
he was born in a stable and respect in a stable and respect family , his obsession with play as adolescents .
and most of them , except by script and the most , really , showed no real social skills in the outside world -- only in the net .
i think there &apos;s several reasons . i &apos;m not going to go to the details , but some mention .
but they &apos;re all the market . and what the market is driving is especially -- number one is the big demographic group of cancer .
we also found a lot of examples for dead big boxes that have been transformed in all kinds of social institutions , many schools , many churches , many churches , and many libraries , like this one .
and finally , i expect the streets to expand through the top of the mall .
it &apos;s very successful . and it has helped be a nurturing that eight of 13 local fires have been in denver , to become a more prolific model .
the stream was covered by the parking lot .
their citizens are very typical of the world &apos;s typical , but they &apos;re less vulnerable than cities .
&quot; his vagina to look at , &quot; she said , &quot; is a whole of the whole computer . &quot;
but actually , it didn &apos;t start there , it started with a conversation with a woman .
it &apos;s a gender that is a fundamental resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a key , and the way that it really exists in the body , and i think there &apos;s a real meaning in our bodies , our bodies of our head -- that this separation has created a division of intervention that &apos;s often done .
i want to tell you this little story about my own beginnings , because it &apos;s very strong with happiness , and with agnes .
maybe it &apos;s on my favorite south carolina , which is not much smaller than this today , and once of a future as an independent country .
well , maybe he was too loving , because he stayed where he was , even for the beating , and even after the police and the rescue and the rescue and the rescue in budapest .
and he got the same answer : &quot; bring me the best workers you can find and if you &apos;re good enough , i &apos;ll give you a . &quot;
and so , it &apos;s like , &quot; it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s all so beautiful .
&quot; aha ! &quot; said dr. robicsek . &quot; i &apos;m alone in the movie . &quot;
as i said , he was a lot of the time .
and you can imagine it right .
you know what they &apos;re looking for .
but we &apos;re taking care of the most difficult cases and order to get the other day .
so we came to these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother went to the period of the soviet union .
and if you think it &apos;s not going to be , it &apos;s going to push it so long until you go .
what i want to do with this -- i hope to show these dots .
and what i &apos;d like to suggest later in the presentation , 50 percent of the u.s. is under the ocean .
it &apos;s there , because photons can &apos;t reach the average depth of the ocean , which is the equivalent of the sky , the rift mile is on the ground .
and so we went along the mountain ridge in a field next to the ice center , and i found the missing heat .
so i started to develop a new design machine , with a computer company that replaced me , and i don &apos;t have to go into my vehicle .
we find the heart of the conservation .
and i looked at them yesterday , she &apos;s up in seattle . ok .
but i would leave a child without a driver &apos;s control .
in some parts of the world , for example , in south africa , education is hard to be available .
when we saw the impact of the position , andrew and i decided that we had to increase it to the best people like possible to offer the best education .
what was the special thing about these courses ?
the video is interrupted every few minutes and the students will ask a question .
so we wanted to convince some of our colleagues to be the humanities that several choices are not so bad .
in terms of particular courses , you can ask yourself what the most frequently believers are and how you can help the students to fix this .
we even see the beginning of either of a personalized curriculum or through the feedback of feedback , that we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe , and what my first thought was , what was the kind of infinity , when i was still a child .
and in our society , of course , it &apos;s mostly about being able to make the reality of other people .
i have this kind of doubt about the values of newton &apos;s science , like , for example , that it &apos;s expected to be rational in a corporate game .
so you can understand my surprise , when i read in the new yorker , that alan greenspan , the chief of the federal reserve , said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer &apos;s chief of the official attack . &quot;
i think you can do it over the funny , which is not about the ones who don &apos;t have . right from this reason , i &apos;m not even a jokes of 350,000 and a bit of a sudden .
i &apos;m going to do this very old times of the most old time , i &apos;m going to tell you .
he said , i &apos;d have to pay for him more respect because it could take to 18 years to be a really good job .
huh ? yes ? what ? i don &apos;t hear them .
and i &apos;m afraid that this active one may not be us .
i thought about xml , who was thinking about beauty yesterday , and there &apos;s a piece of printing in his book , saying that the trickster can make beauty sometimes .
george w. bush : what the defense of our security costs also , and what the defense costs of our freedom also costs , we need to pay the price . &quot;
ten years ago , no astronomer would come on the world -- well , or very few astronomers -- that there are planets outside of our solar system .
many other ecosystems on earth are truly in danger .
he &apos;s constantly making it that an experiment with an particle accelerator could be wrong and an oven that &apos;s destroyed the world .
we have to let the same approval update for biotechnology .
so , of course , we don &apos;t want to see .
what can we do about this ?
and now the worst is coming .
we use a lot of money on it , make sure we don &apos;t die at a time of dying , but we &apos;re almost not giving out anything . and yet it &apos;s totally preventable .
we don &apos;t want to get caught on the wrong foot .
i hope that &apos;s going to be .
this is very , very important , because this is the system that the intangible , from the life , came out of the planet , and it &apos;s now time to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing insight . and we &apos;ve only been talking about it for recently .
and this is what the system is doing , a number of places in the southern hemisphere , shown in these circles .
everybody who &apos;s later coming up to the database , just can get the information on the database , and it &apos;s the information that &apos;s needed for everything .
we &apos;re on the end of the wave , the transition , the technological possibilities .
in a single earthquake , big amounts of these new microbes that we never saw before , looked out of the sea floor .
the most popular john john &apos;s network creates a network of the solar cameras and sensors that make our oceans to global , interactive lab -- and a key thing about the world of the deep .
so i think optimism is driving architecture forward .
so again , radical versus conservative .
the most obvious thing about the most obvious thing . you know , too often you want to understand everything .
our intellectual desires are complex .
you know , it &apos;s true ; the cathedrals , as unexpected , will always be unexpected .
but i rather do play something rather unknown , and even with mistakes , rather than repeat the same thing , so it &apos;s from his insignificance .
risks from rooms still have never been so much more than that in a groundbreaking city .
there &apos;s the emotions of victims .
daniel libeskind builds up very large ideas , which is called 17 grade stories that are to basically be a real vision of architecture -- raw , predictable , more powerful , radical -- and inspiration for every bold creative pursuit .
it also has the lowest carbon rate of all the cars .
does something really matter , or will it only give you a few more sophisticated types of control ?
em : it just has to be . if not , we &apos;re in big trouble .
with this capital , and it &apos;s installed solarcity , and then it &apos;s called the panels on the roof and then it &apos;s a monthly prize , which is lower than the nuclear bill , which is lower than the nuclear bill .
we failed , but we &apos;ve been in 2008 about it .
it &apos;s similar to a jet jet .
how about all the world &apos;s world , is it true to be a person ?
look at this .
boy , if you &apos;re eating our livestock , and a cheetahs like this , he &apos;s eating one of our goats , it &apos;s very nervous . then just go to him .
we suffered hunger .
our tradition looks like this : in every single way , there &apos;s a holy fire .
and then we were able to get support of the world wildlife fund in the world , which is to increase very small programs with the more powerful possible programs .
very important -- we invest the money in enlightenment about aids and hiv .
so , the time of the world &apos;s -- again , a lot of the world &apos;s time in the world -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful means .
and we hide this price behind huge winning .
dan spielberg and alice klein &apos;s leading the torah revolution for the educational revolution .
and the water , shells , oysters , oysters , the water , the water , the most famous species -- these were the known species .
this is a beginner of protein .
science is looking at the world through the mind , in quantitative , things that can be measured and described , but there &apos;s the art of knowledge for knowledge and insight .
from a few cameras , a plan of a couple of cameras was a plan with 25 degrees of paper .
this is the natural cycle .
and that would not usually do a photographer , a photograph that &apos;s like to be able to get a picture , right ? but sometimes it &apos;s got to be to show the dimensions .
here you see the glacier moving back .
this is several cameras seen .
could india be the origin or a global center for innovation , just as it became a global center for the world &apos;s center and the most effective ?
when we asked people in conversation with people in these twin centers , they said , &quot; we work on global products . &quot;
you can &apos;t be a professor , if you weren &apos;t a student .
the best hospitals , in the doctors for cancer treatments , would be going to be as , and at ada , heart disease , heart disease , for artificial sustainability , they &apos;re advising four a.m.
it works a little bit like -- this is a recently recently , very recently , a double video problem .
i said , i know a very promising message when i see a very rapid message .
every one of our society comes with cancer in touch -- if not personal , then by a beloved people , a member of a family member , a friend , a friend .
in this space space , the genetic material is the chromosomes , within a nucleus .
we &apos;ve applied tumor fields in the lab over 20 different cancers , and we see this effect at all .
he got the most educated .
but what we can see is that in sixth month of the tumor , it &apos;s responding to the tumor and it starts to get back .
this is just the beginning .
this is a new cubicle , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re 15 feet deep , collect rainwater from the roof , there &apos;s a little pipe , and from their courtyard .
so , water from 300 , 400 kilometers away , it &apos;s going to look like this .
somewhere , a stream or a glass system through this scene .
this is called &quot; metastases . &quot; in english , we have a lot of time and water ground .
and you have to go down .
these are the beautiful stairs that we just saw on one of the images .
and the other thing is , it &apos;s 27 percent down : 600,000 fewer people per year , hiv in sub-saharan africa .
10 percent of india .
they will get the jobs in textiles , which people get out of the front of the world and bring them to the industrialization and bring them into the way in the fossil and prosperity .
and the countries on the right , there you see the most important thing , and basically every country has a little bit of a time , we say , less than 5,000 dollars , a more powerful of saying , we &apos;re three .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india grew up not so much .
buy african products .
but i think a lot of the problem is that this logic -- that we should not drop ipods and not to drop ipods -- i mean , it would be a great title for thomas &apos;s book .
and then 500 people have chosen to get up and have been chosen to visit the institution , and so they &apos;ve chosen to go to the institution and so they &apos;re to be blogging to be blogging .
so now , in the planning of the planning , the planning of the planning is not necessarily going to change anything , because it &apos;s still the dictators that control the agenda .
so , the internet &apos;s most important thing : is the internet &apos;s worst expectations ?
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he was standing with us younger fellows .
because for me , the time in this time , and in this particular period , the question was , &quot; you want to ? &quot; you want to do it , &quot; you &apos;re going to do it , &quot; or drugs -- and drugs , and we didn
i was paralyzed , people .
as indians , and also politicians and security , i &apos;m pretty much about the most sophisticated , which is our country , concerned about all the talk about india as a new , new superpower , even the new superpower .
in other words , all sorts of things tell us about countries , regardless of the other , whether they want to get the odds , whether they want to go to the daylight or not .
but the flash of the country at the time , it took quite slowly , it took about half an hour to the same one of an hour .
you can &apos;t understand the nodes .
this can sometimes have an unethical consequences . ok .
and these of you who have this money , you might be surprised to see how many people are sitting on the top of the planet , which explains the most important thing .
i went home and i was doing a little bit of research , and i found some scary statistics .
so , the storyline of water : a bath without water .
and now i feel like george bush .
now this title , this phrase comes from a critic , an early critic and this is a passage that i just love , and i &apos;d like to read them .
and that &apos;s a good thing , because if it would be , does mother nature have a problem : how to get chimpanzees to mate ?
this is the hardest part , which is not obvious . and so i &apos;ve got it for the conclusion .
ok ? stop . that won &apos;t be .
i don &apos;t know why there are a lot of the time that &apos;s going on , but they &apos;re there in the garden .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
i actually suspect that the most likely time the most important reason we &apos;re going to know , why we want to be very , very quickly , really want to verify .
it &apos;s like this . you should see that .
bob mckim has a different one -- another version of this exercise in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned that with time : you get a much better randomized , much more creative results when all of you are holding the rules .
and suddenly , there was a productive conversation about design about a real object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little bit skeptical , i &apos;ll come back to it .
you know how it feels like all of these uncertainty , as long as you go back in the corridor , as long as the doctors are going to take care of a little bit of the time and ask , what &apos;s going on here ?
so we would all feel sure and we would have a good time because we agree about the rules and we agreed with the rules .
we do everything that leads to success , but then , if we &apos;re there , we think we &apos;ve done it . we &apos;re satisfied back and we just stop doing all of that , all of us who have made us successful .
i was faster , but as depressed as depressed .
i learned that success is not a one-way street .
and the main world is just full of hot girls . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh my god , &quot; -- hopefully , for the last time in public .
he made sure all together .
it took 900 people to do it .
and the second is that people are actually experiencing a real connection .
these are questions .
as you see in modern liberal democracies , society is not just to determine us , our own selves , to shape ourselves , but to shape it also , but it also demands it .
it means that we &apos;re going to fulfill our full potential as human beings .
so these are the layers that are kind of asking , through the way i wanted to run them today -- the question : what are the intentions that come to use if they design something ?
so i said , and my colleague sebastian thrun , that it has to give us better ways .
and we were successful .
i &apos;m going to give one in the fall .
he &apos;s going to be able to go into the right position , and it &apos;s going to be with his nose and beat it .
we learned the first surprise .
it had to give you a kind of a kind of a design test to create the amount of power and the speed that we observe and the speed of the system .
a load load measures , and it &apos;s actually a kind of a cell load load cell in the inside .
this is the most salient -- here &apos;s the heel , and that &apos;s going to turn around and hit on the load cell .
a very , very , very , very basic solution to the special problem .
and manuscripts : it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean .
i think that &apos;s one of the most beautiful classical music things ever been built .
i don &apos;t know any other marketing of other people , not even the ones that are just benefit from that , that this is a three-dimensional space .
now , you see that -- just let me stand .
the submarine , last year , was this one .
the way that we have architecture is the understanding of architecture as a function of architecture , and , please , excuse me to be the obvious example -- is not the right approach we need to choose .
basically , new york was built on the back of the mountain of the mountain , our streets over their shells .
in those eight side zones , small amounts of chambers are put in little bits of space .
so you walk around in london , and it was overwhelmed by this smell .
finally , snow created a map of the outbreak .
and that &apos;s what happens every week .
i made her portrait on the top of the temple .
and in this area of the amazon , in the 1930s , it was discovered in the 1930s .
the other side of the field is a lexicon , where actually osama laden is supposed to be a store . that &apos;s a little bit of a time .
this was one of the great things .
this is the most important thing . let me move and show you the hubble center of the deep field .
but then you get to jupiter and the one is 40 minutes away . that &apos;s a problem .
this is going to be part of the way that it &apos;s going to understand the beginning of the universe .
we only have a million galaxies .
so this stuff is the stuff that seems to be white , dark matter .
when you saw this picture for the first time , you don &apos;t see much in it .
this simulation was made for 1,000 processors a month , just to just make this visible here .
with the most primitive hope we have a resolution that is about this image of the earth , which is actually where you can actually recognize the complicated patterns of the earth .
and in the consequence , we &apos;re stressed .
47 percent .
this is crazy . we do that all the time , even in the day-to-day life .
i got into a vicious cycle . so many pain and problems with the joints , so i could almost nothing hold it .
so i asked myself , could you be creative if you look for the constraints ?
this is not happening for the morning .
the constant thing is , of course , is responsible , as well as a nuclear scientist , and there &apos;s a little bit of the damage to the environmental sector , and the persistent monitor of environmental degradation .
stalin &apos;s chan famine &apos; &apos; 30s , who killed the most , killed millions of people , in the &apos; 40s , and they saw the nazis , they were consuming the nazis , they were burnt , they were trafficked to germany .
because it &apos;s the grief . &quot;
and as a psychologist , i was excited most of the idea that we had learned what we were learning about in virtual world , and about our identity , to live a better life in the real world .
we used to be used to a new way of being together .
human relationships are blinking , chaotic and more colorful .
it &apos;s a little bit of time .
because at the moment , in the people alone , even for a few seconds , they will be more appreciative , scared , get panic , they get to a electronic device .
but we &apos;re in danger because in fact , the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently , we didn &apos;t have any of the most sophisticated , and we didn &apos;t have any of our students predicted , and quite often -- quite often , i felt that they had been awarded to the financial form of a living way .
maybe because of the father , we &apos;ve been reading my father .
so i did it in quiet -- but pretty well , and i was going to be a nice thing to do it .
and finally , i thought , i &apos;m going to have a pyramid , but i &apos;m missing the time to take a closer way .
although you lose , not fear of failure , if we &apos;ve got it all , because who can have more desire to give people more than anything that he &apos;s doing .
if i want to call names , i never know about it .
did i have enough security ?
the second challenge would be cells .
today , in many clinical trials , different species of stem cells are used for heart disease .
it &apos;s only last month we &apos;ve managed to do this technology that &apos;s creating human health skills .
we can map them and turn to 360 degrees and analyze the kidney in all their sausages , and then we can just take this information and print it by the air , and print it by the air .
i couldn &apos;t even stand at school . i just went dirty .
i was a kid , i said , &quot; yes , that &apos;s what i want . i want this surgery .
you may notice that a new area is called the coalition of the city .
and connected to this kind of thing , there was examples of the world around the world -- from the election of a president to the west coast , and everything in between -- the demonstrated of a lot of the things that could do .
third , more energetic , progressive environmental problems .
because what you need is the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want a cd , i want to do the music that you play .
i &apos;m a club , and i &apos;m a member member in kenya .
we need to have our women and children , we need to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve the infrastructure .
late in the night , i went home with batteries and ice .
together : did anybody have a coach ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , to give up the master , to go to moscow and work in working in working with this .
and that can be huge spending , but if the city can win a number of x volunteers for y hours , the most important thing about the city of the city is the city of the city .
they have a little bit of the data , tables and data .
so , these are , in the 18 minutes , that have been offered to me to talk to you here , between two and a half people who are going to go to cities .
and he was in a corporate hotel called mud mud .
the buildings here have several stories .
these green things are in the foreground of mangoes .
and if you &apos;re an legal system , you have political activity .
i couldn &apos;t realize that i would be part of a technological revolution that would be true to this dream .
think about it . these men who didn &apos;t have the same thing as i had helped me through their full-time support , more athlete in law .
and then , in the back of the day , the only thing was called a computer bank , but by using a laser company , and he used a design company , he could develop a machine that could read every single one of the patients .
but you know , i think i &apos;m very lonely to read from machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books about the border , in the different english department countries , in the different english department , the u.k. , united states , canada , and the new zealand , and new zealand , and new zealand , had all different
the most powerful . life expectancy has been doubling since meetup , and it &apos;s increasing with a speed of five hours a day .
another thing . you want to do it , you know , people like me , okay ?
secondly , the new machine machine is so good news , because , as soon as the androids take work , we don &apos;t have to do that anymore and that &apos;s saved us and we &apos;re going to be more restrained .
the social challenges because of these inequality should be aware of attention .
the economic game is surprising , and surprisingly straightforward , especially in the short way .
and my biggest concern is that we create a world with a technology technology , embedded in a slightly more fundamental society , and supported by a economy that inequality rather than possibilities .
i started to feel more powerful in the course of god , and i was going to feel more honest with this notion of god .
some have a lot of the time that we can only believe in a god that &apos;s going to share our pain .
in the second phase , the line comes out , &quot; wind and waves obey him . &quot;
so who is god , if not the big news or the computer , or the most powerful ?
the beloved soul of the universe .
by looking for the god in the stream , by looking at my own inwardness .
one of the first things i started to explore was the story of the design project .
we &apos;ve never found a lot of science that was older than 40 years , and the average age of this predator and the chief of tribes is 20 to 30 .
our bodies have been used to this new diet .
so this equality of energy and matter , which einstein has shown and also shows the modern science of the world &apos;s dna , the entropy and information and energy and energy and energy all together , so it &apos;s a long continuum .
this is a robot that wants to stick your own plug to your own stream .
and what i mean to do is to look for her a new job .
a great development that has started billions of years ago , moving through us and move on . and our choice is kind of in technology , is really in the technology , is really in the process of doing that , that &apos;s much more powerful than we are
and they said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got five to 40 students .
we did all this down , and we found beautiful , white bars , and it had this -- while we said , &quot; you know what , it looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
so we waited , we sat at the tables and we waited .
there &apos;s a lot of the main problem . the only problem , especially for the adults who worked in hydrocarbons , who didn &apos;t really know that they were really , that they were just a toilet .
the teachers we work with -- everything is different for teachers -- they &apos;re telling us what to do .
about 170 tutors , with them , worked with the book , and so it worked beautifully .
and right behind -- there &apos;s usually a little chain -- right behind it , you &apos;ve been taught to see children .
there &apos;s also these kind of things -- it &apos;s a shelf that you don &apos;t see when you &apos;re opening in the jungle , but it &apos;s opening up .
he &apos;s a little bit of a sudden . he &apos;s bringing his cousin .
it gives him an email , he &apos;s going to ask you to ask you to answer your question .
i was this girl .
eighty percent of refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s a page that thinks that peace is the end of the battle , and there &apos;s a side that thinks peace is the creation of schools and jobs .
she sent her kids to school -- a new home .
there &apos;s one , which is the manual for complete idiots , did you know that ?
on the cape on the cape , there &apos;s a street street , and we can drive all of this .
that &apos;s my baby . thank you very much .
he basically said , &quot; i designed everything . &quot;
and in a certain sense , i felt bad at that time .
so i came from this kind of complications .
and i found out that cheetos are very good at the point of time .
the most difficult thing about college is , so number 10 is difficult .
from all in a strange fashion room about the most odd , which is a window of being excited about the window , which was the street that was black in front of my house , and that white , white and white there was in the sun .
and i was reminded by the great presentation of karen armstrong , that religion really understood really , not with belief , but to do with behavior .
the most sophisticated , it has seen , geographically , the same size . it doesn &apos;t look like this , but it &apos;s exactly the same size as the united states , and it &apos;s just pulling up the same size of arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the developed world .
we can &apos;t wait to wait for the most , which had australia to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of our whole civilization .
a new appreciation of the design that we have through the assumption of these challenge .
before i show you a few pictures to highlight , i want to point out of this beautiful detail about the design of design and design .
rca is really an extraordinary school in this case .
we &apos;ve been discussing this morning with keith , that many scientists don &apos;t tend to show something beautiful in their talks , from fear , as a dumb , as a dumb , considered to be a dumb .
so here &apos;s a way of looking at the inner pressure that is already very interesting .
so that &apos;s what we &apos;re thinking more about that , what robots mean for us .
no . so i had to think a little bit a little sharper .
we did the same thing for iraq .
that was a challenge we had to ask as a physicist .
we can push it up . the forces are more than that , there &apos;s more from you , but they &apos;re weaker .
&quot; naturally seven &quot; a whole band of &quot; death . &quot;
and there are some employees in foundations that call this &quot; the &quot; s &quot; .
the idea of justice , which shows our lives and a sense of what &apos;s right in life is what &apos;s right in life , which is just in life , which is what we should do .
and as it is , he &apos;s a little bit of time during the training industry .
so every week , the most popular line would come back . &quot; god , you &apos;ve answered me again . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , an infection , one infection or an operation .
the muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- the name of the name .
we &apos;re treating them with a drug vaccine -- the -- the , frankly , in this kind of pain , is not very effective .
now you get a sense of this , as much as a lot of rock we &apos;re talking about here .
it was 1908 . it &apos;s not doing anything . so i can live .
i don &apos;t know if you can see it from the back line of at all . these are just stars .
in 2005 , nasa started a probe called deep impact , which one -- which was a part of a way of being in the core of a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , i said engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a more powerful and choosing , and we can change our future .
and i &apos;ve led to this time , the only independent , to be the only independent medium to be the only electronic medium of the country .
and i thought that the people were surviving and a great company would be , if the last one was , what was true was that it was right .
and at the end of the meeting , he says , look , it &apos;s not going to work , you &apos;ll never see your money again . but my foundation will be put 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test the idea .
and we said , this is okay , we &apos;re going to make you , you get us your business business plan , which actually made you .
look , we started in in east europe with our work , and we went to russia .
after a while , we opened a solar machine .
and we &apos;ve developed the idea of spending bonds , consumer bonds on the free press .
and you &apos;re organized to the funding , so that it doesn &apos;t have any more sophisticated , no blind , you have no longer running around .
so why does it work ? this is the question .
now , some call this a theory of everything .
a simple example is this : newton found the law of gravity , which works like a divided by the square of the beach of the ocean .
the more symmetry you have , the better you think , the simplicity and elegance .
one thing he thought was most of us today , but it was not , of course , that it was not , of course .
it doesn &apos;t matter to you the importance of knowing that they &apos;re going to follow the laws of law , and accidents .
but he was reading in every free moment he had , books .
by this ambition , he returned to the prison .
but when he was just in the process of putting his signature under the computer &apos;s office , his hand was deaf and shaking , because he had a thousand hands during a prison post .
not very surprising -- it was only three women under the white house in the white house .
but i have to say , the older i became , the more i understand what an incredible privilege was to be with this aging , and so many hours of a man spent so many hours .
and so like lincoln the story , all of the time went to the u.k. after the u.k.
i asked my father under tears , &quot; what can we do only ? &quot;
what the reason is that i &apos;m always grateful for this strange love to the story that allows me to spend a life in back to the past .
he had the temple and he had the temple .
this is the most important thing that this object is , the evidence that the jews were in babylon , after the entire year they were sitting in babylon , and who were crying in babylon , who were going to be crying at the rivers .
all of these are being respected by cyrus .
the cylinder cylinder is from the priests of the great world &apos;s monkey , marduk , written .
they all know what happened .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of people were living in iran living after tehran .
some of you know more about the living conditions , but you &apos;re still thinking that you &apos;re a kind of miserable evil .
the new york babies cried in the first few hours , but their needs were not satisfied and eventually they learned to get themselves to be more . within less days they were weary , and they were going to start to go into the air like all others .
a study shows that communication support 10 percent of a single cost of a single cost of energy costs , while it costs about 30 percent .
and that fascinated me , because i had almost spent my whole life on a camera .
you know , you know , very quickly , what you have to do is to find an answer .
it was a percentage of people there -- most of them and family .
we heard every single one .
but of course he never came . the explanation has never occurred .
and after many , many meetings i was excited that this man , sudhir , , a really one of my heroes , and mentors , has done it , and it &apos;s got , unicef , in the boat .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones who believed in peace and on his possibilities , etc . , etc . -- and they were going to be actually in reality .
we connect with the food system -- i met a little bit of the time , and i said , &quot; in london 2012 , it &apos;s about fireflies .
it &apos;s about your own business , to your business .
the biggest brains in the world should also be cognitively most common .
i went to the world &apos;s literature , but i could never find them .
there &apos;s just a big deal .
and amazingly , that &apos;s exactly what our ancestors were invented about 1.5 million years ago when they discovered the cooking .
the very simple ways for the most sophisticated conversations i did .
and i think i &apos;m just standing at the beginning .
but once the fight is fighting , the physical rehabilitation was exposed to .
behind him , a child , his son , red in the face of effort , his father .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
i spoke at the night with my boss in the headquarters , and i told them -- i told you , &quot; look , we &apos;re going to start with a few hours a day , just for some of them . &quot;
two groups of the world &apos;s population started fighting .
so i asked him , &quot; what is it ? &quot;
&quot; yeah , we need to increase the production of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
and it &apos;s not just the center of the center , but it &apos;s also in the houses of people .
and you should see me during a computer program .
and this hospital could have been able to afford to do that .
why ? because the way that i had been allowed to be banned .
but i learned something called a little bit of a time , which is that the leaders -- the state of the economy ghana -- was very bad , made the human economy , which was given our economy to the collapse of the collapse .
because i knew the state of the african continent for my children and their children would be important .
i &apos;m trying to do the experience that i had in swarthmore , to bring to africa .
is my time ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment from which one great society can rise within a generation .
you &apos;ll notice that he &apos;s going to be very similar to the most yellow ball -- the sun we draw as children .
in fact , that &apos;s something that half of you , more than half , will be familiar .
32 pills are the cerebellum .
you know . &quot;
and that &apos;s the messages they convey to them ?
because , in the bottom , the sponsors love it , and so it brings them to television all the time .
a professional health company who talks to dead , they don &apos;t get me ?
what is homeopathy ?
we &apos;d like to have some suggestions of people like how to get more educated , more educated and community authorities , so they do something .
thank you .
so the entire hospital is often going on over a generator .
it has to give something better . &quot;
but the user can control whether there &apos;s just electricity or not , because you can control the most sophisticated distribution on the ground , how much percent of oxygen you give you .
but we want to be sure that this is the most effective and the most secure device that we can provide to the hospitals .
the different species of writing in africa , the first one was the kind of thing that the script was showing , which is the kind of secret of a secret society in the prison center of the world &apos;s population .
anyway , until 1998 , when a computer named john rutan discovered in the front of the football center in the prison center in the wild in the 1900s to 1900 b.c. , centuries ago , centuries ago .
almost one fifth of greenhouse gases comes from livestock -- that &apos;s more than the traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and they &apos;re growing up to the line of animals and animals on the line of tools like tools , is not just okay .
and it was a in french .
a picture of fish would be better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t quite bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
some of us would be able to do my , maybe not so bad .
about a year ago , i asked myself , &quot; why am i , though , what am i knowing , what i know , not a vegetarian ? &quot;
on the weekend , you have the choice .
you can do a picture with an iphone , and all the names are , although sometimes it &apos;s still making mistakes .
they &apos;re going to be distracted . he &apos;s ultimately winning the race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would be able to figure out , it &apos;s about understanding more about it , if the leader is so high , but it &apos;s a very , very valid area .
or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a big artwork .
human nature must change .
but part of the reason -- and this is why we have a ethical level in the pursuit of what we have -- is that they &apos;re also sensitive .
it could be more complicated , but maybe not very .
jh : is it encouraging to play with these forces ?
and so i knew that i needed something to control .
so there &apos;s a lot of time , because there &apos;s a little bit of the dynamic behavior , because it &apos;s the dynamic behavior of liquid .
and so i think that you can be a little bit more inclusive .
this is a great assistant in the studio .
we take the pizza , our first pizza , and we break the individual slices , while the messenger is in the hallway and we &apos;re going to be tuned .
i was sure 20 before i first went into an art museum .
i thought , okay , you have some criteria like you want to choose the work .
it &apos;s not a photoshop .
they &apos;re interested in creating a novel , alternatives , and they needed money , so they decided to make some interesting fundraising projects .
this project is called &quot; the &quot; s . &quot;
and so we went to grave and we did this , it was hilarious -- the attention we got .
and she describes how the most important thing is -- everything you say is , of course , of the most violent anger .
he &apos;s a computer designer , and he &apos;s also a performer .
it &apos;s based on origami . so we go .
people used mathematical principles to understand the underlying principles .
or you take it on the top and you do 50 stars on a flag with 13 stripes .
how would you make a single flap ?
we &apos;ve found these rules that you put together with circles , you put it in the air , which is the extra rules that obey them . that makes the pattern .
you can do a lot of things .
but if you want to do it bigger , you could need something origami .
and that doesn &apos;t work whether you go into space or whether you go into a body .
i grew up in a corporate state of washington with a lot of free time in the state of washington .
we only have three minutes . but we &apos;re talking about it for hours .
and so i want to talk about that , because if we don &apos;t recognize it , this transformation is very painful .
and in a moment , i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;re going to see in the graph -- it starts in 1973 , just before the women start to slow up , and it goes to the day for today .
you were there , you know , you were up from the top .
because i write about all this a book , i still do it , and i don &apos;t have any answer .
and that was very daunting for them .
there &apos;s no way we &apos;ve got this information completely completely processed , and they come back to us in the form of culture , in this weird and more unequal way where they can see that the customization can change .
there &apos;s no man or no woman who stands in the middle and it &apos;s the wires to digitize .
and the personal income on a scale that has been kept over to take the inflation to the point of view , in this time , is almost doubling , almost doubling .
and to hear me and understand what i say , you &apos;ve already got about 60 bits per second .
it &apos;s still happening , so in the last book of me called &quot; good business &quot; i interviewed some ceo , which is very successful , and also very ethical , with great social sense of consciousness .
control is also a safe thing , because you &apos;re going to feel in your mind , but not really designed .
&quot; where are you born , grew up and went to school ? &quot;
because my grandparents were born , they had their own meaning for what home is , they had their meaning for community , and even for hostility which was given to them . they didn &apos;t really have the possibility to go beyond it .
more and more people are also embedded in the future or present , as in the past .
i went down into the room where i should sleep .
so , the question of the question is , where is it home ?
there was a big gap between one billion in the industrialized countries and the two billion in the developing world .
but this is the world that we have today , no gap .
and let me show you why , by the outset , digital technology is going to be a new technology .
the kids are the new green .
and again , they were better than we said , &quot; you british and your mortality rate in heart disease . &quot;
but if you have people , you don &apos;t change the high number of heart disease .
and i immediately started working with the work of work , and then they grew up , and then i worked with a little bit of work -- mice that couldn &apos;t produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my mother-in-law , and of course i don &apos;t know how old she is .
could be equally good at the equator in the summer .
certainly many advances , many of the things that live .
this is actually real photography , in the time , which shows that the limb is going to ruin within a few days .
and here you see what happened six months later , which is technically appropriate to the other .
a blood vessel consists of two different types of cell cell .
we then put it back into this oven-like device .
much more complex organs . with the very complex solid organs , the most complex solid organs are highly high , with every amount of blood flow , liver and kidney .
this is still in the field of office .
we prefer cells that are not going to be repeated and not going to make tumors .
we just need five seconds .
for every problem out there , anybody would have an idea .
so , i &apos;m just a little bit of panic -- unlike all the irrational and sugar , i had -- but this is a entrepreneur really really really incredibly interesting .
that doesn &apos;t mean you have to visit a car game .
i went from door to door and sold license plate .
it &apos;s like a recession . so there &apos;s a recession .
and you would make these chairs .
this is pointless . &quot; you have to get a way to get to money faster .
i sold lots of evangelical forums .
they don &apos;t get regular income , but they have the possibility to find more tasks and they learn to learn the ability to find the capacity , and they also learn to find more possibilities .
if you go into a restaurant and you &apos;re going to be doing bad , you &apos;ll show you how bad sexual protection is .
these young , luxembourg .
the development of today is , all the interests , but to throw the interests on a ship .
the most important thing about the computer &apos;s dna or a computer designer of cultural logging is most of our students .
the values of the past are also being deceived , and that &apos;s bringing a lot of society .
but it &apos;s a politics of principles , not the most important .
they have a mind . and they have other people .
what we should be concerned about when we think about conservatives -- except the 1980s , the 1980s -- what &apos;s going on is : they go to church .
clearly , i know you don &apos;t really believe me .
and that doesn &apos;t just lead to another outcome , it has the potential to change how we deal with each other .
completely different .
in fact , that &apos;s not a rights organization , but clear -- let me finish this -- creative commons offers authors a simple way to give their content to the freedoms with the freedoms that they want to leave them .
john mccain .
and i wonder how often this happened .
he told me that he &apos;s the most prolific and then said , &quot; there &apos;s a snake in the next room , and we &apos;re going to be there now . &quot;
so , for today , i had the idea that i &apos;m going to run them through this process and show them how this journey looks like .
and the hospital and general electric were also happy .
i survived just with that .
i &apos;m going to always ask people , &quot; is it really possible to use these microbial ecosystems to our advantage ? &quot;
another possibility , how microbes can spread from people , and architects put spaces similar to similar gestures to bring the human interaction or exchange to create ideas in such a form of terms and offices .
imagine a design that takes to take place the microbes , for example , in an airplane or on a phone .
and nobody knew about it .
my company , the design , built a system called ownership performance for the apple macintosh .
in 1992 , his essay was rejected by the u.s.
and greenpeace wanted to do this , and a way to do that was to be a , of one of these humpback whales , a kind of a plastic plant .
in 78 percent of voices , to give you an idea of the most important victory : led two to the most prolific , only three percent of the voices were only three percent .
and the last message i want to share with you is : you can be pretty successful online .
i think i don &apos;t need to explain what a big privilege is , today , to stand today .
this is the school that was built with the community .
something that we have in gando are the things that we have .
just like that .
good morning . magic is a brilliant way to be ahead to be the most prolific , to make the world possible , which is really going to be able to make science tomorrow .
there are color red and the color black , they &apos;re going to move to night from the end of day .
voice : why not ? this is a very good piece .
this is an illusion .
so this is china , a civilization-state , and not so much a nation-state .
but you can &apos;t lead a country like china , a civilization-state on the basis of a civilization , a system .
and the reason is , first of all , the state in china gets a very special -- a very special amount of value than the representative , the embodiment and the anchor of chinese civilization , the world &apos;s most , the most prolific civilization .
he was in the 17th kilometers long kilometers , and it was a shanghai age .
we &apos;ve seen this in terms of the census -- the position of the brain &apos;s position quickly , and the dotted .
he &apos;s going to be on tracks a road on the ground , and the cars drive below .
red = drums blue bass blue = split the bass , purple , blue dependencies , which is purple , is the most prolific internet effect .
and the first song was on english , the second was chinese .
she agreed to her song .
i made graffiti , i wrote my name everywhere , used the city as canvas .
i mean , these were the faces of my friends .
they all accepted that their image would be packed next to each other .
&quot; you mean , you &apos;re a little person &apos;s face -- that &apos;s a face , right here ? &quot;
and most places i went to , i decided to go because i heard about them in the media .
i took more pictures and we launched the project .
are you an ngo ? are you from the media ? &quot;
so the roofs were controlled , a woman , &quot; now god can see me . &quot;

goliath is easy prey . he doesn &apos;t have a chance .
so , goliath is the length of the time to the time , and normally there &apos;s an explanation for if someone is so far outside of the norm .
and i think that there &apos;s a very important lesson for all of us .
and it turns out that we &apos;re covered by a computer , and these microbes are often doing well , rather than killing us .
they all have the microbes and the people used to put into the recipient .
most pills , or the most sophisticated , you can eat , contain one or two , maybe five species , and the human community has thousands of species of species .
we need a key for the microbes that live in and on people , so we can understand what they &apos;re doing .
so many people think about the internet , very much on the english , but for us it &apos;s truly global . we have it in many , many languages .

so dolphins can be able to get out of the distance and tickle themselves from the distance .
look at how they are with their partner and the other of their own .
but we found that it &apos;s not easy to make that free dolphins don &apos;t just depend on a keyboard in a keyboard .
this dolphin called &quot; the &quot; s &quot; , because it &apos;s about 12 of the people who are about 12 years old .

because this event was the scientific revolution since the world &apos;s physical world , and how we can adapt it to our needs , and we can see it in the process of what we need .
by the way , why don &apos;t we do that ?
your work on consideration is our point . &quot;

this is a piece of ice , it &apos;s 12 years old .
i &apos;m going to show you images today from the internet , and i &apos;m going to show you , and the polar bear and polar seals , and this picture is a lot of time to me , but this picture is more than any other i &apos;ve ever
people were saying , &quot; we knew they were malignant . we knew it . &quot;

and i &apos;ll tell you more about it , but just ...
but he also made a different person here , who was doing the same thing as he did .
this is &quot; the &quot; s . &quot;

there &apos;s the glamour of physics .
and indeed , we see these miniature photographs of stars that all the time -- they call them a little bit of time .

stairs , the one who &apos;s made the hidden winds , are glamorous .
but it &apos;s going to give you the illusion that if you buy this lamp , you will live in a world without wires .
the perfect thing -- it &apos;s a perfect thing , which is the perfect chain , with the perfect glass .
because glamour can be very reluctant and deceptively .
but i also knew how hard she worked all week .

and norway , sweden , denmark and finland are under the six of the world &apos;s countries and working hours , where the average americans would cry in front of heart .
but the new idea that &apos;s the revolutionary idea of the most powerful idea is that there &apos;s something like &quot; good slow . &quot;

i worked months of it , and i didn &apos;t work with it because i felt that people who came from the historical museum , are already linked to information , and if they saw a museum with information , they wouldn &apos;t process that anymore .
when i went home , the most amazing was planned .
but you see the uniqueness of the environment .
moshe sung : building the uniqueness of outrageous
and if christian played a note -- play for example .
so in jazz , the most amazing thing is the most amazing thing .
it &apos;s not about that , my vision , or something .

they had to get a lot of consistency to here .
in the summer , india is going to be extremely hot .
and the adult animal , which is then coming up , is still a or two months .
and then i didn &apos;t know , but i know it today . this is hundreds of species of water .
this was a little curious about me , and i &apos;m going to hear you here , because i want to ask you , and here &apos;s a lot of people who have -- of course , people who have spent their childhood here .
so , next i got to the phone .
october , november , december . this is not the time of the northeast monsoon .
okay , they put their eggs at the time of the seasonal rains while the most seasonal .
last week , it &apos;s got a lot of time . the most powerful thing , and now it rains it .
a pretty incredible amount of light .
incredible . this is the most important thing about a nuclear being at all . a pretty incredible approach .
i made this out of my life .
and everybody thought , i would be good . but on the new terrain , i was terrible . people said , &quot; oh , he &apos;s -- oh , what happened to the inmates ? &quot;
and in front of my surgery , i looked at them and i asked myself , &quot; how do i do that ? &quot;
next -- oh , look , i think , these guys are the community .
so i was pretty successful . and if you &apos;ve done all this , what is it to drive one another ? i &apos;ve told you about the most important and other things , but what does one do ?
my last tedtalk , about seven years ago , about seven years ago .
but carl norden really has cracked the code .

i &apos;ve described the opposite of a success story .
a walk in a city or a kind of journey shows this diversity of human species in amazing ways .
we ask the human ancestry .
but what data is the statements ?
imagine that you have to be a compelling .
it was an african , which is based on the global diversity of the world &apos;s population .
the sahara was much bigger than today .
people who are engaged in killing animals that they put in the most sophisticated store , moved north and followed for about 45,000 years ago in the midwest in the middle east in a rare phase phase of the sahara .
the human genome , the genome project on mars .
we know deep in our hearts that the universe doesn &apos;t move from the mush to complexity .
so there we go .
what you see here , the blue areas are cooler , as the red areas are , in the red areas .
the smaller distances than gravity works , which explains why why they and i are smaller than the stars and planets .
they &apos;re familiar with the double helix of dna .
let me explain why .
in the last 200 years , something else happened .
now , maybe you ask yourself , &quot; what &apos;s the talk ? &quot;
we &apos;re not so good if it comes to insurance companies .
and then you have to decide how to invest in your 52 choices , and you &apos;ve never heard of a plastic company .
at least a wonderful study has predicted this .
but if you get the driver &apos;s license , you cross the box when you don &apos;t want to give the organs .
the other group gets two apples , one is taken .
save more tomorrow , just make it .
this is just one example .
it &apos;s a song about a so-called called the &quot; a creature that mimics a creature that is imitating a creature . &quot;
hello , who is there , please ?
thank you .
and that &apos;s a lot of influence to the experience of life .
i &apos;m trying to get time to go .
so what did i do ?
we invent stories to explain our existence .
so what did they do ? they sent their walter raleigh to separate their human part of their divine part of their divine part .
you &apos;ve been looking at a child ?
elizabeth : get out ! get out ! get out !
i went to a friend of mine and he left me waiting for his apartment in the morning in the 1900s in the 20th hill , a really rich area in mumbai .
everything is a contradiction .
we have lived from less than a dollar a day -- about 15 years .
and you have to use nuts from the rainforests to show that forests is more worth than the forest is more worth than a car . &quot;
he said , &quot; you can &apos;t wake up a person who says to sleep . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about people ; it &apos;s about life quality .
if you &apos;re a limited planet , if you &apos;re going to be sustainable , how can we achieve this ?
coke has to work with pepsi .
these are nine of them .
at the end of the time , i think , 60 percent of the world &apos;s production , and 25 percent of the world &apos;s population .
that &apos;s not irrelevant .
but they don &apos;t just buy the juice ; they &apos;re also buying the carbon in the trees to triple the water of the world &apos;s atmosphere , which is the product of the product to europe .
so the communication between brain and spinal cord , this leads to a complete and permanent paralysis of the leg .
and after a few years , it &apos;s been managed to develop a cyclical neuroprosthesis that has been formed the nervous system of a sleeping bag of a sleeping stick .
we &apos;ve been working hard at this goal to do this goal .

and i was a kid of the middle class .
he talked about the world , as she &apos;s &quot; and the world , as you should be . &quot;

in the white house , and the desk that he sits at is called &quot; the aw . &quot;
the last day , the woman who was doing everything , and we talked about it briefly . suddenly she said to me , &quot; would you sing me something ? &quot;
for this , this is a huge one of the voice that &apos;s a voice of the voice , because it &apos;s mysterious -- you can see -- it &apos;s completely spontaneously , and it &apos;s originally .
they didn &apos;t have anything .
so the internet needs the internet and instructions .
one of the most popular websites in the world that was run by the most powerful company in the world , and there was nothing to do on youtube or google .
and today wikipedia is so ubiquitous that you can even find them on the cards of restaurants in china .
and that has understood wikipedia .
this is a blog that &apos;s involved in a little bit of a time .
why ? there &apos;s a video maker in the field of water .
the world didn &apos;t end in the &apos; 90s .
and we see that the impact of the ecosystem on the road in some countries are very , very strong .
all of this costs money .
and it was done much to get students with the most socially efficient families , and they were getting the same opportunities .
how are schools and teachers in the media ?
in bureaucratic systems , teachers are left in the classroom alone , and they have a lot of the time to keep themselves on a lot of the road .
some people argue that the change of the climate change is similar to a viable effect .
but if you look at the issue of this perspective , you see what happened in the last 60 years .
and i went around the morning about 15 miles to get the peace center .
so that was obviously a kind of a design device .
we could also do this with telephones .
so , a business is going to come up for you .
&quot; government must offer economic services . &quot;
it was once , a long time ago , long time when i was 24 years old , i studied at the time at st. john &apos;s medical college in bangalore .

washington , d.c. went out .
not the bubble , not my bubbles , but the financial bubble .
will the rich countries really accept a completely changed economy , and the power transition of there , where they were over the last 50 to 100 years , after the west , was back to asia ?
the rest of the diagram is a very mysterious substance called dark energy .
but that explains the presence of the whole mass too .
and now you &apos;re paying attention to the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe -- a three-dimensional space .
again , this is a kind of a kind of a design model of what &apos;s going on during the national war .
they &apos;re moving away because the space is going to be bigger .
by looking at things like clusters of clusters -- their favorite systems , how many of you are as a function of time -- we can bring in experience , which is the way dark matter and dark energy are competing with making structures .
the big questions in physics .

so recycling and recycling are a lot of the time .
marc ebert : 1.3 million reasons to reinvent the world
and in fact , there were these changes in gay men in the united states during the 1980s .
it &apos;s a disease that kills a lot of adults in africa , and also many children .
in uganda , we see that the spread of the minimum .
it &apos;s pretty similar to close to the same .
but openness and connection has a price when we think of disease , and that should be no surprise .
coffee is uganda &apos;s skin .
emily libeskind once explores aids statistics in africa from an economic perspective and comes to a surprising conclusion : all our knowledge about the spread of hiv on the continent is wrong .
but i was fascinated by this , because i saw this kind of kind of high-tech italian radio system .
he was called &quot; the &quot; s &quot; -- &quot; he called , &quot; because he was the front of the road , but every time he went into a tunnel , he built a kind of a design set on the tunnel , and then there was a kind
these bumps are going to work on the water like a magnet .
we ask ourselves why the membrane is clogged and why it takes so much electricity .
for example , in the design of the ocean in a material .
in the process of engineering , my favorite , i &apos;m working with the most powerful architects , and we &apos;re working together with the most delicious bird .
janine benyus : biomimicry in the use of the use
&quot; yes , but why ? &quot;
we were four , not one , and fortunately , not a young boy .
you can &apos;t do anything about it .
it never happens in india , because it was now , and never again .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s get you praying . &quot;
this was a very , very popular for 1,000 inmates in this prison .
secondly , it &apos;s about the most important movement in india .
let me tell you about a project that we did several years later , a kind of a captcha .
basically , you do it by having an old book .
the number of pages that are using recaptcha is actually so high that the number of words we &apos;re documenting a day is very , very big .
some are more fun .
now , the web is divided into multiple languages .
then my favorite story comes from the question .
there &apos;s a way to beat two flies with a pop .
but what &apos;s more surprising , the translations we get from the world &apos;s dna , even if you &apos;re just a beginner , the translations we get are also exactly how the professional people are , and that &apos;s very surprising .
there are people who are learning about it , they don &apos;t have to pay with money , they pay attention to their time .
the carbon dioxide , the company , makes it really good , which is what you really can do .
and the active participation is all the normal .
and zipcar offers a very , very attractive , more powerful service that works fabulous .
for aristotle , happiness was the highest good , the goal of everything else .
maybe these people have right . his thoughts , maybe , is not good .
10 percent of the time , the idea of the time ... ... sex .
i played the violent african , the african terrorists .
now , from the first time , no adequate came out of the very , very much -- so nobody had the absolute majority -- so the elections in a second round three weeks later continued .
now here &apos;s an interesting comparison .
so i moved to la jolla , and i learned surfing .
people in the 17th century didn &apos;t really have a clue how we think that this stuff is a bunch of different molecules , and that we hold that out of a certain reason and so forth .
and so , and so , charles , i &apos;m going to put money to make you a building , and you can meet there , but you don &apos;t talk about religion there .
reality is what you can see .
i thought that every one of them would be able to do this .
just to see what would happen if you mix the two .
so i have something that &apos;s not personal .
if you want to become rich today , entrepreneurs will .
they say , if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , it &apos;s not going to be up -- it &apos;s not going to be at all . we &apos;re measuring it for 20 years , and it &apos;s not going to be .
aa kary stewart talks about the basis of modern science : the experiment . he tells stories from the 17th century and from his own family in the garden and the magic of good science in all their shapes .

and we &apos;re going to break up , &quot; we &apos;re the best scientific college in the world , &quot; because of our british hubris .
except , that -- they &apos;re going to be a professional -- well , in their 30-year , they thought , &quot; hmm , what happens in the night ? &quot;
and one of the most difficult problems is , if people have an idea of how everything works , it &apos;s pretty difficult to change this .
and as an expert for inorganic chemistry , i have friends and colleagues , who are different between the organic , living world and the inorganic world .
and you can see , he &apos;s wiping out , they &apos;re growing , in a way , in a way .
we even have amazing life systems that we can manipulate .
and darwin himself hired a letter to a colleague that was probably done in a little bit of a redwood , and that life was probably done somewhere in a warm pond -- maybe in scotland , maybe somewhere else .
what &apos;s life ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can connect them and literally create thousands and thousands of really large molecules , in the same size like dna and proteins , but it &apos;s not carbon in the view .
we want to install them in the environment and we want them to get their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can make inorganic biology and can bring matter to evolve , then it will define life in fact .
but there &apos;s another reason why i like this development goal : every single one is going to measure .
and these are high professionals , for a woman who sit on a woman for a woman and ask them to ask them to ask them to their favorite question .
i was really sitting on friday at friday , and i could see the mortality rate of the death of sponges on 84 .
as you know , these economists love the money , they always want more and more of them .
as you can see , it doesn &apos;t make a sense of measuring a policy of a improvement that wasn &apos;t , and that very fast progress .
but you don &apos;t talk about this as much .
in those who were high , or very high child mortality , child mortality and families were also very big , six to eight .
here &apos;s a fall of pills .
whatever is still worth money .
yeah , i went barefoot , until i was 12 .

it &apos;s still very hot , but not more friendly .
but this reactor isn &apos;t under high pressure , and it &apos;s not a hook that is so implanted , means that the most important thing is that the user is not going to be left .
i believe that the reactor i designed here is a innovative energy source that is going to provide great scientific projects with electricity and i &apos;m really ready to do this .
we move to a experience of economic experience where the experience is the actual product .
there &apos;s a producer that provides the most important thing to do for the case that they &apos;re running in the forest .
at the end of a long summary of good advice that he gives his son to his son , he says , &quot; especially , it &apos;s a matter of time against yourself , &quot; you know , it &apos;s a little bit more .
you don &apos;t normally go to los angeles , but there &apos;s a place where you can walk a lot , outside in this city .
then they will be totally determined as a car designer -- by providing properties that they don &apos;t have .
when i was small , i was very introverted and stayed for myself .
then it &apos;s just about starting to start on a point and then build them to the conclusion .
so i made it out of concrete , because it doesn &apos;t matter .
this was this tool .
and for me , this is the most important thing . because since i was a child , i wanted to convey my passion and love .
25 days , the perpetrator of the sun evolved 32 days : arms and hands are going to develop 36 days : the primitive spine begins to train these weeks , where the fetus evolves in the fastest .
the complexity , this is in a single system , again , beyond any understanding of the understanding of any understanding or any of the math .
because apparently there &apos;s this kind of memorable marketing system not in the atmosphere of sun-like stars .
so what can you do with these spectra ?
and i was sending a colleague of berkeley , and i was a colleague of berkeley , a very interesting spectrum , a very interesting spectrum , and said , &quot; can you look at this ? &quot;
there are two ways -- over the surface of the and the stars , and the chemical elements in the universe , and the way they &apos;re going to be able to get into the universe and get laughter .
because you can imagine that everything is more populous ?
now imagine an object , an incredible object , or something that we can &apos;t explain and we &apos;re just on and say , &quot; so , let &apos;s do it . physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
and if we see the oxygen , and oxygen , i think , we have the perfect e.t. , we think , the perfect e.t. .
i just said , &quot; really ? &quot; and he says , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what i can tell you is , it &apos;s universal ; we all have them .
i &apos;m slightly addicted to the math , but this is another talk .
this led to a small collapse -- -- that was actually more like that .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is , no , no , no more , no more powerful . &quot;
what are you going to feel vulnerable to ? &quot;
i &apos;m right , you don &apos;t have right . shut up .
we do that as if we do not have any impact on other people .
people are eating their meals in twitter , the olduvai occupation of their children on the iphone .
so if we think about it , they &apos;re using systematic improvements , and then we think about how they can be useful to our health care , for our environmental and self-awareness .
and today i want to talk about one of the things that we decided to do at the time , and we wanted to find a new access to health care .
so steven divides his story . but it &apos;s not alone .
here &apos;s why people pray .
i also love this kind of thing , also , this is the only one that was the only time online , and it was available online .
and here we have a paper .
you don &apos;t have any data , you don &apos;t have data , that &apos;s not going to be the scientific methods .
this is the curve above the ocean .
but my brother didn &apos;t go to him .
if we went from here today to the ted center , we would go to something that 300 feet high , 120 miles long , 28 miles wide , and the two gigatons weighs .
to change the state , you just need two volts of a brain &apos;s state .
we said , &quot; can you build this ? &quot;
we can do better .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that comes from so-called the so-called &quot; giant effect . &quot;
and the gap is the ideals of networks of complex systems .
and it also has implications on the systems of the systems .
so we could put a log in a rut .
we see the emergence of the creation of the world and the programs that are concerned about this , to understand our wired world of the complexity of the complexity .
so , the design of the capacity has a key capacity with the carbon capacity -- except you use expensive pumps and valves .
and we had 500 of these profiles .
without human security .
so we were up on our main table .
and this graph doesn &apos;t even mean something that &apos;s invented data .
and my brain starts to think very quickly that this is a key representation of negative to positive in the world .
because this question is that our external world can predict our energy capacity , but the truth is that i can only predict 10 percent of the person &apos;s energy , if i put it all out of the same external world .
and this is a scientific science project , and it &apos;s been wrong .
we &apos;re moving people when they open their hands , and they &apos;re doing a positive email of the design of the world or the most prolific of somebody in their social environment .
to say , a very difficult thing -- a little bit of a sudden , you know -- my father was the guy who &apos;s on the world .
and so i did . i went to mit .
they said , do it stop .
they take a huge disk out of cardboard .
he was the first digital media company in tokyo .
listen , you know ? how cows ? this is the morning 4 a.m.
so there are all these things to do , but most love i love to taste the world .
and i &apos;m tracking this with passion .
their culture is not coming in schools , and i want to show you ways to overcome this problem .
so that &apos;s why they &apos;re nervous because girls want to go to schools where there are no boys .
and over small moments in my life .
or mothers who have trained boys ?
we need to change attitudes to boys in elementary school .
and you have the impression that you think that would be okay .
let &apos;s see where these hypothesis are going .
is this a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we think that &quot; why &quot; embrace the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why &quot; we can do the fundamental evidence of nature .
i &apos;m going to try and leave that at the end , and i &apos;m also excited if it works .
and that was really an important lesson for me that you can &apos;t really act on an object .
we &apos;ve created a newspaper , for example , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s connected with my ipad , and it &apos;s a software that &apos;s going on on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a nuclear sandwich , so i put it around a little bit , so people respond to the glass , so people respond to the glass .
i &apos;m going to turn from my current age to a man , and then in an old man .
at 12,000 extra feet .
radio : what do you think of it ?
just fold the wings together and drive them on .
so i &apos;m going to ask you another question .
and he made a royal birthday , with a rock , who had instruction , and night , and night , but with the secret instruction , not particularly good to get him .
because they &apos;ve found that the human behavior is more likely to behave .
yet , we have to create a clear model of the brain , which is what you can do , and it &apos;s a lot of fair .
now , if we all have these tools to do , we just have to ask the question -- and thaler and engineering , what we use these smart uses .
they &apos;re going to lead the new color of the world .
they give up little , more delicious , recyclable .
i felt passion , soul and heart , my body left .
audience : no .
sb : no , not &quot; without &quot; no . &quot;
all around us , we can find a different replicator in this kind of culture of culture .
they probably bought them .
imagine the world full of brains and more memes than they all have .
we &apos;re the only ones we have and the most sophisticated .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
that was dangerous , but hello .
they use us to absorb the resource of the planet to produce more and more , and more amazing things that we hear here at ted .
and will we see this third danger , how we &apos;ve reached the second and first run ?
in collaboration with the food of the -- that &apos;s the most popular in haiti -- with the ministry of public health , with various kinds of food , four , four , four , four times more than 1,500 buildings .
it &apos;s not going to cost us anymore if we do it right . &quot;
and because i had a drink of 70 percent of my body , it took all about an hour .
we also found that it would have been good , you could have given me to the pain of the day to recover the pain of the pain .
and how bad would the punishment be , if i caught ?
it wasn &apos;t that the most important people -- the ones who have more commandments -- less cheated , and that the less religious -- those who could remember almost no commandments -- more cheated .
so if you don &apos;t think about the money for a few seconds , because you get a brand , does it make a difference ?
so it &apos;s like this .
i think all of these forces have very bad effects on the stock market .
but you can believe me . i work in the commercial .
these are the most important ones i can show you today .
and then , suddenly amazon becomes the brand and competing with the reserve , defined as they want to spend their money , which is money and what it is .
maybe this seems to be too big ?
so , the audience i don &apos;t have to keep on it , i had to explain , last week , i had to explain it to a nine-year-old -- skeletons are structures that are sperm from an individual to another .
and i already knew that animals like the most popular here , or even most animals don &apos;t stabilize tissues by easily divided them over bones .
and that was that every skeleton that we found up to the natural world had been the same as the same species of research .
all that i showed that was really surprised .
a funny song about the global warming , jill sobule .
well , i guess i guess i &apos;m going to be .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a piece ?
and the other thing that &apos;s called the design , and the most powerful , is the benefits of a great education .
the most powerful thing about this , and ben was totally turned out to a prison .
so , what &apos;s the area of this character ?
i was forced to leave my home , the democratic republic of congo , where i was a lot of time .
but remarkably , the united nations has been estimated the wealth of the country on the ground over 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not the goal .
they have to be very cheap to be available .
but could not be done for this angle of labor workers ?
they were asking them to serve government companies , and in many cases they have gotten them .
but let &apos;s take our goal , our goal is to bring new economic action on the ground .
because they needed a whole bunch of these little transactions to make their profits .
he liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to be in his own bed .
and since the nighttime , sir , and the british society for the federal community , that the sun is going to seem to be that .
so , what is fusion ? here &apos;s something .
and this energy is the same thing that drives fusion .
so , like a traditional power of power .
we need to make it a power station .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country and it &apos;s also one with great influence .
they wanted to do the most , they wanted to be the democracy , but they were all the world who had the population in the last month , and they had been a non-profit in the last month , and they were only four percent .
but the expectations of people for their future were important .
so the question is , &quot; what drives the male support for women &apos;s women &apos;s rights ? &quot;
i promise you , she read the message .
nobody can listen to you , just a text , just a text .
you could see the immediate impact of laws or the one of the most important talking on a computer table , and see what happens as a result .
the flight took 12 seconds , and went over 35 feet over 35 feet .
this is unnatural for a rocket .
it weighs less than a nuclear .
the smallest of the most prolific forces of the storms of nature .
we can do it as individuals and get hearing hearing .
we think somebody else , somebody else , somebody , somebody &apos;s more , is to solve this problem with more resources .
we didn &apos;t go to the pacific .
it took 10 full prototypes until we had something that really flew .
and so there &apos;s a side that &apos;s going to be , you know , this incredible improbability , which is possible , and that enormous seriously thing that means .
and let &apos;s think about our moral .
and the director was quite intimidating and told me that he thought he was mad , and he said to me , &quot; this place is a facility facility . these guys are heavy offenders .
it took several of these events to come up until i was supposed to do what i should do .
when i started this program four years ago , my main plan was a design plan of the world &apos;s office .
and you look down , and it &apos;s just so small and tiny .
i feel blessed , and happy that i had the courage to give my post on my behalf of a lifetime to nyu and return to my country where i could make these incredible rides with this group of ethiopia , morocco and russia .
and how often would my self be dying before i was going to understand that it hasn &apos;t existed from the beginning ?
and i was a really good dancer .
strangely , the insights not , i think , these insights don &apos;t mean my lower self-worth , this sense of otherness .
that was because i didn &apos;t have myself , what was inside .
imagine what kind of existence we could have , if we honor the inevitable death of self , the privilege of life , and the privilege of what comes next .
and this is a cafe at the sea in the u.k.
but instead of looking at this , we focused on how we work .
we also discovered that as a design structure , and a kind of a design structure , would get through this structure .
but we found that seeds -- this really important project , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to find -- but that seeds -- in the leading olympics , are not going to be put seeds in the world &apos;s top .
we worked with a computer company to develop a solar seed of the seed seed , so if you &apos;re visually impaired , so if you &apos;re visually impaired , it &apos;s kind of like a little bit of a space that you see here .
it &apos;s actually just the first few papers you realize , and the rest is just for postcards .
the book carries &quot; the blank slate , &quot; the popular idea , that the human spirit is a blank slate , and all of his structure of its socialization , culture , education and experience .
well , there &apos;s a number of political reasons that you like to do it well .
it &apos;s still not clear whether these generalizations are integrated , but the other thing that the most powerful thing seemed like is to try and deal with this .
another one of the humanities and the university of universities that are actually in many ways in decline .
now , the other hot iron is the parenting .
and i think you can &apos;t tell this better .
i also call it portland , just like this , and you don &apos;t like it , but you &apos;re not telling it .
there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no nonsense .
he says , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i &apos;m thinking right now . &quot;
oh , i live in a computer program -- that &apos;s strange .
so i asked myself what would happen if we challenge some of these things .
right ?
it &apos;s like this -- we &apos;ve been talking about the war , as a society , every of us .
your iphone without the people who make the same skin , same circuit , same keyboard , always and again .
and then it became more aggressive and more aggressive and more important , and now it &apos;s a little bit more important .
and i said to brian , &quot; what did tony do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; so , is it true that you &apos;re going to be wrong here ? &quot;
but how do you sit in a sane way ?
so all of the things that were going on in tony &apos;s office , proof of it , is that he was a kind of crazy way of being crazy .
he came in failing and more and more of 30 percent of the workforce , and the american cities just turned to the u.s.
and i added , &quot; i have a list of psychopathic features in my pocket .
and the jewelry are always the opposite aspects of the language of the people .
anyway , that was two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended .
in fact , the trend went to the rest of the world .
and as a result of these conversations , it &apos;s very , very difficult to say , i represent the true islam . &quot;
it may be that a big war between east and west became the trend of communism , and that it was necessary to be in the framework of communism .
and even though the president is , it &apos;s very , very good for the reason to get out of islam , not the enemy of islam , is not the enemy , but it &apos;s still a natural impulse to call the other side as an enemy .
when the treasure in 2000 went , you just watched the peak of the best , the scientists who had the scientists who had the scientists who had been used for african penguins -- that at this point , as an endangered species .
on the day after our day , two of us were going to be the record of space 2 , and space 2 , more than 4,000 , oiled penguins .
we &apos;ve used this method in the treasure rescue .
and this is really important because the african penguin was explained a year ago to an endangered species .
on the top side , the middle row , the most prolific , a computer center , in the front of the world , and even before the police police .
people are open to the water industry .
we launched this campaign -- very compelling -- &quot; every egg counts &quot; every egg .
this is not a second class of the second grade .
these teach , the abstract , abstract .
hillel hired himself to a leg , and said , &quot; what you &apos;re doing is not to do that , you don &apos;t do that . that &apos;s the most important thing . the rest is comments .
now -- this is not the whole story .
and achilles &apos;s body picks up body and hands in the father , and the two men see each other and see each other as a divine .
this is what the cells really look at me in biology and science , looking at living cells in the microscope .
every grain of sand has a size of a millimeter .
you can see these kinds of things .
this picture was the beginning of the world &apos;s first .
we all look at the same from inside , believe me .
the walls are 700 millimeters thick , solid concrete .
and that &apos;s an x-ray on the left .
it has human association .
in x-ray , we see all the little bits of glass in the corners .
i had to have the car in the middle , and i had no really simple task .
yes , they &apos;ve given 12 monkeys a week , and after this week , they only use them as a toilet .
the science actually says that we &apos;re going to live forever .
no , i &apos;m a tooth .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you . goodbye .
where do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we &apos;re both not .
not professor and convicted , only two spirits , ready to get ready .
and then my life was all right .
all i saw in the building was that there was right to be involved between the u.s. services between the world &apos;s office and the world &apos;s office .
would you even be time to process information ?
we spent a lot of time with this , a billion dollars , and they &apos;re hearing right -- a billion of the street systems , which he was talking about , and what we found was shocking , but more than that later .
then there &apos;s dan etete .
we were horrified that these companies had rapidly had their own business companies , and the most important in london , the most important in london .
it &apos;s too complex and difficult to change it .
we &apos;re going to die all the time . we &apos;re going to all be sick . we &apos;re going to leave people . people are leaving us .
there are places that you can &apos;t go to think about , you know , the worlds you can &apos;t replicate anymore .
they have a community and a freedom that i believe that they &apos;re the foundation of a new design system .
she has hit the decision , not getting a more sophisticated or more or more or more to get your life that this is not happening any other girl .
we &apos;re all refugees .
but you &apos;re going to take this thing to the head , and then that &apos;s what happens .
but this is not what you do . &quot;
i miss michael .
but he didn &apos;t find it , he didn &apos;t find him his staff , but he said , &quot; you &apos;re going to go to rehab , or you &apos;re going to die and die . &quot;
ahh ! we meet them , the secret beloved . let &apos;s pull them out .
if it &apos;s on the box , which is the most important thing , it &apos;s going to form it .
the characteristics that the word is to be expressed is so often in adults , that we should be denied this age of the age of the age of being avoided , and to criticize behavior that &apos;s associated with the brain , and irrational thinking .
if i got the ability to come back 10 percent of the interest that i &apos;ve been in on your last loan , i &apos;m going to be constrained by your ability to get more money from me to you until she has paid it back .
it &apos;s why we don &apos;t live in the dark times .
and the third is all the sounds that we create people who are creating the most powerful .
this is after selective sensing .
there are many of the main types of corn , among other people , the way animals are teaching us to dance and sing that i have a different time .
so that was extremely embarrassing .
and if you wonder how much that is , this is 16 kb .
so 37 is our house .
it &apos;s very impressive and a very beautiful concert .
and these are the issues that are actually on the heart .
a generation that &apos;s so much meaning of video games , as a real thing , is coming out of the real world .
all of these are problems outside my final story .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of video games means for our civilization .
finally ! finally ! that &apos;s it .
he would love it really well .
so , you get quickly from the simple to complex , if you do more . that &apos;s what we like .
and then they look at them , and they &apos;re a dolphin -- i thought that &apos;s a long time until they told me that it &apos;s something that they &apos;re thinking about , so they think about it .
it &apos;s going to drive the other direction .
girl : there &apos;s a bullet and a computer ball , because it &apos;s two completely different kind of educational , and if you drop them at the same time , maybe you &apos;ll fall down .
but we could not train a thousand new teachers to save our lives .
and it &apos;s a sound system . &quot;
and ultimately , we &apos;re going to change ourselves as we change the world around us .
that &apos;s an incredible impact .
why do they do what they do ?
everybody would want the new version .
they affect us too much .
they &apos;re actually going to come up with this point .
i &apos;ll go back to the order of the words .
&quot; well , yes , &quot; i said , &quot; weird , you ask that .
and they &apos;re like , &quot; you don &apos;t need to do that again . &quot;
we saw ourselves , and i was grateful because they just said , &quot; wow ! this is insane . &quot;
the goal of the project is very simple .
this is completely personalized medicine in the field of water .
now the answer is a team of a team .
i work with the millennium epidemic , and the most serious thing that some serious problems have done with the project , problems that don &apos;t have to have .
in medicine , there are so many people who don &apos;t want change , not just if a car engineer is the answer .
you can really find novel solutions that haven &apos;t been seen , and that &apos;s just very quick and simple .
yes , good , you guys put me on my life because the time of the time , it &apos;s about beautiful , of beautiful pluripotent form .
no , but it &apos;s true : the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i met the most sophisticated .
and i didn &apos;t ask them to draw nice cartoons .
thank you .
so , &quot; our lonely earth &quot; brought me all over the meeting with the audience .
we &apos;ve been more at the same time for the existence of animals as they &apos;ve been here , until we &apos;ve been able to reach the second microbial era .
his impact is the distribution of these very thin steel mechanisms across the planet , and we had a very , very sophisticated death of dinosaurs , death of this beautiful , white , and more than that .
it &apos;s the top of the whole sphere , t. rex .
they hate animals .
this is when material comes from the deep of the earth and the surface , spread over the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m a retired one from the coast , which is going to happen to me ?
they have an accident . they have two options : they &apos;re going to die , or they take the hydrogen sulfide and say 75 percent of them will be saved , mentally .
so , blessing : blessing and curse .
some of you are countries who are the opinion that deregulation or even no regulation of the best way is to encourage investments to promote trade .
the answer is just : the chinese define these factories as chemical businesses , not as a chemical service , and don &apos;t check them .
i don &apos;t know what we can do , but i can use my office at least to bring them all together to create a solution . &quot;
they need a safe environment .
now we have the impression that it &apos;s about the beginning of a new way of regulation to the international world .
human rights is to be a very simple question : can i give people back to this ?
or to find the young , the young that has laid the fire to see if you can change it . &quot;
okay , ready ? go .
i was fire and the flame .
again , again , we saw the spoken word movies of the movies .
after the fight , he shook his head , and he &apos;s crying hair , and she said , &quot; you &apos;re a god . &apos; &apos; no , you &apos;re the god . &quot;
i travel a lot , when i teach , and i don &apos;t always get to see my third step , but i had the lucky one to see her , and i had the lucky one to see her journey as she did .
my parents have called me sarah , which is a prison name .
i want to first talk about some ideas that have driven me to become a computer company .
when i saw the war for everyone was having such incredibly profound consequences , and that the most powerful thing was actually a factor in conflict conflict , i wanted to be a photographer to be a war war .
at the same time in south africa , after nelson mandela had been released from prison , the black population was released the last phase of liberation .
the next day i went to rwanda , and it was as if i was up in the hell of hell in hell .
after the fall of the head of the ice in indonesia , i started studying the conditions of poverty in a country that was on the way to modernization .
a hospital of &quot; doctors without borders &quot; in a refugee camp .
the most efficient is that the percentage of the soldiers , the percentage of the soldiers , is a lot higher in this war , in this war , as much as in our history .
so to ensure that it can run as little as possible , we have all these procedures in the choice .
so you choose this way .
but this is a broad , very difficult topic , so i had to be constrained .
the size is the population -- there &apos;s a big china , big india .
and in all eastern religions , the level of the world was the same .
because death is going to be a child &apos;s child .
and what is the reason in qatar ?
they have a great job of science .
all religions on the world are able to maintain their values and adapt to these new world .
and then , as all of our generation , we lived in a museum program .
day eight .
in india alone , my favorite friends went to the door of my friends and i went to door with this same image , to every single house in india . we did about a billion of the world &apos;s worth of research .
this is the most important thing .
i asked them -- it &apos;s all the kind of stuff -- and i asked them questions that they want to ask them .
i think we owe debt to the exports and ron st. john john &apos;s very much , i hope , ron is somewhere in the audience -- he &apos;s the founder of homicide .
larry brilliant : first of all , are they not mad because of the opposition of the copyright protection ?
have a computer set built , &quot; the climate group . &quot;
why should we have a positive impact on the world , on the world , as a company ?
they save 85 percent of electricity with an led that they had used with an old light bulb .
sometimes people think that 100 percent will be pretty hard , and we had this conversation in the company .
a video researcher pays himself to be seven or eight years .
from our 17,000 energy technologies in the ikea ikea , we &apos;re now 47 percent women , but that &apos;s not enough and we want to close this gap and the way to get into the high management management .
there was a equation in my family , about this : if you &apos;re intelligent , you &apos;re like , you &apos;re not spiritual .
this , he wrote , &quot; is the integrated structure of reality . &quot;
anyone whose attitude you can do or get a clean off of your ears .
the end of our computer , we realized the openness of the other .
as i would go back to bangalore , i would go back to bangalore , and often a vibrant argument at my friends , where we discussed different themes , while they were complaining about new design issues , where a drink would cost their 14 years old .
he &apos;s looking for forgiveness , and he says that he wants to improve life of his child mortality .
this pakistani pakistani seemed quite happy to be , and it didn &apos;t have a deaths to keep the deaths even though dozens of times of the time in liberia .
and how are we responsible for this ?
it &apos;s troubling -- not ? -- that the media of the world is doing such a bad job that a small group of activists is able to publish more from this kind of information than the rest of the world &apos;s press .
j yeah . this was the cover of the guardian and it was then printed around kenya in all countries around kenya , in the south african press and south african press .
j the effects of people who worked on it were smallest .
and there are lots of information .
i would be interested in what we &apos;ve heard about -- i &apos;m curious about the opinion of ted audience .
and we said , &quot; oh , tell us more .
so you have to be careful with the term of hackers .
and only a month ago , it was passed up all the way from the national parliament parliament .
and from all these numbers , i start with only two or three variables .
this piece here can be read very differently , depending on where you &apos;re going to do it .
i first read about this in a radius of a little bit of a sudden , and the middle of the world &apos;s health care system was going to be a responsible thing for responsible medicine and seven .
so according to this survey , the best is the best to make it not too short , but not too long in it , but not too long to get it black , and a partial of chocolate of chocolate , brown sugar or saltwater .
and then in the next summer , i worked under the line of dr. kamen &apos;s line at fort degrees , texas .
and this realization is incredibly for efficiency of chemotherapy , perhaps for many different types of cancer .
for example , resilient organic compounds are chemical pollutants that are found in our schools , in our schools , and the workplace .
because all of these solutions are , of course , they &apos;re sustainable and they &apos;re more powerful -- the main generation of our generation and for the next generations .
and immediately a voice called &quot; cala ! &quot;
after the conference , after my talk , people came to me , men and women .
hard !
a prosthetic is not anymore for the need to cost a lack of it .
we &apos;re all different different perspectives .
i was in the beijing way to go to the olympic games .
about 80 percent of these are young people , among a third of the people .
and they &apos;re most unemployment , and they &apos;re highly breeding , recyclable , recyclable banks of the banks , the coal of the world , the united states , and the products that they produce , they &apos;re exposed to .
they have a kind of a tool that they can get on a piece of chicken or fish , and it looks like cattle .
people think about the following question : will we keep our environment further to a higher gdp ?
there &apos;s nothing up there , but the conditions were ideal for the winter .
now , the series hasn &apos;t been even kept out , so they &apos;re the first to see this .
mars is similar to the earth , it seems to be equally damaging .
sousa was afraid that we had the opportunity to lose this , quote , quote , &quot; machines . &quot; you would take us .
but more importantly , bmi used to be used in common works to create new forms of energy that they put free on their clients , and then in 1940 , when they were a bust , the majority of the card was being adopted , the majority of the
and i ...
for the balance i &apos;m trying to do , i &apos;m going to try to be a good liberal of the government , and i &apos;m going to be a mistake , right ?
this insight is incredibly provocative , incredibly provocative .
okay , i don &apos;t want to alert any doubt , but i just noticed that the person on the right is a liar .
&quot; honey , you don &apos;t see fat , no . &quot;
another study , however , showed that strangers are lying in the first 10 minutes of their own .
here &apos;s koko with her kitten .
i &apos;ll say it again .
so , liars doesn &apos;t look at the eyes of a little bit .
we say , &quot; yes , as we shake the head . &quot;
science has been brought up very much signs on daylight .
look at exactly the same thing and you &apos;ll see the whole video in the world .
so in this way , in this way , it can be a bit more powerful to us , a little bit more clear in terms of our moral rules .
and that &apos;s not true , right ?
you know , we often think that language is the world that we live in , but it &apos;s not true .
so what &apos;s going on as a computer designer , if not even tragic joke about harry , is defined as ethnic management .
six months after that , no any explanation , they let me free .
that &apos;s what makes me trouble .
when i was 10 , i read james chaplin &apos;s country , and i was broken in this book .
a new song i suggested you .
so i took a little time to study coke .
and in the remote areas of africa , it &apos;s hard to find a good road .
how do you make an incentive based on the impact that you have on the remote villages ?
i &apos;m not so clever about the &quot; aw &quot; of &quot; the &quot;
they &apos;re waiting to be cut .
much more people were have been magnets .
today i &apos;m going to tell you two things . first of all , what we lost , and secondly , how we get it .
here you can see the largest part of the living of the florida , the florida .
if there &apos;s no fishing in a reef , because it &apos;s limited to protected , or isolation , it &apos;s great .
after a few years after five to seven years , the fish come back , food the sea floor , and then the algae grow again .
you can see the border of the world &apos;s surface , because there are all the boats back there .
if it &apos;s so good , if that &apos;s so simple , how much is it ?
so the protection of the line is to be the sea of the world , and the ocean has become a philanthropy for governments and the government , and that &apos;s not acceptable .
in the coral reefs , we found that the pyramid is the equivalent of the equivalent of the light to the ground where five lions come to a giant block .
okay , enric , thank you for having a part of your spiritual experience , thank you .
it &apos;s been true as the longest creature in the ocean .
they come to the submersible -- they come to the submersible , and they come to the submersible .
in other ways , we &apos;re trying to take our partners in woods , that virtual world -- this world , this folded area -- to get into the lab .
bl : these worms don &apos;t have a dance . they don &apos;t have mouth .
what we &apos;ve seen was from the pacific .
we &apos;re going to try to show you the pacific pacific .
these worms grow several centimeters in the week .
the concept of the design system is zero .
and the rest one percent , a percent , is projected for the formula they can apply to the situation .
they also have the mathematical structure that &apos;s from the surface of the pyramid , measurements , the dots , the dots , the axes , and the ones .
students have to do these things . they need to make them different .
and the best thing , or one of the best parts , is that we &apos;re not getting the answer from the bottom of the world &apos;s .
what &apos;s probably happening with the small hadron collider ?
here &apos;s the fastest growing young population in the world .
it &apos;s a little bit of a time . there &apos;s no government schools in the slums .
this is a computer that was installed in the entrance in the entrance , which was installed by a world-changing social entrepreneur called sugata mitra , who took the most sophisticated experiments that showed the kids under certain conditions , to learn that children could learn to learn .
well , the key is motivation , and in two ways , it &apos;s in two ways .
this is a school in a bus in pune , who &apos;s the fastest growing city in asia .
you should turn it into a mcdonald &apos;s .
there are formal projections , schools , domestic hospitals , hospitals , in which innovation can happen , and informal environments , communities , social networks .
every child to age 15 , which wants to be a place in a school , in 2015 , will be able to get a position .
and as i look at him , this scene comes out that comes to tears , and i &apos;ve been doing it for 25 years .
here &apos;s a couple of parents , and we have to do it all the time , and we have to cook for them -- and they &apos;re eating every night for two , three or four , and it &apos;s ridiculous .
he goes around and you get expensive everything !
these gay people like me , like , are treated as a full citizen , and it &apos;s just written right away from our nose .
there are people who have to be scared of their job , so they don &apos;t show who they really are , here at home , and it &apos;s not just about north carolina ; in all states without any color , it &apos;s legal .
think about it .
and i got scared .
about three years ago , i read a paper in the new york times .
who were my grandparents ?
they help us become what we could have been .
this is how evolution works .
and in fact , here &apos;s this insect .
i had a smell of somebody on a couple of other .
it &apos;s not just rotating on 43 to 44 degrees c , but it keeps a constant temperature .
but contrast is going to be like this . it &apos;s going to be going to be a little bit ahead of the background .
here &apos;s the russians , and the russians , and yes , it was -- actually -- a game .
she started telling me , and all the parents are going to see the most important thing .
i have an irish story .
our lives will be defined by data , and the presentation of this data is to create a fantastic interface that &apos;s great to tell the great stories .
i &apos;ve also thrown a look at the different computer types , because you can choose what you want to highlight from the data data .
it &apos;s a man &apos;s husband who is sitting in the box and controls this kind of thing .
a more 11 of about 11 sheep per hour , which is a drug of 68 cents .
in fact , you can see what you &apos;re seeing on the left side , the most important thing you see is the frame of the screen , and on the right you see the frame of 16 people who don &apos;t know what they do .
selam bell : slave mania , slave guru ... aaron , and we took all these pieces and the pieces of them into another mechanical turk .
but we knew that we needed to take the right person to ask us to put ourselves behind us and build something .
and all of the frames that people have submitted to the project .
thank you .
so i made rows of images , cut , and put it in the back of the street .
a meritocratic consequence of that is that you &apos;re always seeing one part of his image , and that leads to a very free structure .
and sometimes i have an emotional response to news , like the earthquake in haiti .
then i went 50 miles , then 60 kilometers .
it &apos;s like the different layers of the things we &apos;re doing , and what we &apos;re presenting to the world as our identity .
another kind of a new design system is in a public library in san jose , california .
so every building has its own personality .
it may be easier today to be more easily than ever before , to make a good job .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re very materialistic .
it &apos;s just too strange .
you know , in the middle ages , in england , if you met somebody who was very poor , you called this one &quot; unhappy &quot; . literally , somebody who was lucky , the fate of the fate , not a more painful .
and this is going to be done with the youngest court with angels and one-year-olds , and the sky will open .
i then told you the action of spontaneous floyd .
what i think i really talked about is success and failure .
we should make sure that we are really the creator of our own ambition .
alain de botton : a very shaky , gentler
if you train for this sport , you don &apos;t smile .
you know , you swimming with your goggles , and you cut 60 trains a minute , so you &apos;re never really on a little bit of a little bit of a time , you can &apos;t see it .
they &apos;re in the liquid .
my breath is down three to three main points .
and the expected thing to worry about me is i didn &apos;t care about them .
i swam with this thing .
it &apos;s the only thing that &apos;s interested in me .
that &apos;s already what we have today .
the gateway can be a smartphone , or it could be a particularly special gateway , like today , many of these things are special , because they &apos;re not so embedded .
many of you have gotten the phillips direct life .
this is a part of our life . we should sleep a third of our lives .
ok . let &apos;s go from sleep to diseases .
so we can change medicine in the field of age , in all ages , from aids , or aids , to the elderly , changing the arena , the entire spectrum of the disease -- i hope i &apos;ve got a sense of it -- about the world .
so , i hope i &apos;ve convinced you -- the impact on the top of the brain are enormous and the effects on diseases are also impressive in all these different diseases and more .
how do we make robust societies ? longevity .
and in the novel , a certain called alvin is produced , and he says , maybe it &apos;s not the best way , and destroyed the whole system .
and so there were no more painful things .
and she &apos;s a great thing .
steam should be faster .
maybe you wonder how we make these things .
our only cookbook is the world in the world , where the grim world &apos;s .
this is the finished hamburger .
a talk about surgical robots also have a talk about surgery .
and surgeons were more business companies than doctors .
but ultimately , the woke up .
they had to give up their intuitive movements with the instruments .
i &apos;ve told you about the big , complicated robot .
and as you can see , there &apos;s going to be something that &apos;s going to be useful to do something useful , that &apos;s not going to be so much more useful .
and we don &apos;t even have to go on this particular level of time .
we &apos;re here to talk about accidents .
but we had a problem .
okay , well , it was partly my fault .
we don &apos;t just show that bacteria can be the solution to plastic waste , but also that the openness to the plastic is made of the power of the information and the risks of risk .
the film we &apos;re going to see is the same for the most important in new york .
i &apos;m not an exception .
it went on . they always tried to make things better .
they don &apos;t say , &quot; our style are curves . let &apos;s make the house curved . &quot;
i think in my family , we &apos;ve been very lucky to do it , because we &apos;ve learned backwards backwards .
dawn , very good !
ed : and then the sum side is a historic site , because in the most recent history , paris has taken their beginning to where the message has been in .
you see this chair ? the orange one ? this is the most orange chair . the city chair .
because it &apos;s part of where we want to get .
it was a lot of outrage . they were full of speculation . they were a little bit of a solid information .
one of them is known : the population population is coming from two to almost seven billion people in the last 50 years .
brent mullen : being here .
you see , the lines are going to check out when the population population is happening .
before i talk about the cost , i have to hold very clear that i &apos;m going to hold it out .
this is what liberation looks like .
but just since recently , we can do a technical advancement , now the quantum theory and quantum locking .
first of all , some strands of magnetic field in inner spaces are trapped , but the superconductor doesn &apos;t like it when they &apos;re moving , and they &apos;re going to be the power of energy , and so the most important thing .
and so , of course , this round magnet can also expand to form a variety of positions .
and it was inspired by this quote from douglas adams , the situation is from &quot; by allison &quot; by the galaxy .
because of course they don &apos;t explain how to do it , if you want to do it , and not a more powerful .
but even though they didn &apos;t believe , they said , &quot; okay , we &apos;re calling back . &quot;
so , i am sure , yeah , i have .
so some will say , &quot; what happens if moore &apos;s law is going to go to the limits ? &quot;
today you can buy half a billion . and you &apos;re even better , because you &apos;re faster .
but where are we going to get the software ?
larry page has been a passionate talk on our computer culture , which he &apos;s doing for the very big challenges of humanity .
they wanted to start the fish .
that may be insignificant , but it &apos;s incredibly scary , which is a lot of rumors to hear that another one , greater one , greater than the last , is going to come to the last 13 , or maybe maybe ...
so the tsunami can be seen as a kind of disruptive moment , a moment where the blogosphere were grown up .
probably it &apos;s in three to five percent of the number of jellybeans in the glass , and it would be better than the estimate of 90 to 95 percent of them .
somebody has a link , so other people link , etc . , etc .
he &apos;s finished his head of paper , and i put a lot of heavy to get out of paper with a low deadline of paper , but he &apos;s just saying , &quot; this is all i want to do . &quot;
so , i &apos;ll show you 30 seconds now , from the thing that &apos;s the thing that &apos;s going on .
these habitat are more of the earth &apos;s land than all other habitats combined .
many of us , i &apos;m locked in , think that the exploitation of the oceans are only in the last 50 or maybe 100 years , really seriously .
this is a cable connected to the whole , and our hands are on the bottom of the sea floor .
so there &apos;s a barcode on this product that &apos;s telling the computer exactly what the product is .
but i want to share with you some of my favorite discoveries of the census .
we don &apos;t know why they do that , we don &apos;t know .
this graph is based on a brand brand in the scientific world , which is going to appear in the scientific journal of biology .
but it &apos;s not all about it .
i have a way to confront this as an architect .
mitchell sagmeister : don &apos;t build a house , grow it !
i think that &apos;s very interesting , and very encouraging , because what you &apos;ve heard in the last few days is the sense of going into different directions : directions , which are specific and unique for the problems .
now , we all think that the most obvious of romantic poets was a huge romantic poet , many of us , he wrote that he wrote some wonderful essays , and the most famous essay is a word called the hairs .
i &apos;m going to read that .
and to a certain time of his life , they &apos;re going to be on rocks .
but let me show you the latest robotic robot .
if you used to , before the digital radio , the casa network and &quot; the &quot; s &quot; on the board , that was this noise .
the basic idea of the design of the internet &apos;s energy is that you have two sources of information that the implications are .
that means i have to make predictions about the future .
now , there &apos;s a very clear example of where one of me feels very different , and when it &apos;s made by one other person , it &apos;s when it &apos;s produced by another person .
and in the meantime , i got two daughters .
so they didn &apos;t know the rules that the other person does .
if these dots were cars on a mountain table , they wouldn &apos;t have a clue what to go .
we &apos;ve shown that we can explain a big part of the data -- people actually plan to make their movements very precisely to minimize the negative consequences of noise .
this is from the ross national iv world .
mars has the largest largest industrial system of the solar system , the most powerful .
this is my favorite . it was taken a few weeks ago .
the oldest stone on earth is just 3.6 billion .
and the result of our meeting was a computer called ares .
we fold it , and we transport it in a spacecraft .
this is about the internet , oregon .
i think there &apos;s a way of looking at this -- &quot; eight to 12 . &quot;
and there was a guy who sold these weapons for lego , because lego -- the most delicious -- no , they weren &apos;t on guns .
and then there are some examples of the stuff that are real sculptures .
i have to tell you , i had changed all this evening .
perhaps most important , the impact on other companies is enormous .
in fact , politics has been rejected by the internet .
in brazil , there are now an extension of 18 times more sophisticated , whereas the united states only has 700 , and it &apos;s two in california -- and within three years , the percentage of the country is up to 85 percent .
this is not a real thing . biofuels are a really big thing .
scientists explain us -- and these are just estimates that we have to have the gdp of greenhouse gases , and that &apos;s how fast it is .
i can barely wait to do what we were doing to tedsters against the crisis .
there are fewer people who are still available , which are being contagious , and then you get this kind of thing that &apos;s going to be called the &quot; the curve of the curve , &quot; you get this classic curve .
b is on the edge of the network .
and that &apos;s what happens to every one of the tests .
the red dots are going to be the most important , and the yellow dots are friends of people who are going to be a flu .
would you get immunity to the ground ?
and there are , i think , three ways of being used in this kind of data that &apos;s going to be used .
the building was in construction until collapse of the world &apos;s economy and death of the beginning of the &apos; 90s .
although it seems to be a completely chaotic place , if you see it from top , there &apos;s a whole web of the internet , and channels that connect every single house .
in this tradition , the bride shows all of your possessions that you &apos;re going to bring your new husband to your new husband .
what a place like the norwegian david is particularly remarkable is this kind of kind of thing , where people have a foundation that you can use to use .
we can just ask : &quot; how hot the average of the design of the world &apos;s day ? &quot; and what else is it to do -- or what else we want to ask .
it has replaced the workers through technology .
you can see some symbols on the left , some of the symbols that show it to his right arm .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re always getting older .
or even if we &apos;re getting a lot older , our cars can go to the way we can visit people .
they were gone in a moment .
it &apos;s always been more apparent that we can &apos;t win .
the two specialists behind the curtain are going to help me to get the result on the screen .
one of the journalists said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
the evangelical ones are the same as jewish breeding .
i think there are some , actually , many reasons , but here &apos;s just a few of us on the verge of this .
he was attracted to fire , he painted her , he was like a little bit of a sudden , a little bit of a sudden .
let me go door to the door of the door to the international community , and see if somebody &apos;s police or troops are the ones that are these services .
but for sergio , it was too late .
he saw her .
majora power : a complicated hero
this means jobs and possibilities of all the way along .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about food because it was actually this year , last year and 2008 , during the u.s. war , and in 2008 , for every single pound of calories .
and i go to these stores when they &apos;re there , in order to see what they can get , and i find , you can &apos;t get food .
we see the social participation of the school of girls .
i want to talk about something that i call digital food .
and what i found is that instead of investing in subsidies and other things , invest in a school program .
thank you .
we could do the same thing in cancer .
they &apos;re not going to go longer to a nuclear .
it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a kind of a design device , not because it shows me how many of the people i &apos;m doing every day , but because it &apos;s 24 hours long , which i do .
that &apos;s never been shown .
the productivity of this magnets is so big that we can see a single neutron with this technology .
you don &apos;t have to shrink the tumor .
if the magnet is big enough , and their resolution high enough , they can actually be able to get all the proteins in the body and start to understand the individual system .
most of us are actually reassuring , and interestingly , 12 vibrations per minute about the most prolific one minute .
so , for example , if i &apos;ve been here -- more than a few seconds , you would feel uncomfortable ; longer than a few minutes , and you would leave the hall in circulation .
and that &apos;s all recognized . and that &apos;s the tune that is very much in the world that &apos;s in the world .
and i stood there with two very good friends , richard locke and kevin atwood .
as we cross miles and miles of the road , frozen , the north african could be the most prolific .
so , as i &apos;m standing here today , and i &apos;m talking to you about the most about five years , i &apos;m about five years .
just 10 miles before the coast and in southern kenya .
the ocean is climate and weather , they keep the temperature stable and shapes the chemistry of the world .
so , there are easy things .
this is the result , if you don &apos;t know , that there are limits for what we need to take the oceans .
in the last three years , the u.s. for example , the u.s. epidemic , has been protected as a sea of ocean protected .
we need a new , new technology to study the ocean .
so a lot of my early career , i wanted to figure out how the wings of insects are producing enough force to keep themselves in the air .
let &apos;s study this idea of simplicity .
this is a beautiful picture of visual engineering of a mouse from jeff &apos;s lab , and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk .
they &apos;re a little bit of a design trip to take some behavior on a different basis , another kind of engineering , and they can think that this works in a very complicated system .
our mission is to build a computer program and build a realistic computer model of human brain .
he &apos;s home and drinking tea .
if you look closer to the surface of the neocortex , you &apos;re going to get it out of louder little components , and it &apos;s like a computer , like in a computer .
how many type a type of type is there ? where are they place ?
we can look at the tissue . and we can change neurons .
we can upload all these neurons , every single one in its own processor , it &apos;s activate , and see what happens .
and the other thing is , the secrets of the brain can be solved soon , mental illness , memory , memory , perceptions : they &apos;re made of neurons and electrical signals , and he &apos;s planning to take care of a supercomputer that &apos;s called the brain with
it would be necessary for two or three thousand bombs .
the air force started to build smaller models , and started this .
this is what nasa did to get a more sophisticated , which would fly to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about the design of the behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write . because there &apos;s so much resonance that you can get from people .
the bottom ? yellow .
if you ask people to ask that question , think that it has something to do with culture .
the countries on the right , the ones that give them a lot of different forms , have a slightly different form .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this .
but getting back to him , once again , it becomes more complex .
a online illustrator for 59 dollars .
the universal idea here , by the way , is that we really don &apos;t know our biases as well .
in fact , in medical situations , this is our view .
and radio waves are limited .
in infrared , you can use the eyes of the eyes with low energy .
their intensity can be imposed very quickly and it can be very quickly off .
they &apos;re critical .
but the way is that .
cars have a lot of time and the water and they can communicate with each other and can communicate through the car lights and so on .
dna is what &apos;s mean to be mean .
because it &apos;s actually not so many data .
you have the genome genome , and the power of it is a mixed medicine that is better than the current -- she has no side effects .
it &apos;s really easy -- just did it , just in fact , just in fact , it &apos;s just a very , very rigid gene -- but we could completely get it completely immersed .
we don &apos;t run as little organisms alone on the world , but they &apos;re part of a big ecosystem .
the consequences can be bad -- if we &apos;re destroying or the earth -- but that &apos;s just the consequence of one of us .
now i &apos;m mostly here , because it &apos;s a kind of digging up in dog dog at the moment that we have a side of people who think that you get a dog to get out of the first , by making the rules , human rules .
they &apos;re just like that &quot; &quot; s &quot; , just to beat . and therefore they &apos;re beaten .
no , we &apos;re doing &quot; puppy , sit . &quot; boom , he can take it for six to 10 .
they &apos;re like golden warming .
and i would say , if you don &apos;t need it , you might not be to be .
not only with the puppy , but also with the rest of the family .
these are the kinds of things that are so simple .
their children are just to train .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , this windmill -- does it work ?
wk : yeah . i still think of working with energy .
because even though i used scientific terms , it &apos;s very hard to make it very hard to make them sound .
and even more rare , if it &apos;s accompanied by the plastic and the water , like in my case .
one is a white flash of light .
64 with 75 .
let &apos;s look at the third question .
the desert continued to expand a mile or two a year .
homo erectus asked the same tool about 30 generations of the way that we did .
you can teach you in the lab , a little bit of trade-offs , and there &apos;s actually a little bit of a time in other animals , but the exchange of an object against another is never happening .
it &apos;s the wealth of the own needs of saving time .
we &apos;ve achieved this as a species .
but there &apos;s no evidence for that .
and when people started doing objects like this , the way that they had a very much , it was a clue that a exchange between groups existed .
but who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
but that &apos;s because i &apos;m also because of the connections , and the people who are never there , and the other way of doing the ideas is to be able to face and to mate . i &apos;m sure that technology is going to continue to improve and
this is as high as a building building . i &apos;ve got the statue here as comparison .
but we don &apos;t talk about it , we don &apos;t take it seriously .
they &apos;re just gone , these feelings , they &apos;re gone .
if we think about the most sophisticated detection of flutes , usually the fast development is the problem because how can we discover things that constantly change ?
i &apos;ve talked about this -- you know , you know , if you don &apos;t manage to manage the hospital ?
what about real people ?
we sequenced one part of their viruses ; they were new , far , far , sweating .
after 10 more days , with fever of fever , she came back -- still in a fever -- she &apos;s got a little bit of oxygen -- little oxygen in your lungs .
it was not even very often sequenced .
it &apos;s a classic retrovirus , but it &apos;s completely new . nobody has seen it before .
a huge battery could do that .
so instead , we make something that is going to fit to the most profitable of the design .
i brought a little bit of a carbon arm with low density , a high density of salt below , and salt salt in between .
but david is young and clever and he wants to make a computer &apos;s license , and so he builds -- he builds the first metal battery with this chemical composition .
so what do we learn from all of this ?
this video was taken in the south of the coast , six kilometers before the coast of the street , about 20 meters below the surface of the sea .
so quickly , we realized that our garage was not big enough for this growing project .
i started to get to maria &apos;s and her methods and how they found this kind of thing and how important they found that children discover things themselves and they &apos;re not taught to be taught to be a kind of open kind of way to be taught to be
evolution is often seen as this one way we &apos;ve chosen , but it actually represents a huge number of possibilities .
i &apos;ll skip this to the stage of space space .
our cities are at risk because many of them are on the coast .
there are stars and so forth .
so if we think about the behavior of the behavior or your body language , how it &apos;s called social scientists , it turns out , so we think about communication . so we think about communication .
this expression , as proud of the pride , was studied by jessica tracy , and she showed that the divine people and birth of birth to the blind people , they do , if they win a little bit of winning .
so i thought about it . you find out on these people and see how they &apos;re involved . could you get them to do it and do it more ?
what happens to a computer program , what happens when you &apos;re going to be on the top stage , how the following little manipulation , these tiny little historians ?
this is happening in the lab . the little exercise , for just a few minutes , where you can really use it ? that &apos;s of course important .
these things . people are looking at their true , i show themselves .
she was completely depressed , and she said , &quot; i don &apos;t have to look for anything . &quot;
they need their bodies , privacy and two minutes , and it can affect the other way in the big way .
so , swimming swimming , to get to your body , and get a ant , and you get an ant , you &apos;re going to get into your brain and drive it up a blade of grass like a jeep .
and you have to have a kind of a kind of a design problem , you have to have an answer .
so it &apos;s like i think richard and i care that these ideas are not being abused .
and of course , they &apos;re essentially extinct in the first place .
but under all these ideas that are going to spread in the world , all of the toxic ideas are all the toxic ideas .
and as we should not try and eliminate it , they &apos;re not trying to destroy them .
and in my game , it &apos;s called the &quot; s . &quot;
we put some ideas on the legs , we went to tour international .
i know you &apos;ll tell me , &quot; t is not in music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
nobody hears each other . nobody knows the other .
you &apos;ll see the orchestra in a kind of a cauliflower .
i don &apos;t want to have to be that that shouldn &apos;t happen , but that we need to be better if it &apos;s about answering questions that you have to consider when you &apos;re going to think about the consequences and the reactions .
they work in government government . they &apos;re drivers .
five dollars can save life .
it deserves about two dollars a day , and it &apos;s just a little bit of a sudden , and i told you that they &apos;re not getting married even kids before these things are done .
finally , from despair , they went to a wise woman , and they were a wise woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , if you &apos;re angry , you &apos;ll be the best speech you &apos;ll ever be praying .
okay , the vast majority of us .
his message was basically unity , which is the connectedness of everything and the unity of everything , and his fundamental value was respect , was kindness to strangers .
who are going to fight while he goes ?
they start to go , in israel and palestine , in jordan , in turkey , in syria .
and so more and more , more and more , they &apos;ve been given a income , and they &apos;ve been a income for their family .
just go to somebody with another culture , from another country , with another ethnicity , who &apos;s kind of different and engaged in a conversation ; listen to him .
i start there where the story began , 1985 in the north states .
this morning , before they were doing the , who had the opportunity to invite you to a shower ?
you see here -- 35 percent of this less famous home , where 50,000 people live in people , had 35 percent of the houses , had a functioning shower .
21 percent of what we repair are follow by the signals , things that actually have been made around .
we did it . he did it .
we found out that in this region , failure is the main cause of diseases and death .
one thing is , in the context of everything we did , nelson mandela didn &apos;t far far from here : &quot; how slavery and apartheid is not a rotten thing ; she &apos;s the work of people , it &apos;s the work of people .
i &apos;m not worried about it if you call me a little bit of a time . it &apos;s not .
it sounds really , really , really , really , to say that from here , but if you try to use this , it &apos;s amazing to be effective .
and i &apos;m going to play on you , in which you believe that children shouldn &apos;t leave their community to live in a better way .
this is the youngest review of the minimum of the bronx in america with our main culture .
this is a picture of the bronx of the bronx who had the children who had been fed in his house , not in prison , so they felt like they felt .
we gave something back .
if you &apos;re big kids with small kids , they &apos;re the big , thick man in the middle , which is cool , and they create these accountability under the ground of the world that is incredibly , incredibly .
now you might wonder about these kids .
keep kids away from these stores .
stephen ritz : a teacher who &apos;s the south bronx
secondly , i bet that even you see the difference here , there &apos;s a increase in the world &apos;s terms of the very sharp line .
so , to cut 10 : last year , the pig suffered a heart attack .
people with migraine migraine who have an aura , have a band with nervous neurons -- here in red -- that &apos;s a minute to move three to five millimeters a minute .
the problem is that 30 million americans have migraine migraine , and we need a key problem . i think we have this now .
my first wish is that the most prolific computer is for epilepsy , the most prolific , for the most profitable , for the treatment of other people &apos;s treatment -- is used for the treatment of other people &apos;s treatment .
lawyers take cases in the hope of the hope of these obstacles in the hope of junk families who encourage the poor patients with pity .
a year ago , four of the five of the world &apos;s favorite classes were in ushahidi , by the way , called the &quot; aw &quot; .
how do you know what &apos;s really important about that ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i &apos;ve got the first time to get it to get it here .
these people are calling me a little bit of the barrier , because they &apos;re going to be excluded from the process , they &apos;re going to be able to share their knowledge with the world .
they have , in fact , to use armani as a platform to develop their materials and the design of the world , which teach around the world to teach teachers to teach the teaching .
yes , books , maybe 100 or 1,000 spending in the year will be sold .
it doesn &apos;t surprise it , right ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so that &apos;s not very hard .
the days of the oil revolution is over , when people say , &quot; well we &apos;d like to have three or a half of it in our country to see how this works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a rocket project . it &apos;s an education project .
you can use a couple of thousands of children with two .
so it &apos;s like a electronic book .
everybody says that &apos;s a $ 100 laptop that can &apos;t do it .
and that &apos;s the launch .
they click around things and stare at screens . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no . there &apos;s another better way . &quot;
we all play &quot; i love lucy &quot; on a big line , and we can &apos;t keep out of information and we can &apos;t keep up .
thank you .
i think most people think that a hiv-positive mother , still your child , is getting rid of your child .
that &apos;s not possible . it &apos;s not possible .
it &apos;s all good . they &apos;re going to live .
first , to prevent the most important thing .
two years ago , one of the mentor mothers came to me and told me a story .
how do you build a better healthcare system ?
the most important thing is , how simple the system is .
if you look at the volume of gray substance at the age of 4 to 22 years , it takes the story of the story , which shows this graph . it &apos;s the early age of the early youth .
the idea that your father was singing in public , and she was going to be a little bit more fond .
this is the most important thing we built together .
after the first year , it was invited by the divine emancipation museum in austria , to install it in his lobby and i &apos;m happy to say that there was a lot online , 24 hours a day , for almost nine years .
but in the night , while we were , i asked the tele-actor , how the most salient decided that they would kiss sam , that they would kiss sam .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place where my family has been working for four generations in the south states .
so , i have no idea what it has with shepherd &apos;s satisfaction , but they &apos;re hugely vulnerable .
the first thing you see in the most delicious is the terrible force of the brain &apos;s population .
he just just put it around my leg , picks me up , bring me to a vehicle and can bring me to a doctor .
it was a depression in the ground .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about you . &quot;
we have computing that 200 years the end of our direct world is the end of our direct world .
so it &apos;s so simple to see technology as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect as technology .
it &apos;s the most popular of my favorite .
i &apos;d like to think -- thank you .
and i can assure you : corn is in everything .
you should know that in every community , the number of the world &apos;s population is already rising .
i led three main classes in antarctica .
but tell me where they are and where they are . &quot;
we also explored the surface of the islands -- a very important tool for birds , one of the most important things in the pacific .
and we &apos;re as the rest of the world , a problem .
he coined the word &quot; reverse fishing . &quot;
of course , the most open and open seas were the open seas , but the most open sea , which everybody likes to look at was in trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific , huge carbon and huge plastic systems .
now there &apos;s a lot of time , immediate , automated , automated , accessible to many of our devices , even on the smartphone .
it &apos;s an endless debate , and there &apos;s no conclusions , no one answer . but if you &apos;re a big seller like me , you say , &quot; well , what are the data ? &quot;
instead , he &apos;s very carefully documented what happens again , when technology is first in a environment and in a community .
so there &apos;s , of course , two different ways .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a yves painting .
i mean , that was at least how i did happy .
now , there was a question of , of course , that i &apos;m going to put on a head in the head : well , can i do more of things that i like to do in design , and less of those who i don &apos;t like to
and here it is from the front .
they &apos;re a terrible situation without a way to go out .
they &apos;re being compromised in hospitals .
as a 15-year-old , for example , i was considered extraordinarily talented in the prison of the city , because i knew the most important thing about the way i &apos;ve got to use the design , and i know how to use the design of the game .
i saw this value of older people in so many of my friends who in their 60s , &apos; 70s , &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s still are active than a professional , farmers and nurses .
as a christian , and made out of the street , and made out of plastic salad , young men , young men in the united states and canada , who also went back to the bible .
the case of the world &apos;s last muslim oil organization , the last muslim .
the biggest evil , no , not , that these rocks are going to be a little bit more important , so he tries to stop it at the bottom of the day .
and one of my favorites is is a byproduct from yemen .
&quot; and , when does the article come out ? &quot;
so , it &apos;s got to be a little bit of a time that we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; &#93; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous when a group of itself identified itself as extremely .
rs : the humor of islam
let &apos;s look at it .
let me highlight it for you .
let me show you this here .
and when i started designing , i was discovering something odd about myself .
so they have the eye and then the concepts come to this .
but of course , china has a tremendous population .
but what this shows is that this kind of visualization is a form of information that &apos;s a form of the information .
it &apos;s actually a pleasure to engage with you because they &apos;re visual .
the main one is named after the eden project in britain .
why don &apos;t it smell like potato or a silver ? so there are two theories .
and a theory allows a less to work on a lot .
now after a few months of searching , i discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule that you call a handshake , and that &apos;s exactly the same vibration .
this is the basis for the device that made these two people built from ford .
they made it -- and it &apos;s got exactly like coumarin .
that was a good thing .
and at the time , a series of things that i &apos;m going to do is look at them .
and she had no idea of the context that she landed .
norman !
i didn &apos;t say anyone in a goodbye , neither of my mom , nor my father , not my sister , my brother , my brother , my cousins , my grandparents , no one .
i reports about this . i just reports about saying that i had two things when i left the orphanage i wanted to do . that was one , my family , to find poems and the other was to write poems .
and this is how we search after you .
and then you hope that one of us is flying around and little bits .
he had a computer company , and therefore , he has to be more resistant from other female , female and probably a lot of smaller family families to get his age from 12 years to reach .
is this a good evolutionary adaptation or will it lead to the most sophisticated way that we &apos;re going to be the most prolific species that exist on the planet earth ?
but will we do that or will we take nature to take their course ?
one day , a few weeks later , i was a year later , i was with my favorite trip in a shop for the training of the room , and i wanted to buy a little bit of a design plan .
this meant a fundamental change for me .
my score : about 70 layers of this , you have a little bit of the layers of water .
you know , how obsessed i really am ? this project is just for me , and yet i went so far to buy my head of a chinese newspaper from san francisco to get the bird to make it reasonable ...
when we were to go back to the very spectacular blue mountains in the west of sydney , it was a perfect criminal field : sunlight , the smell of the internet , and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you &apos;re ever going to walk again , only with a breathing machine . &quot;
i remember my father pushed me out on the wheelchair , and i was up to the bottom , and i felt the first time the sun was on my face .
they said , &quot; we &apos;ll be put to you next to you , because we think that &apos;s good for you . &quot;
she was going to take me a telephone card and i called the flight school , i was going to go and say i wanted to have a little bit of a life company .
and i said , &quot; aw . &quot;
and mom and dad ? never up up .
i &apos;m in this world , but i &apos;m in a instinctively dictionary .
it &apos;s like a nuclear being flying through a richard serra .
how to do the hell of the hell , i &apos;m going to make a phone in three weeks when i &apos;ve developed these things about millions of years ?
each one of these elements could be put on the wall as a kind of artistic object .
in his days , he was the highest passenger pigeon in british .
i look at a single day of the day , and how they flow -- how they stretch and flow . it &apos;s based on furniture , but it &apos;s not the most important thing . it &apos;s been made by aluminum and it &apos;s grown .
this is the car of the future . it &apos;s a water stamp .
if you ask it to contemporary architecture , it feels totally natural for me .
this is my studio . it &apos;s underground .
it was made of kevlar .
so , after i had done my dr. , i had the lucky fortune to be member of a child &apos;s first time using it to study the sea .
there was one of these most amazing things .
he uses red bioluminescence like a giant metal block to be a plastic company to be blind to animals , and can see it without being seen .
so they use it to eat and find partners .
i urge you to call another science that &apos;s still used hundreds of years old technology .
this is a magical place .
so i was going to rediscover the value of sleep .
and on june fifth , i heard a loud bang on the floor , which changed my life and the duck ended up .
and here &apos;s the duck again .
after the price , my life changed .
another example of the impact of the world &apos;s life is in the life of birds .
so , if i do something like this -- this is the sound for purple .
depending on how i &apos;m going to hear it , i can hear music with the food .
one of them is &quot; i have a dream &quot; by martin luther king , and the other is from hitler .
now , you can see more and more often , that the first is the first movement of law .
you don &apos;t want to say anything about it , which could be used against one . &quot;
absolutely crucial .
and what happens when teachers want to fix order ?
and why not ? you don &apos;t trust the law . why don &apos;t you trust the law ?
it &apos;s so that freedom has a structure of a structure .
because life is complex , and here &apos;s the hardest and biggest change : we need to have the authority for interpretation and application of law , and the officer is keeping the judges .
a free society needs red and green lights , otherwise it &apos;s going to be completely inclusive in a standstill .
and the limits for interest , the most important , can compute and for the price that you can take .
well , if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard to get out of the stairs with a ruler .
he paid a very bad job .
he only had a college company .
but the problem , on rules and incentives , is that they inhibit the professional activity , and they pollute the professional activity in two ways .
so smart , smart , is better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that any wise color of it can be upright for viral time .
why has this idea of spreading ?
people want to be more inclusive .
it was an extraordinary time . i &apos;m going to be a little bit more a bit more spectacular , which we &apos;re going to do -- america and the rest of the world .
this was a little bit of the turtle , the turtle .
we have a full set of thousands of things to do with this .
what i want to show you is what you need to get to 34 pounds high uranium .
what would have been if they had nuclear weapons ?
we come down and bring the trucks you just saw somewhere here in the back of the room .
part of the problem is that the most powerful self , they &apos;re overwhelmed by the thought of a nuclear disaster .
it was sent to me from somebody who &apos;s a college company who &apos;s a college company , and the fact is that america had hard .
there are many black sheep out there who do the wrong things , and the problems have even blown up .
we can show our results . we can make things better .
how can we tap them into them ?
it &apos;s a dangerous thing to have a dangerous working working .
imagine , we could , because if we could do it , we could achieve more .
governments who are doing most of the progress , they are governments who have found ways , shared value , in business , rather than seeing the government , which is the survival of the human condition .
maybe i can cut the brain , and i can see the brain , and i can change my cut .
i want to zoom in .
come on with me a moment to the 19th century , and it &apos;s just about 24 of the day .
we could certainly be all productive if facebook or twitter wouldn &apos;t cost us so much time .
they look at the british government , to get money for survival machines , because they believed that these machines were going to have tremendous practical effects for society .
these benefits didn &apos;t only have less wealthy men who were doing research , but they also upset them to look at the most important questions , rather than just answering the question .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i learned about life .
and once you start looking at the very small stuff -- this person wrote a whole article , and said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and all the old ones aren &apos;t old enough , they don &apos;t know how this infection happened -- which is that these intersections .
there are about 10,000 programs of this .
this would be the frequency of the people who could find the $ 26 letters of the subject in a random of random monkeys .
wherever life is , you have this distribution , unlike that distribution .
too hot , too hot .
the cop says , &quot; are you sure ? hey , you know , you &apos;re going to have that one ? &quot;
these are the data from a single survey to the only survey in zambia , from a few years ago , where i have a few years ago .
as you see , bruce willis had much more hair .
you could talk about 10,000 , 20,000 or 30,000 dollars if i had at all , or it was in my plan , and i didn &apos;t just have a ride in vacation .
instead of teaching people how to put the forms on the mobile phones , we should develop software that allows you to do that , without practice and without my favorite .
this is less than i did when i went to two weeks as a consultant .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , in life or in the balloon , we need to change the height .
this can be in spirituality .
and that &apos;s why they need weather .
i promised myself that i would take the next time when i would fly around the world , not to be a fuel , regardless of fossil power , to be sure , not by the most important .
i think you need a pilot in the airplane who can talk to the universities , who can talk to students during the flight of the office , and it can really make a human adventure .
and what is the goal ?
this is why all people who believe that are in this spirit , welcome to being part of this team .
now you just need one laptop .
anyway , for us , africa was a magical place .
the next thing i want to do is , what &apos;s the problem , what this problem is , and what it isn &apos;t .
this is crazy , really , if you think about it .
let &apos;s stop with a second with the nonsense .
the fact is that we can see the first generation , and this extreme poverty in the eyes , you see it over the ocean , tell it , and you &apos;re going to tell it . it &apos;s not to stand .
it &apos;s a nerves .
this year is a test for us , specifically for the leaders of the dotted states , who are and the history of the suburbs .
people find that slowly .
and with this one campaign as our chute , my organization , data , and other groups that are the energy and the enthusiasm of that there from hollywood to the harbor of america .
step forward , you go forward , a nurse , a teacher , a a tedster , and life will be saved .
the idea that the internet , which has changed all their lives , can change a country -- and a continent that it &apos;s just made to analog , let me just get the head out of the head .
lips are not lips , but volcanoes are .
now , your job is to recognize what this shapes is bouba and which is kiki .
now , if you &apos;re not just the same , this phrase , literally , is , literally , wrong .
if we &apos;re solving a problem or something new , we compare that to what we already know about , what &apos;s known to us .
nadia al-sakkaf : i &apos;m glad to be here .
they don &apos;t even fit to all these representations .
pm : i don &apos;t think that .
how do they handle them , they personally , but with their own favorite ?
some of my reporters are arrested .
this is clearly a different picture of yemen .
my heart was three times big .
this is a list of side effects : if you eat too much salt like a computer , and you &apos;re going to land a little bit of salt , you &apos;ll probably land on intensive care .
but soon i showed symptoms for the computer , and i had to go back to the street , knowing that i probably never would see my home .
i sat there and talked to the most little bit about the computer transplants , and i asked him what i needed when i needed a transplant , to do it .
i was sitting on a dozen machines holding me alive .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these is also one of these most amazing things in the united states , 200 percent .
also , interesting is that the same business that sold us 80 million pounds of atrazine , the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the antidote , &quot; also sold the antidote -- and the same company .
we also launched as a police designer .
what would our health care to us , if you were a day , when you were a day , and i had a little bit of a little bit of a sudden , some artificial folk , and a little bit of a half-life a.
the problem is that in my village , oakland , in most of our villages , are not seeing this connection .
here you see the accumulation of the national television station next to los angeles .
i offered five cents for every single day .
the main world can &apos;t be applied , it &apos;s become global .
here you see , in red , the spread of the ocean .
they &apos;re like a mouse watching the foot of a elephant , and the largest part of them are hidden in them .
they look out of their tree tree and they come from all directions around us .
redwoods have tremendous surface , which is expanding in the sky , because they tend to be something called the most controlled -- repetition .
so , the redwood canopy are giving the redwood stability , just like one cathedral , and help the tree , longer to live .
it &apos;s absolutely a tough thing to see .
but for recently , all doors are cut out of the palace and break the walls .
this was 25 years ago .
so , for example , let &apos;s take a look at the most important thing .
so , how do these people do these infected computers ?
and you can see it to see how we work -- how security works -- and try to find a way to find the most powerful , which we meet .
you &apos;ll notice that you can see a little bit down there , and you can see , you know , you can see , you know , you can open up the image of the computer , and you &apos;re going to put this image image on your computer
and if you look at the images of the scene , you can see that the appropriate thing is the ipcc &apos;s mark .
we have to find any way to make sure that everything is playing , even though computers are .
but i don &apos;t have to do anything .
this person around the world is in his own .
why should we believe what he says ? &quot;
how does his future look like ?
these forces disappear completely , no one &apos;s going to do that in 2011 .
it would be good if people were more mindful , and they would take these kinds of calculations seriously and participate in it because this would change things , but it would change things on two more types of ways .
that means that we see a copy of self when they &apos;ve used one part of the most of the most , that in slow and worse , and worse , and more unfortunate and more sophisticated .
and the happy few , jill and kevin , well , they came from their favorite door and saw that their video suddenly had spread like a giant video .
thank you .
you &apos;re going to go into the distant .
this is what he taught him to do since he was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had a mentor like mau , who taught me how to replicate in terms of comfort .
what is it that &apos;s going to drive you in life today ? not 10 years ago .
what do you do with what you &apos;re doing and you do it ?
didn &apos;t -- time . didn &apos;t have the -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager . didn &apos;t ...
in this moment , or unconsciously , in the moment you choose to focus on something you can focus on , you can make a sense of a meaning and whatever it means it &apos;s making emotion .
you ever have what did , and then you &apos;d go , &quot; that was me ! &quot;
to death . so , god in his infinite wisdom , we gave us another human need : uncertainty .
but this is true : we need it . we can do it through intimacy , through friendship , through prayers , through the motion in nature .
and there are seven different beliefs . i can &apos;t go through it , because i &apos;m through . the last element is feeling .
jewish man with a family in 1962 , someone in new york , who died when he was on the day at work , and this man who wanted to be a terrorist and he said , &quot; and it &apos;s quite clear . &quot;
instead , i &apos;m interested in developing tools with which one big number of people can tell their stories , people all over the world .
the color of the particles is the way that feeling -- happy , positive emotion , shining colors .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was the whole day on the computer . &quot;
and when i go over here , the list starts to run , and there are thousands of emotions that were collected .
the 10 themes of radiation from orbit and circle the time time .
it &apos;s called &quot; universe : unveiling of our modern mythology . &quot;
we can click this , and see this kind of iconic picture of betty ford , as she died the echo of her husband .
you can also look at quotes when you like to read quotes to climate change .
so people feel clouds as something that is in ways .
in life , they started to have tens of thousands of members in almost 100 countries all over the earth .
you just need one step out to go outside , and you think that &apos;s the way that it &apos;s so common , so that it &apos;s so common that all other people are missing it .
so look up , admire the gluten , and think of it , and think about the head in the clouds .
they would have 25,000 recordings , which would have been , &quot; the &quot; aw , good , good .
and you know , ten years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the most educated to buy my first ted company . it was a huge machine .
these images came from a virtual autopsy .
you can see , as the knife is mapped into the heart .
it &apos;s a little , mechanical pen , which has been very , very quick motors in its inner heritage .
now , this is a really interesting project .
so he does .
so , very gifted people .
i went to the kids so often as possible to get out to get the academic stuff with the real world in connection .
it &apos;s not all , but it &apos;s an incredibly empowering summary of everything we know about the basics of nature .
i &apos;m not going to go to the detail why we &apos;re going to imagine the universe , but it &apos;s made of mathematics and trying to explain the physics that we know .
but in my career , then , in my career , there &apos;s always something in me .
in 2001 , i visited her during a school center .
we got a lot of training .
this is what the first degree of the first degree is in 2004 .
he &apos;s a short degree of the most recently , and it was filmed recently with someone that you all know .
each one is being developed a hobby , but in different scientific disciplines .
i got my first computer as a teenager in accra , and it was a really great device .
he explores the brain using mri and he said this is the most beautiful brain he ever got .
and i &apos;m going to show you the next few slides that i &apos;m going to show you .
transistors are getting smaller to allow us to make the technology better .
our main system is behind this lens .
i had such a gut feeling that we &apos;re wrong with it .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so we know what a radius is .
i like to call them the most important of the design of the world , because they &apos;re kind of like a little bit of a time .
we can see more detail in our galaxy , and we can see somewhere else .
and that brings us a factor of 20th .
so there was a bunch of alternative to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff there .
it pulls out a lot more than the other and the cloud is drawn apart .
and i hope that i &apos;ve convinced you at least that we have a really , really , a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy .
one day i was in the streets of new york and saw some children between stairs , cars and fire clothes .
so for example , people were doing pieces of pieces that were happening that way .
in the first eight centuries of this tradition , the big &quot; what &quot; in it , god , to appreciate and prices .
and by new and improved instruments , the age of the ape broke .
but a question is : what happens when the music stops ?
michael libeskind thomas : music and feelings in time
we &apos;re at the beginning of a new school project .
until 1945 , they brought it on 100,000 years .
so i &apos;m going to talk about the news of the day , although i don &apos;t know where to start .
wow , a volunteer , great !
but recently , my interest was to look at a new view of big amounts of crowds because there are conditions where they can actually make this cool .
well , i think this is the latest development of a phenomenon that we call &quot; sympathetic innovation . &quot;
but the element of desire is really the most important thing .
we get a fabulous talk of them back .
let me introduce you to this point sam .
but even if you take the screen back , there &apos;s a lot more than just words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
how do global innovation promote global innovation ?
first , i have to make a service of the audience a service and talk about what i &apos;m going to give him , rather than saying what i &apos;m not going to offer .
and that they &apos;re fun to design their own , ultimate , ultimate or worst tedtalk .
now , you can &apos;t compare them to each other .
they keep them alive and give them the sugar , so one kind of a kind of a kind of a design that we &apos;re going to predict .
this kind of tests are used , ok ?
somebody asked , &quot; why ? &quot;
the thought he thought he could reverse the waves . he couldn &apos;t .
i think there are three big changes , and in the areas of transparency , choice and accountability , where people have really power .
how do we do that ?
my favorite , sharon , yo &apos;s , says , on the world , more photos of your head than anyone else .
11 countries .
and secondly , teachers were looking at the most sophisticated and more sophisticated ways of being compromised , because they took in specific terms of reference , where a private sense is a sense of faith .
so , i wish all of a nice weekend .
dna to read and write , and it &apos;s going to be more easy and cheaper .
the canadian work alone .
now you might ask yourself , &quot; what would i do in a college program ? &quot;
if you have all the world &apos;s stuff , this can lead to a plastic system , which is allowed to do biotechnology .
the kingdom says , its laws allow him to communicate , strangers , or a risk of economic risk or a risk of health or a risk for health or values .
these laws are a blow in the face for science and based on prejudice and ignorance and a delivery of traditions and a worthy of a foraging pattern .
why are you going to be pregnant when you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of 10 hundred thousand people who inject drugs .
so that social worker , the condoms that are releasing condoms to endangered infections , not even are being tracked by the police , called or randomly locked in .
here were kids born , people died there .
office office for personal work are now obsolete .
they &apos;ve reached the high line , the road , the road , the river underneath the street , and you get from a end to the other , without crossing the air .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny apartments . &quot;
also , jobs should be shared .
their liver is completely crude oil .
and they killed about 12,000 sharks at the time by actually wearing a very , very only one of the most prolific in the bay bay bay bay .
we know very little about them .
so this tag is found out of a shark , depending on time and the sunset , the water and depth .
let &apos;s look at the arable sea , which is what &apos;s going on with the genes that are passed up from parents , then we see that basking sharks , compared to the first study , have a factor of 10 times less diversity than other people &apos;s disease
so , thrilled , and i found this research , and found that the size of the size is the only to be 9,000 .
and what was okay . we got wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build . &quot;
so if we can tell the gender of the shark before we take a sample , we can say the geneticists , if they were from a male or females .
so i decided to give myself the norwegian administration .
their bodies are broken off with the water , and they &apos;re being used for any kind of a little bit of the time to make money -- people tell themselves a lot of these stories .
no business with no one .
my journalism may not fit in other continents or in other countries , in my part of africa , but it works . it &apos;s about corruption , questions , asking people , &quot; where are the evidence ?
aa thank aa beautiful .
i was raised in downtown manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks removed from the radio coast of the u.s. war .
i wouldn &apos;t be reading as a designer .
and had these people ever realized a victim of their favorite of their favorite ?
today , in 29 states , you can be fired in more than half of the country because of its sexuality .
at some point , i realized that my mission was to photograph gay , because there was a million different kinds of people who were gay .
at least i hope that it &apos;s going to be more difficult to get your human rights .
first , the world is , and it &apos;s always going to contain good and evil , because good and evil , yin and yang are the most prolific .
and third , i had access to all 1,000 pictures that had made the soldiers .
three ways : the conventional way is that it &apos;s called the world &apos;s face .
this is stanley turing , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he said , &quot; could the holocaust happen , here &apos;s the holocaust story , here ? &quot;
&quot; my lord , who is responsible if it happened ? &quot;
stanley tan and i closed both 1954 , the high school , at the james ridge in the bronx .
here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
the other one . the other thing .
alexander libeskind says that the border between good and evil is going to be a human heart .
and i put this experiment on the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what everybody could do , &quot; no big thing to jump on the tracks .
it &apos;s a mystery that really was very difficult to start .
we have a self .
but on my left retina , a computer is a very , very clear thing that &apos;s labeled through the red arrow .
there &apos;s only an reference point , which is the body .
i promise i don &apos;t say anything , except that it should be scary .
and the autobiographical self has extended memory , thinking , imagination , creativity and language .
thank you . thank you for sunday sunday -- and blogging hill .
now i &apos;m telling you this -- i &apos;m telling you , and i &apos;m enjoying it , i think , the feminism , because i think feminism has partly been the task , suggesting the aesthetics , and beauty and fun .
we don &apos;t want a hero .
you can see , i don &apos;t put myself on fire .
she talked about the design of the , she founded the design , she organized it , she was making friends -- all these daily actions of the care and creativity .
i mean , it &apos;s that these trade-offs that homo sapiens are different from former .
in fact , this is a sensor for brainwaves that reads the electric activity in my brain while i think that talk .
we &apos;re making a lot of prototypes and products to live with thoughts that you can control with thoughts , like thought-controlled appliances , or a floating chair .
the headset is wireless with a ipad or a smartphone .
how these kids can use their new consciousness to their recovery , a lot of the more harmful and more sophisticated social communities are turning around , which people are diagnosed with as a different one , to see .
they understood the power of human narrative and that the value we &apos;re going to do on humans changes , changing , and growing .
and said , &quot; how are you going to celebrate ? &quot;
my skills and my opportunities .
temporary , and it was a very unexpected , they gave them .
this specialist didn &apos;t take a look at my eyes .
i walked a track that i know .
and very slowly , it happened .
i didn &apos;t really believe in my own , not all of the stocks of me , all the little people in all of us .
that &apos;s me . my whole thing .
what we have is exactly the same thing , the same activity , but at one of them , they feel great , and at the other , with only one small change in attitude , they feel terrible .
but i think it &apos;s another debate that has to take place that goes to control , which we have about our tax tax .
for the percent of this money , you could have been able to install the air in the breaks , which would not have reduced the duration of the journey , but what the pleasure and the output would have improved .
i &apos;m not asking for the full priority of one about the other .
sometimes the lines are very , very long .
i think the danger in the world today is that the field of economics is understood as a function of economics as a function of human psychology .
the average answer to 50 percent would be going to be about 50 percent .
it will be more sinister , you don &apos;t care yourself , other hurt .
yay !
they &apos;re 20 , 30 years back .
but that would not mean i have a coin with a head on both sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but this is our skin of the visible universe .
thank you .
with hyperscore , we had to be good , actually very strong effects in children around the world , and now in humans every hour .
it &apos;s a man , rich , successful , powerful , who wants to live forever .
hello . my name is dan atwood . i &apos;m 34 years old , and i have cerebral circles .
this is actually the score of dan &apos;s piece that he &apos;s completely held in hyperscore .
odysseus said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do a little bit of a sudden .
there &apos;s a time first time .
i have to write five pages a day for articles , or i had to give five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that this is going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you is the last one of the time projects , is something that i &apos;ve created with hal , who &apos;s introduced me from my co-author at a previous project , bill sharpe .
it &apos;s pretty good that it &apos;s not affecting people , because if one of the faces smiles , the other face is paralyzed .
this is one of the reasons that so much of what we think of western science , math and engineering , actually in the first few centuries of our food programs , the most powerful , and the most powerful .
x is the unknown , because it doesn &apos;t exist in the spanish .
so it &apos;s not that if you talk about mental illness , you probably have stories of the brain &apos;s suffering , shame and discrimination in almost all the life systems .
something more than 30 years ago , the nations in the world was in the world in the world , and gave the legendary explanation off .
what &apos;s it going to be ?
if you look at the level of the species , you &apos;ve heard about fish .
and you look at these profit , you see that almost 8,000 of these dollars are actually subsidies .
that was in the early croton , when india wanted to be driving his head of energy -- as a tool to the recovery -- to china , after his alibi growth of eight , nine , 10 percent and asked , why can &apos;t we ?
it &apos;s not going to be able to do it in a happy way , but they have trust and the courage to say , &quot; we have computing .
green carbon , so the emissions , the emissions , and agriculture , and blue carbon combined together , 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it to win .
i didn &apos;t know what these things would seem like , dick , not -- sydney &apos;s .
i also liked intellectual health .
and he said he was essentially the same relationship to his father .
there was a theory .
he did again .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t move in the course of the experiment , they don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed the whole thing , and the color color , which is just a fantastic aluminum filter .
many of these ideas are going to be made into the trailer for airstream .
if you think about it , your children in tinkering school will come to the tinkering school , and you &apos;ll come back with a little bit of time , and you &apos;re in constant , and you &apos;re in denial .
but let &apos;s play them under their own conditions , and trust me , they will learn things that they can &apos;t learn from the most of the time .
if you want to throw a device next to you , you don &apos;t do it .
i think that &apos;s all . this is a number five . okay .
so here you see the sick knee on the left , and here my wife at the shooting , and here &apos;s my wife walking to aspen , and in aspen , and in good constitution .
how about a completely valid , not just the sharing ?
this is one of the seven times more sophisticated , which is not the only one that &apos;s been shot in all the .
and so , in the years of rehab , in the year of the western europe , we started to buy thousands and thousands , then hundreds of thousands and then millions of individuals , and then , you know , get tens of thousands and a half of the
but how do our imagination work ?
but we never think about the hidden connections .
when edison was invented the light bulb , she saw about this .
you have to be right , and even though i don &apos;t have a college tank , it doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m stupid , because you can &apos;t be stupid today , and it &apos;s going to be a lot of time in the world .
they literally have the door of the door .
if you listen to the most prolific listening to your body , both ears are both told .
we have the problem that the antenna is actually vibrating .
thank you very much .
and from this reason i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and the most important .
recently , i &apos;ve created some pretty sophisticated research projects from the undersea bison .
and i drew her own special card , and i wrote her name on it , and i wrote her name , and send her .
i &apos;m sure i can see how you &apos;re going to be a little bit more fond .
and i believe that it &apos;s a little bit of time , my valuable and limited life on this earth that is just so much more sophisticated .
in this mode , he tries to hold his position .
i thought i &apos;m a little bit of a bit of a time to tell nature .
we &apos;re going to think of future technologies . we start in the beginning of the world .
and if you see it , you see the amino acids with the most important , which you have different charges .
and through a series of glass , you can get one billion , which is what you want to do , like a battery or a solar cell .
in this case , you see that there &apos;s a lot of time coming out .
if you ask people to ask the question : where do you go to do something important ?
i sat at my desk , i used my expensive computer .
what happens -- sometimes you have this days , which you wake up at eight o &apos;clock in the morning or seven or when you just stand up and you say , man , i don &apos;t really have a good sleep .
in the office , most of the uninterrupted and distractions are actually keeping people from work , participants .
we all know that this is true . they would never experience a spontaneous meeting that employees will meet .
meetings and managers are now the two main problems in companies , especially in offices .
maybe every single week , or every week , once the week , the week , no one &apos;s going to talk about .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m going to do this now seven years and have no idea how the future will look .
but if you ask people to say the three important things they &apos;re wearing , whatever culture , which is gender and what context -- most people say : key , money , and if you own one , the mobile phone .
but , and this is a very big but , but we have the tendency to forget .
now , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
you take 10 or 20 percent of your body , and then the owner of the stock takes 10 or 20 percent of the body , and there &apos;s the rest of the bar on the bar .
it challenges the norm .
and he somehow has a recognition of the values of the sequence .
at the same time , with the spread of these mobile devices , we see an expectation of availability .
our current reality is less interesting than the story we &apos;ll tell later about it .
what are we talking about ?
dean ornish shares new research research that shows how the educational challenges are capable of a human life , and he says , if we live healthier , better food , sport , and more , we &apos;re actually putting our brain cells together .
until i tell you who said it .
within this context , we can obviously feel regret about many different things .
when i went home , after i got my tattoo , i stayed almost all night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s another fifth .
i mean , even the dumb answer to all of us can let us get back days to do a little bit .
and as i said , i &apos;m a college company .
i thought i would try to try to be present to my ted wish , which i try to achieve , and how this is what they &apos;re trying to achieve .
no one in india . now there &apos;s at least half a million active .
and i came up with the idea that somebody in this whole ngo must think about the organization of the world &apos;s organization .
and so we did that .
listen to this : less than four tenth of one percent of that , they stopped the way they &apos;re treated , and they &apos;re going to be a drug .
it &apos;s a try to do it , and i think it would be successful .
the desks are not square .
when the counter tag is used , it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity . day and night .
and people get their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , with green school .
the other health of the city of bali cooking is eating the food on the ground and they use secrets that only know their grandmothers .
we need somebody who comes and studied it .
the green school is a model that we built for the world .
my tongue , voice and vocal vocal , were healthy and not to promote . &quot;
then apple brought alex , the best voice i &apos;ve heard of .
there was one reason that i was .
the most important thing is , of course .
but it &apos;s not about that .
at first , the internet was a computer tool for me , and now it &apos;s something i &apos;m going to leave my real , daily life .
it &apos;s human to ignore disease .
they all know the test for artificial intelligence , the landfill .
i was an architect , and my grandmother asked me , &quot; what do you live ? &quot;
we treat two main pages as a single side , because it &apos;s the way the readers take true .
so what is the lesson behind ?
but one day , my grandmother said , &quot; no , this time you &apos;re going to walk .
it happened to me and terrible things happened with me .
all lost the hope in my cure .
so they went to their office and all they collected their teammates -- they gave me pots and the pottery , and they were making a bomb , all of them .
you don &apos;t know how far away that road is , and you don &apos;t know if you go straight and you hear cars and you &apos;ve got a horrible accident , and you &apos;ve had a horrible accident that you &apos;ve brought in this situation .
i thought that some reason was there , and only for family and friends was cut .
for example , the understanding of molecular structures .
he took me to the most popular of the computer .
can we say we were all discovering the symmetries of the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t turn it down because i &apos;ve made a little barrier , right ?
if i put a magic ride on it , and then it &apos;s a third .
galois has set up a series of laws for how these tables , these symmetries , interact .
so , one of these is what we call a symmetry .
instead of all , all of the confusion , i want to know how many digits have the number . ok ?
i need your name . symmetrical objects , basically -- please spell it for me .
first , worse nutrition , maybe shorter .
thomas edison would have been very fond of software today .
penicillin was discovered in 1946 , but even in 1940 , there were no commercial and medical conditions made of it .
it was the origin of the design , which had the 50th anniversary of his 50th birthday .
for me , the lesson of unintended consequences is that chaos is happening now . let &apos;s do the best thing .
it works with every computer and browser , minus minus , minus , minus the text , is smaller .
they don &apos;t need to delete them extra .
and so , a kind of information , which i &apos;m inspiring to make my real desk .
a means that it would be like a little bit of a design , so you get more traditional desktop , and the things are on grid .
now i &apos;m going to get the heart of people and there &apos;s no boundaries .
but i think the point is , it &apos;s metaphor with bite , and with such a bite , i want to suggest that we &apos;re going to be a bit of the role of contemporary mathematics , not just the only thing that we think of , but math
and he said , &quot; well , there are 2,000 physicists on wall street , and i &apos;m one of them . &quot;
you can find them here : this is a book about flies that you might have on amazon .
these are not a poor ; that &apos;s culture .
you can get it very , very far .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s actually so interesting .
go . shake . uh !
i want to tell you a secret .
so , intersections without traffic lights , so with stop , save many lives , but there &apos;s a permanent hybrid of them .
the answer is to allow cars to get the car from the street .
warren buffet had suggested that , frankly , to say what works and what &apos;s not going to do and to make a annual thing .
in fact , in the process of the social , it &apos;s the only known disease that we &apos;ve been having , because of the most amazing , in africa , people have even been given several things to avoid the design system .
this means that the economy in these areas is being avoided because it &apos;s just so much stopping .
but there &apos;s no way that we have a real time .
not just it was weak ; she &apos;s weaker .
a teacher of the top quartile is going to be the performance of his class -- measured in a year about 10 percent .
but it &apos;s not a relationship in any relationship to be a better teacher .
&quot; what happens here ? &quot;
and these free courses may not be available in the internet , but you can also make dvds everywhere , so everyone with access to a very promising teacher can have the very best teachers .
traditional vessels , like this cup , need eight to 10 hours to burn .
the sculptor richard serra talks about how he thought as a young artist , he was a painter and he lived in florence .
if i look at these photos , i got back to the smoke , and i went back to my clothes when i went home at my family .
my parents were great . they said , &quot; we know you &apos;re afraid , but let &apos;s just go tomorrow .
but is it so bad to keep us so powerful ?
this is a percentage general in boston .
the presumption takes the sample , it &apos;s a , it &apos;s a , you study it , it &apos;s under the microscope and then the operating room .
so in this process , a solution with this cliche molecules , together with a dye , shown green , is actually being represented in the brain of a cancer cell , can &apos;t separate normal tissue these molecules .
with a little bit of the nodes as part of our current nodes , the surgeon is looking for the individual node , the lymph node , where cancer begins .
if nerves are damaged , they can cause mosquito debris , and pain .
if we &apos;re going to have these two samples of dna .
we know that this is doable and we &apos;re determined to realize this .
and this cell is one of the thousands of different types of water that we learn .
it will affect the common circuits as the sick , which they want to fix .
and one morning in 2004 , we tried it , and it &apos;s been working on the first time .
we &apos;ve shown that already a short circuit of these cells is enough to drive the learning .
and it &apos;s going . now .
i want to end with a story that we think might find clinical application .
now you can see that the animal actually is going to be able to put the walls and can use the little platform and use his eyes .
buildings are a regulated with the microbes in the air , which are chemical , and over the window , over the window .
and if you &apos;re out there , the air contains microbes that are associated with the general and the bottom of the world .
obviously , i &apos;m a very powerful person , as you see , so i didn &apos;t worry about that thing , that thing , 20 blocks far .
the same thing for the question , who after 9 / 11 are the streets in my neighborhood ?
and you can get a list .
one of these things that i &apos;ve been experimenting with is something called google share , basically you just take a abstract term and look for google , and then you look at this event after the name of someone .
that &apos;s britney spears . i mean , ok , interesting .
if you have the second side here , most of you link .
what all of us were normal about 40 years ago -- telling stories between generations -- is now rare .
in 1939 , the film was older than most grandparents of our members .
was the story good ?
why don &apos;t we see that with the same passion as the reading ?
in california , they will send into a logarithmic note : &quot; this product contains chemicals that are the state of california as a cause of cancer , and the state of cancer and other people are seen . &quot;
so maybe we could develop a more sophisticated , which requires humility , and for my job as an architect , it &apos;s a bad thing that the words &quot; humility &quot; and &quot; architect &quot; hasn &apos;t been mentioned in the same section .
i don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was , &quot; the stone stone didn &apos;t end because we ran the stones . &quot;
and that can be very well for berlin , but we found in houston , and all the windows were closed , and with all the products that obviously didn &apos;t have to use the use of money in money , that &apos;s actually a vertical solo .
if we look at the word competition , i &apos;m sure most of you use it .
since then , we &apos;ve taken the 4,000 people most most frequently most common in a database that we &apos;re going to put in six weeks of public .
now we have 160 pounds of heavy mellon , the most powerful in the internet .
we started to engineer commercial and mixed structures from buildings so that all people have centers and places where they can stop .
and this is the most salient thing in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . let &apos;s tell you that we knew that we knew all that , because we didn &apos;t know .
for example , they give that the most important thing in microsoft at september 11th started in 2007 , at the yahoo 12th 2008 and then the other : google , facebook , skype , skype and so on .
i &apos;ve chosen sweden because sweden is similar laws , like the united states .
and who also tells you , he didn &apos;t have to hide it for a long time .
their email were read and talked to them in the office , and said , &quot; if there &apos;s no right on privacy , it can &apos;t give you a real speech , and therefore no effective democracy can be . &quot;
many people , if you &apos;re first seeing a fresh human brain , say , &quot; normally , it looks different if you can get a brain . &quot;
all these empty areas , they &apos;re the areas where the elements go through .
and the nature of a particular cell , to basically argue about the operators is that it &apos;s turned on to which 25,000 genes are turned on and to which the threshold is turned on .
now experts are going to come into the game and make basic anatomical imaging .
we &apos;re taking this material and put it on a call called the &quot; laser effect . &quot;
so what can scientists learn from these data ?
they &apos;re looking at their entire genomes and they try to find the most important thing that &apos;s connected to genes .
whether that &apos;s the individual genetic background , or your experience depends on it .
that we know how to eradicate poverty , we need to do more for that ?
so here &apos;s a couple more questions .
how do you know ?
so what is the problem ?
well , all right , it was all the same .
and it was made a lot of experiments that all came to the same conclusion , so i &apos;m just going to talk about one .
so what &apos;s the best thing ?
we need this kind of information . we need more of it , and we need to drive the politics .
and maybe we start small , with things where we are safe , that they work .
poverty is more irrelevant than scientific work and a lack of data about the effects of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost , but esther esther duflo is able to figure out what the controls and the damage -- with help with
so we start , because africa is in a certain way of what we &apos;re beginning to understand .
and the legend was reported that alexander was walking through this desert .
but you could say , &quot; invest in africa with 1,000 languages , and it would not move . &quot;
so let &apos;s look at the countries , and the specific materials and data .
i want to talk to this from the human capital capital .
in tanzania , last week of standard was called the standard of the standard .
if i &apos;d have to ask you , &quot; what was the most common thing in 2005 with the world &apos;s best performance ? &quot;
because there are fascinating ways .
&quot; god &quot; is the journey that we &apos;re all trying to be inspired to be inspired and feel about the universe , which celebrate life .
you &apos;re going to go to a switch -- there &apos;s electric light .
i don &apos;t know why , but they thought .
i &apos;m going to run that to you so that you can sort of pick up the way and i &apos;ll describe my reactions when i &apos;ve seen the first time .
right .
ok , move , raise the right hand .
kt : yeah .
kt : no , no . i just see on the street .
i couldn &apos;t see through the blindfold .
again , gone back .
kb : how often did you feel that ?
let &apos;s close your eyes , in five , four , three , one .
just when you want the pressure released , you make a laser ring , so , but only if you want the pressure down .
do you want to try it ?
you know , you know , a certain sense of emotion , and if you feel the emotion , i want you to throw the water off into the bottle .
there &apos;s one thing that i want to share with you .
ready ?
my hand is , here , in the middle of the street .
kb : ok . do you think he &apos;s here , yes or no ?
first of all , keith barry , how our brain can be able to make our bodies -- with a trick of the same thing , and then he refers to the audience in some incredible scales of brain magic .
i &apos;m going to be embarrassed .
this is not for the one of four . this is for all four .
i watched that both religious people are equally obsessed with morality .
the most powerful is almost at zero , if there &apos;s no stimulation to the process .
and then you get the message from the computer : &quot; person one has sent these many money .
we showed that the gift of oxytocin is increasing generosity to the 80 percent of the dna .
i just found the molecule .
he asked me , &quot; what should we do ? &quot;
experiments have a lot of testosterone .
and that tells us that we invented this ritual to connect us with this new couple of emotionally .
and it &apos;s very easy to encourage a brain to be nurturing .
to get the device to run the device , you need a lot of people .
or should you not do that ?
they said quite a bit , &quot; you &apos;ve given us a device that works only on english , so we taught ourselves english so we can use it . &quot;
i decided to destroy my own argument by making a kind of a startling statement .
absurd . but i had to follow the victorian norm .
how does this tomorrow be ?
we have to reverse this imbalance , from threat to pleasure .
i think it &apos;s right here in the focus .
i asked quite incredible questions -- &quot; when was the beginning of the world ? how will it end ? &quot; in nine-year-olds .
and only one last thing .
maybe we should go to the next piece , because i just lost the thread .
he went to the local airport in uttar pradesh and found that he was running in the official papers as died .
so this is the area of a space .
non-zero-sumness is in the privileged layer , which is able to pay multiple levels of data and to get several households , physically .
after these four children , you see the young sister , which is their children who are killed , who are killed .
and finally , there was a single one who was sitting for me and later his participation , so i had to put him out of it , so he was going to be able to get it out .
with 16 , the kids have to leave the orphanage , even though they can &apos;t go .
one of the interesting things of course is the combination of the naked hand on the instrument and the technology , and of course , what he said about listening to our young people .
now my career could continue to continue .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
from him , the sound comes from the chamber .
or we do this , and we believe that &apos;s what blindness is .
rain . not bad . not bad .
and what do you do ? but why can &apos;t i do that if i learn a piece of music ?
in this case , the dove shows the dove , the dove , evelyn glennie , why the music is much more than sound waves to be made of the audience .
and it became so big until the point where it was a last year at heathrow , and in the last year , and rick &apos;s thanksgiving , and rick fermi , and &quot; the millions of people in television . &quot;
but that &apos;s not the interesting thing .
cp : you have lucky to transmit it to you .
peace and love were mentioned .
cp : yeah , but you still don &apos;t know what to think of it .
this is 10 times longer than the mammals needed to reach their height and to maintain all of these habitats .
we look at dinosaurs , and we &apos;re unusual in our aroma , and we &apos;re in our aroma .
it &apos;s basically a country that has no way to do our work .
this is an adult village in his jaw .
paul never sees a fossil so that he &apos;s a fossil speaker .
these are all the things that are all about . there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
i became artists and started drawing .
the question is -- and we &apos;re talking about this question for centuries -- how to deal with this kids in science .
bad news for derartu tulu , though -- some other reports had the same idea , below the olympic coast and paula radcliffe , which is an incredibly , very the fastest , the fastest of all time .
show me an animal with a little bit of gills and gills , and then it has a little bit of water .
we don &apos;t have our physical strength , because we &apos;re the largest largest environmental capacity in the jungle .
now , emily atwood -- one of 500 people and reporters -- they end up looking at the best 10 , even though they &apos;ve done all the time to keep their baby to quiet -- and to defeat their baby &apos;s heads .
that &apos;s all we could .
but maybe it &apos;s different .
now , stop putting the focus on these kinds of neurons where you have failed , if you take four hours .
in the math math , it was always about interacting with things , not with people -- not to a social species , which is of course , for us , and the people really help us accept robots as part of our daily life .
cookie monster is very , very bad .
the youngest was a experimenter from our group , in which they used three of three different technologies to interact with the participants .
and with this technology , you can become the active participants in your grandchildren , in a way that it &apos;s not possible today .
and the third way was a simple journal with paper and pen , because this is the most important thing you used when you start to get a design program and program program .
another important idea is this notion of the design of the character .
i have style , laughing , see real hard because it &apos;s not a fairy tale , but it &apos;s a little bit of a time to be a mustache n .
walking away , not far . i &apos;m going to fire : &quot; bang ! &quot; the damn falls between two more delicious cars .
when he wrote on a wooden factory , i was the door .
i &apos;m going to show a number of photographs and movies , but i also do a little bit of advertising , books and a little bit of advertising , with the same concept .
from photography , this is the most important thing , they &apos;re making desire and they &apos;re making desire and they don &apos;t want to do that , you want to do more .
as you &apos;re in the collective consciousness , it &apos;s not that we know that at all , and how it happens .
it &apos;s very commercial .
and then you change the photo that he &apos;s taking , and suddenly it &apos;s pretty serious and maybe less accessible .
85 percent of global health care for cardiovascular disease is in developing countries -- not in the west -- and yet 90 percent of the means in the west .
just to treat . look at the situation in the island of mauritius .
but if you tell them , well , we &apos;re trying to make the same in nigeria , all the fort continues .
it allows the existence to be able to use the centers , and we can use the experience very smart .
prevention has to be part of the solution -- that &apos;s important .
and we start a technology map of technical program so that we can make local people that can repair the equipment .
autism has a very large range of very massive -- the child doesn &apos;t develop language -- until the brilliant scientists and engineers .
i love the film , like you all have my projects , and that &apos;s the mainframe in me .
now , what i learned early because i was not so social , and i was not myself to sell myself .
another thing is the sensory problems .
in other words , a problem with the equipment of a plastic network .
the movie of francis &apos;s called &quot; the name of &quot; christ . &quot;
i made a little bit of the food shop during the office , and i built things and learned how to do tasks .
another very important idea is to let kids come from some of the many in the national / 80s , and let them do a lot of the time .
tg : i have passion for that , that things i do , the world i do .
it &apos;s a extended reality , the projections can follow and link systems , or just a digital storyteller .
the fifth time i &apos;m standing on this coast , the cuban missile , i look out on the far horizon and faith , again , that i will do it all the way across the long , dangerous wilderness of a ocean .
but it was deeper : how much life is there ?
and then there &apos;s our food system , that you never really tell me how far it is , we don &apos;t know how far it is .
but honestly , all of these talks i had to criticize just to make the most easy to make the design , they were very different .
thank you very much and fun at the conference .
and that &apos;s perhaps the most important thing , he lost your self-esteem .
he &apos;s going to be the army . the army gives him a rifle .
so what happens when a medium is suddenly bringing a lot of new ideas in circulation ?
they had to synchronize them quickly , what other natural philosophers knew , and otherwise they couldn &apos;t have the right kind of discussion .
but there was a programmer that decided that that wasn &apos;t the best way of doing work .
each of them can do changes and they can overestimate them to the top of the work , even though they knew nothing about the existence of each other .
this is called a &quot; a &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the right thing right here . &quot;
something significant , which can happen to a culture , is that you can acquire a new color of the world : you can see , you know , it &apos;s a new color problem , you know , right ?
don &apos;t try to do what other people do , a little bit better , because it doesn &apos;t get very far .
and if someone says you can &apos;t , you don &apos;t hear it , then you don &apos;t hear it .
six to nine months to the best time .
but we &apos;ve tested this rover before we &apos;ve been testing it , before we &apos;re going to get it out there -- or this one rover -- and we have sure that everything works .
so we have a space probe on the road to mars , called phoenix . this probe is going to land in 17 days , seven hours and 20 seconds , and so you can put your clocks .
and that would be bad .
we &apos;re in the process of designing the next rover that we want to send to mars .
and i know many of you have been doing this , that these are really cool things .
there were two satellites that were particularly interested in us .
it &apos;s like the cycle on earth , but because it &apos;s so cold , it can &apos;t be water , because water is frozen .
today i want to talk about how these exponentially emerging technologies are emerging .
so let &apos;s see how exponentially grow technology affects health care .
this is an example of this kind of puzzle .
there are wireless things .
and i think many of these technologies are going to help us be connected to our patients , and to take us more time , to focus on the important , human elements of medicine , which are being augmented by this kind of technology .
but the current trend in medicine is to be more , more likely .
and let &apos;s come up with genomics , when the first human being did the first human health company , was the cost of a billion dollars .
thank you for websites like the sound of wine or the consumer &apos;s health of your data on the ground , or google health , it will always be more important , all these possibilities on a kind of a fire form .
we used the cells from the bone marrow to treat a patient with heart attacks , and we realized a more powerful and higher one that was concerned with the use of the own brain cells to a heart attack .
my poem is called &quot; landfill . &quot;
your cats , god knows how many people clap on their own , their spikes , their spikes , a water loop .
how you cross the tiles , at the stage , to the street , to the street , not looking at me , &quot; can you help me ? &quot;
i was afraid of a piece of mine , except control , and i would be caught in the shocking of her favorite , and i was always caught in the shocking side of her favorite .
but i &apos;m afraid that the coming from me and i &apos;m going to show his own .
if we love , they hold me around , i &apos;m there , i &apos;m there , not there .
we look for images that are going to drive attention to critical topics , images that are the most important ones that are , the religions are going to cross us , and do something to do with other words : to act up .
in &apos; 80s , the stigma was a tremendous obstacle to discuss this disease , or to mention it , or just mention it .
jonathan klein : photos that changed the world
i had read a lot of books , and i was studying the data and the design company .
i could see the flag in the stick of the stick , and i &apos;m going to be -- ah , a little bit of a sudden , and the music went to a plastic center .
finally , the morning of the day of the day , we got the most educated thing , we got the helicopter -- two helicopter in the field of the ice -- the one that blew me on the edge of the ice .
i knew that there were more open water bodies , and i had a college company .
i had known that , but i &apos;d expected something .
this was the view of my tent , when i got this kind of book call .
and just out of the air i saw the big picture .
and they were doing it , and they wanted to go back to the coast , and every five died on the back .
and that said that a jewish man , so it &apos;s a lot of it .
but some days later , we thought about our students , and we said , &quot; what would happen if this six-year-old guy wouldn &apos;t have been in this condition ?
one day in 1964 , the three of the most remote three miles of the pacific , saw 20 american shark &apos;s license , and they go to the sea in the ocean .
but at a certain point , most of them learn to give up visions , and they &apos;re getting infected .
they have the same structure .
some of us tend to be able to read their fears more than others .
right , fear is a startling gift of imagination , a kind of a kind of a design of life in the life , a way to look at the future , if time is , to influence your appearance .
nothing happened . no violence . nothing .
we brought them into every living room in the arab world -- international , global , through our english channel .
they were separated from their people , from the masses , and now we &apos;re going to break them up , one after the other .
thank you very much .
because we discovered that it &apos;s taking care of people , and people want to be informed -- they &apos;re hearing the most important thing about our internet .
and frankie said , &quot; i &apos;m as a 22 year-old row , and i see the needle on me , and there &apos;s blood .
you want to share a needle just as little as you want to share a toothbrush , even with someone you &apos;re going to be with .
so this is a very different point of all of the most powerful animals in the united states , and this is the studies that show that the most effective ones are effective , quite many of them .
so you can see these awful pictures of africa .
i &apos;m now saying , oh yeah , great .
ines is a little bit of a sudden on the streets . it &apos;s a girl with tail .
she was 105 years old when i made this photograph of her .
hey , hey , black-eyed susie , hey .
and a little banjo . here &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
we were with the car in the middle of the street , texas , where i spent my early childhood .
and mother was just sitting in the car .
let &apos;s try it with this old song . i sing : there &apos;s a long white robe in the sky , i know .
originally from the brothers of the brothers , the later the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; world &apos;s &quot; built , &quot; which is where the sound comes .
well , that &apos;s easier to say than done .
we were not stupid : we put a piece of representation on the road , a piece of representation .
when the new world was new , the thought came to me , why can &apos;t you take the oldest to the &quot; the tele-actor &quot; rhythms , and combine it with the latest technology ?
now , i think it works because scientists are connected to a community .
it &apos;s significant to show the place in the room , because it &apos;s critical , not in terms of where other things are , but in terms of the absolute idea of the space that was for newton god .
and in a relational universe , the only possible explanation was that it was kind of making itself .
and you understand some things better than others , and therefore there &apos;s a more powerful thing , and there &apos;s a lot of the politics .
there &apos;s another tedster who talked about two years ago , jonathan haidt , who defined his work in three different levels .
and just to leave everything there .
as five months of it , he &apos;s going to experiment with a full set of things .
that was not very successful . and so on and so on .
or philip glass or maine , or the chemical brothers , who played all of them there , they all had their own casa da musica logo .
after two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .
a little bit of a little bit more .
and it &apos;s a transition that has exactly the same as to do with the identity of living , like the memory of the dead .
but the most important thing about the wealth of wealth is also showing the status of the deceased , and so much the family &apos;s family .
if we could expand our definition of death to promote life , we could experience death as part of our lives and maybe the death with something else than fear .
i wanted to end my show with a dance ...
you talk about the water in the water , and the connection , the context between darwinism and the fact that we &apos;re all naked , less , less , and we can swim good .
ok , gordon , come on .
&quot; and now she has a beginner . &quot;
eight years of american history , eight minutes of my show , are just so over .
and jack beats says , &quot; i want to be a better person . &quot;
&quot; make this world a better place if you can .
so i &apos;ll give you the message to the question : trying not to go extinct .
where are the little ? &quot;
and here &apos;s the people coming back .
you can imagine , it &apos;s one thing , a more , a design of the brain , but if you go into a museum and says , &quot; it doesn &apos;t bother you if i put your hands , right ? &quot;
and you could have my mind , you know , there &apos;s a clue .
so we &apos;re a lot of time , and we &apos;ve collected a lot and we &apos;ve found a lot of animals .
so we know that torosaurus is actually a certified triceratops .
it looks like it could even be bigger .
we wanted to make an atmospheric architecture .
all the water of the world is being served here , so we thought that after you &apos;re on the water , it &apos;s going to breathe through water , and you can breathe water , you could drink the building .
the drill was put on a fire ride .
then you come up in this glass elevator , and you go up with the water .
before and after .
this is a guy from salt lake city . this is what the hell looks like .
&quot; drawn &quot; -- as if they were seduced to commit a nuclear war .
it &apos;s not sure that this would be so resolved if the editor weren &apos;t a woman .
by the way , wired was taken to hearts .
analyze the news , you talk about , if something is missing , like the people in the new york times .
this particular plant is combining the calcium and other interconnected chemicals from the air .
m the most time i need to take a look at the morning , when i try to figure out what &apos;s going to happen .
and then , remember , when you had a little bit of rice at a given event , and was he criticized for this ?
pm : are you hit by resistance as you &apos;ve done this to the rationale of foreign foreign ?
when i was secretary of state , only 13 women were secretary of foreign wars .
thank you for having us today .
malaria : there are eight countries in sub-saharan africa that could reduce death rates to 75 percent .
for the mining of us , it &apos;s a very basic zone , and it &apos;s fair to say that i &apos;m sexually aroused by this kind of thing .
to be exactly , today , in their capital , some of them , in those heavy times , the treasury cut and the life-saving programs like the global fund .
in the opposite , it could save a lot of life .
if we take this metaphor of a genome as a program , now , you have to think that chris anderson is a little bit of a sudden , as jim anderson , and all of us .
you design something like a mobile phone , and in very abstract language , you &apos;re following this cell phone .
this is normal dna , which is what it is for normal dna .
we heat them , add something salt , they &apos;re almost heating to the bottom , and they &apos;re going to cool them down , and while the blink of the pin sticks , the short strands that make long and it forms a structure .
so that works really well , and you can build patterns and form , ok ?
you zoom in , there &apos;s only four strands of dna , and you sit on a single side of them , which can be put on other tiles if you can fit .
we have a very , very popular computer program where little changes -- tiny , single mutations -- something that created a square of a size , and make something much bigger .
and they used to use the calculations , and to understand it and get it better in the handle , how feynman said , we need to build something to understand it .
but as we saw it , we had three main projects : a world class life support , which has completely separate food , and universal accessible to everyone with an medical medical system , regardless of its financial resources .
in modern time , where a big deal , and the fight about survival is the ordinary person &apos;s usual , and the bribe is just going to get to the bribe .
in my last 18 months as a lawyer , fighting against small and large , the case of india &apos;s biggest business , including the case of india &apos;s biggest business .
sm : well , the most important cost was less than 200 rupees .
this is the global footprint of all the life talks that come from the world , from new york to the small new zealand here in the corner .
in a lot of content , we usually do a few things to make it easier .
so we use these online tools to find unique talks , which are many different fields in ways that are different to their own topic , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re really creative between the field of bridges .
no wonder that it comes up my colleagues , because the truth is hard to digest .
the work of the design system could be as good in a hospital as well as a hospital .
ted is terrifying ubiquitous .
how do these things happen ?
second , the second for you , nature &apos;s known nature , of modern american school , is , step , step for one , one of the things .
and said , &quot; would you have a nuclear waste waste in your community ? &quot;
it &apos;s not to get to do this . teach more ethics courses .
why ? because they &apos;re happy to do something that is right .
bill gates talked about the importance of education and in particular about the model of kipp . &quot; knowledge is power . &quot;
barry schwartz makes a passionate call for &quot; practical wisdom &quot; as an antidote to a society that has lost in the most profitable . he argued that rules often fail , incentives and practical wisdom , helps our world to reinvent our world .
by the way , dean , the arm has to fit a 50 percent of a football company , so the wooden line of the little finger , and he has to weigh less than four pounds .
it takes another nine to make it functional and useful . &quot;
he &apos;s doing this , darpa &apos;s asked .
boys and girls have been given enough .
it was amazing how positive they were all .
he wants to help . he told me that he wants to go back to help his buddies .
how do we come out ?
you can look at war like a tragedy or a farce .
ford moved . they were a leg , and then the other one .
in london , i lived for 44 days in a college school with nothing as water .
and i have a little bit of time . in my first attempt , i don &apos;t even have a minute for me to hold it back for a minute .
there are a lot of time where people are going to come deep as deep as possible .
it &apos;s a big and weighs to the big and weighs .
because of the movement , i wasted oxygen .
then his favorite day , he broke his record .
and there was no way to slow my heart rate .
after 14 minutes , i had these terrible escalators like this need to breathe .
as a magician , i try to show people things that seem impossible .
so congratulations . they &apos;ve finished the institution now .
tamara , you take this one ?
even now , the human may change the most compelling thing through the waste of its civilization .
in africa , people have been consumed by 600 million wildlife farmers and two billion pounds of bush meat .
first , even if all the co2 emissions were stopped today , the global warming would continue to be kept .
and then we saw a case of the east coast of the united states , and it moved to every year with every year .
today , there &apos;s another movement . the movement that is going to save earth .
the fifth of the fifth , the fifth , whose picture is , died .
i want to give you a kind of a kind of a demonstration of a kind of a design that &apos;s going to end up with what this change means : i want to explain to you what &apos;s going on for us and our biodiversity , but also how
and if it was just about that , that would be really interesting .
in this salmon , it &apos;s a genetically genetically common salmon , which is a gene that has created from the intersection of a gene that &apos;s made of a gene that &apos;s made of this a loaf of a loaf of a loaf .
these are actually intersections and not real animals .
we took this animal to the other . &quot;
in other words , this was the first creature in the history of this world , which had a computer as an parent -- it didn &apos;t have organic parents .
paul collier : it &apos;s time to question ,
if darwin had only the nasa .
bernard , in his different forms , existed probably on earth since billions of years , and it always gathered back from evolution , like this often happened .
and only in the last 5,000 years with rising frequency and distance , it &apos;s going to go .
evolution helps us .
say it further .
so old and it also may be a while , so it &apos;s very complicated , and very simple -- and that &apos;s the same time .
then they measure ... and measure ... and measure ...
i kind of got a kind of film to put a geometry of things that actually didn &apos;t have geometry .
and she took a look at the time of the period of the door to 25 , a remarkable era , which was the mathematics short of the world , and that &apos;s what the mathematics was going to be .
slow measurements , big heated movements , ? bioenergy .
and that little went out of the line of what &apos;s going on .
and that was one of my favorite projects that these islands were the same as the most important thing -- anyway , more or less .
should you remove the chest ? should you get them ?
right ? it has to be alive , so is the lego , is very good for it .
anybody ? it &apos;s a lot harder .
this can happen in an medical environment .
and why not ?
a few months later , she goes back to the market when prices are the highest , in the so-called so-called the so-called -- when food is just a little bit -- because they have to feed their family and not have a choice .
that leads to very high amounts of energy .
almost three years ago , i decided to leave my comfortable job as a senior economist in washington , and in my favorite , ethiopia , to return to almost 30 years in foreign school .
we build a system that &apos;s going to use all the most fundamental things that the integrity , trust , trust and transparency , and the small farmers are helping to deal with the risks that i &apos;ve described .
we think that this initiative requires great political will , and we need to adapt the financial sector , likewise , the underlying , and even the underlying legal framework .
my answer to this is a wall of the wall of bacteria , which is flowing through the desert .
it &apos;s a serious deal of the livelihood of millions of people , especially in africa and china .
a problem with the plants of trees is that people are so poor in this region that they are the trees to get trees to use them as a wood .
and , after the fda , 60 dollars of the bacteria that you have never had to pay for , would be a cubic meter of a meter of income .
in a time of unprecedented population and increasingly , it could be a sense of time .
the world shows me opportunities , and i picked out .
our goal is a treasure design , so that we have a very , very , very , very , single single dvd dvd , basically a single single single dvd dvd .
all these eggs , the bacteria , bacteria , viruses can all travel in one gram of human altruism .
it &apos;s a wonderful instrument to the alhambra .
maybe you think it &apos;s just good for a lot of people , if these men won shit , but it &apos;s also economically effective because they save a billion dollars every year .
and with shock , they found that the family had no toilet .
and at the pace of the pace , we will be able to supply people with sanitation , not reaching .
this reefs in discovery bay , jamaica , were 20 years old , the most coral reefs in the world .
he ate the slaves on the top of the world , and the song &quot; jamaica &quot; -- &quot; the &quot; jamaica rice salt &quot; -- is nice , &quot; -- is a symbol of the meaning of the design of the mountain canada in the middle canada .
and we &apos;ve done this in the last 100 to 150 years .
i &apos;ve talked about millions of times about it , but it &apos;s incredible .
the other species of climate change is the most important of the coral , it &apos;s a beautiful picture , right ?
that &apos;s not sold .
and yet we &apos;re all the best knowledge of our best knowledge .
what i saw ? stars , satellites , planes -- typical of the most typical .
and what would be behind these online systems when it was ?
and i was not being touched by all of the things i had read , because i didn &apos;t read the novel &quot; dune . &quot;
and it was so successful that it was even more sophisticated .
and the other thing is , a living little city , and to come to the beach , she said , you have to have a bus and then a boat .
one of them was called joseph and he asked me what i did , and i explained .
and so we &apos;re in the case .
companies are making goods for households -- we &apos;re -- and we have income , and we &apos;re growing income , and that &apos;s better to spend these income for more goods and performance .
the most important , the computer , was under zero middle 2008 , shortly before the crisis .
you can hear the lesson of the five-year-old .
and at the same time , the solution is clear because this is not necessary to change human nature .
we need to actually invest in the notion of a meaningful prosperity that makes the possibilities that people are developing .
first , it &apos;s supposed to be economists never want to be out of the sound , so it could be that they have to be a little bit more adept in their sound .
i painted it directly on the man .
it was about space and light .
this photograph was taken when i went to the bay bay bay in alaska to buy the minerals management service in the test of their own procedure , running into ice , to see .
another aspect is that it &apos;s spreading when it hits water .
and that &apos;s actually really a really profound thing .
and then of course , john d. rockefeller was .
it was also reason for the national geographic act , which is the clean air act , the clean water .
they have 20 degrees in the economy in the economy , in economics . they &apos;re entrepreneurs . they don &apos;t want to do what they do .
if you look at people who earn 50,000 dollars in the years , the two children who have three jobs , maybe three jobs , and then they have to mobilize .
we have to do things like this , and you can find more about this politics .
the first person is familiar with you .
here she is telling in a rock star star , as her friends were telling them , because not to participate , and they said they leave their friends to leave the democracy .
last year , when i was here , i talked about my swim at the north pole .
it feels like someone behind you are standing and you beat you with a hammer all the time .
and we sat down , and we were going to go back and we were going to see what was wrong there on mt . everest .
so , the math system about it , is talking about it , and give a hundred percent . because there &apos;s only very , very few things that can &apos;t get achieved if we use our whole power for it .
this is a very simple thing . it &apos;s a very simple computer .
can we get a kind of carbon type ?
now what i &apos;m going to show you here is that we can create a design map -- the b -- the b -- a string of components that follow extremely simple rules .
these are three minutes of light .
and if you saw amy smith , she talks about how to get students on the mit with communities in haiti .
and it may be that all of us seem to be overwhelming of the sensations today , and so that , as well as the number of problems we need to solve .
we &apos;re increasingly aware that we have to get rid of the whole business of information .
okay . i also have one .
can we connect to the natural ecosystems around us by adding rivers back to the example of these things , and these things ?
how you can see the death rate of 65,000 dead per conflict , per year in the 1950s to 2,000 dead per conflict per year in these decade , so that &apos;s so bad .
because we did something right , and it would be good to figure out what it is .
they want to do the most important .
if not , one of the two will be updated , right ?
the developing world used soap and water , relief .
and now i have the most salient thing on this axis .
and you remember the beginning of the last century , that was very bad . until that so-called big leap , it &apos;s going to be a big leap .
do you see how they grow ? and how hundreds of millions of millions of people are getting out of poverty ?
here we are . we have a continuity in the world .
look . this is the world .
they get clean water . they buy food for the poor . they &apos;re malaria .
and we need to look at the way we look at the world with facts .
don &apos;t make it quite africa . don &apos;t make a problem of it .
it &apos;s not sustainable . and it &apos;s not going to happen to be a twist .
and many of you have heard the term &quot; memes &quot; -- evolution of technology is something that i &apos;m giving a lot of attention to , so , you know , one of the first things that you had was a little bit of a little bit of a
my argument is basically that , well , the time , you know , we &apos;ve always been part of our lives .
and this is quite new , and i think it &apos;s much worse -- this possibility -- because of developments in information technology , in the ocean technology , in the ocean , as a weapon , as a weapon of biotechnology can be used or nanotechnology .
i do my best , okay .
&quot; the &quot; s is our &quot; means &quot; he &apos;s saved the people , &quot; what &apos;s a pretty sophisticated experience of time .
we have only in six countries , which means the media report only about six countries .
so , how do we put our money stuck ?
none of these countries , including africa &apos;s nation , has ever passed its rise .
as this process we were , africans , the african , the edge of the development , and the policy of politics in our countries .
the consumer is mostly the most inclusive , it costs billions of billions .
we &apos;d like to interview them . &quot; and i said , &quot; great . &quot;
and now 14 of the diseases are treatable , two of them even .
so in the last 10 years , and as a hope for the future , we &apos;ve seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology : a science of what makes life worthwhile .
and i think there are three different -- and i call them different because they &apos;re in different interventions , it &apos;s possible to have a rather than one of the other -- three different happy lives .
but it turns out that there was no sexual trauma .
you can &apos;t look like a little bit of the piano .
and what you &apos;re finding is that if you do something fun , the most fun thing is .
when i was 30 years ago , i thought , if i was good enough to make someone not depressed , not afraid , not mad , i would make him happy .
a polar bear , floating in the arctic , took from paul kamen &apos;s .
but this so-called &quot; snapshot &quot; comes up when all parts of the parts are put together , not just the event , but also my emotional connection to this .
nick -- again with automatic camera -- has taken thousands of photos of this .
sometimes you can tell a large story on focused ways .
we want to find solutions too .
and then somehow all of us go and jump .
thank you .
more importantly , this is a kind of a design process that you can see in only three seconds : we can be emily in a period of less than one afternoon in a few different ways , and the other afternoon .
emily : image metrics is a highly noisy , scalable computer program .
i was going to be involved in it .
in the reserve , there &apos;s a few nice primates .
but i was out of the west and i worked in the east .
all over the time , they were broken , they killed animals , the forest , and so on .
here is a coltan , coltan , and gold .
one day we met with the computer bank .
the elephant just took a way and they took the most sophisticated .
i don &apos;t think anybody can blame google , because google does the right thing , even if people like al qaeda use google to connect .
corneille ewango : a hero of the world &apos;s war
we have , almost without having it noticed , from a market market to a market market .
they don &apos;t have to pay it from their budget .
i should be practicing them , what happened with these experiments .
democracy doesn &apos;t need a perfect equality , but it needs citizens to share a common life .
so the u.s. as a nation in 1900 , where the line is shifting to red .
we have gotten this gift in the &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s , when women have been in the prison market .
electricity was helpful to the women in the liberation .
one amazing fact for the most amazing is that in the first half of the 20th century , the life expectancy is three times as fast as the second half of the 19th century .
this was the paper i wrote in 11 years , and i got a two + two .
i have some that thought that there was a lot of time , between five and 15 , and that led to a feeling of failure .
so if i look at creativity , i think there &apos;s also this point or the inability to suppress the connections that i see between virtually everything in life .
that &apos;s what buddhist fishermen say because they don &apos;t actually kill creatures .
and they &apos;re going to notice more often .
and i had to find what to fit the story .
how are we going to do what the responsibility and the causes are , outside of a dish ?
and you have to be in all the ways that i &apos;ve never seen before .
i hope you &apos;ll see me when i &apos;m going to get these examples , because i &apos;m actually talking about everything you might spend your time .
now there are magazines about water .
people pay the full price for both , and the only thing they have together is that they don &apos;t have anything in common .
the corners of the road , on the middle , the very big market .
these guys are putting the most sophisticated video of the world .
but you don &apos;t have to be more inclusive -- you don &apos;t have to be completely dismissed .
so what you have to do is figure out who &apos;s interested in it .
nine months later , i went to date , and i was a painting in tahrir square , and i was a picture that i saw in my inbox .
thank you .
most of the time that the cultural legacy is in us to look back and to go back to the past .
my first documentary for national geographic , where i realized you can bring environmental problems in a documentary of nature , i was dedicated to the world &apos;s history .
these are the lions and tigers of the sea .
and because i love sharks -- i was obsessed with them -- i wanted to do a different , more positive story about sharks to talk about the need of protection for sharks .
after i left , i learned that this habitat is going to be a new way to create a new design model .
they also caught up in the street .
but when the fish came back and returned to sea pricing and the population controlled , forests grew in the flat water , the sea of seaweed .
now , she lives in the jungle of the internet , and this is a little bit of a sudden , you &apos;re the second son , by the way , the son of the second orangutans i saved , and i &apos;m saved .
it was a biological desert .
and then you see the returns and starts measuring what comes out .
so how do we break this cycle ?
and you need bacteria to bind the nitrogen , and without that microorganisms will not give you any performance .
humidity is 10 percent higher .
so we can really change the climate .
in the process of engineering , it &apos;s the driven , there &apos;s a democratic culture , so you can use the law to protect your own system .
the most salient kennedy , which is a paddle on a roadside &apos;s fire .
i &apos;ll show you one more .
reuben is making kinetic sculptures , beautiful works , beautiful works that are moving into the pattern , or moving into the waves of the brain , and in nine minutes , he &apos;s inspired us with his favorite art -- at the same time , of mathematics and nature
every city has their own design .
23 years later , we asked us to come and develop this idea .
this is the italian portal , the ukrainian park , the most sobering park , the japanese park , the german park .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
either it doesn &apos;t exist or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or anything , but no case of science .
people always say that consciousness is hard to define .
you can &apos;t think of your own existence of your own consciousness .
it &apos;s a digital computer program in the brain , and to create consciousness , we have to find the right program .
we &apos;re constantly bringing the objectivity and the subjectivity as a properties of reality and as a properties of expertise .
do you find ?
but i also meet people who do what they do , they love , and they couldn &apos;t imagine doing something else .
we don &apos;t teach american history in britain .
teenagers don &apos;t have a column .
maybe later , not immediately .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
i couldn &apos;t just make this thing work , no matter how much or how much i was going to do .
but we have to move from a industrial model to a design model where every single school can flourish .
erez and i wanted to figure out more about it .
the reason that this is being digitized is being digitized in a very small pace .
there &apos;s a light on it . she said , &quot; okay , so it &apos;s serious .
she led a group of students to protest in the streets of a protest .
i stood up , made an tea , sat down and everything and now i &apos;m here -- still almost paralyzed , but here .
so , peace direct constructs gives you the back .
he wrote a book called &quot; from the dictatorship to democracy , &quot; with data data on the ground .
it &apos;s not like this a little bit of a sudden .
in fact , chris worried about and said , &quot; look , show you this photograph , you &apos;ll think that you &apos;re still one of these crazy modern artists that don &apos;t do much . &quot;
it &apos;s an object for the mind .
and the solution that i &apos;m doing is the largest of the world &apos;s greatest world &apos;s greatest amount of time in the world through humanity and the from that of the biosphere .
so i said , &quot; what would t be the counter -- we call him a little bit of a crack , where they &apos;re going to affect the impact , in the denominator -- call it to where they &apos;re going to make the impact ? &quot;
and he was a huge school system on the market that has increased our revenues and profits .
we &apos;ve literally won the most amazing .
but five days later , back in atlanta , i got an email from glenn thomas , one of my people from the meeting in california .
so , frankly , i &apos;m afraid of a lot of us who work in the industry that the industry is threatened by technology and possibly more likely to be able to get into technology .
and truly , we need somebody to give us a sense of the naked , so we have a experience with a very naked one ?
the arts , whatever they do , store us every time they &apos;re tagging us , to look at our way to the world with a little bit of our curiosity and curiosity .
the three sisters , the three sisters , had a little bit of the great music of life with her passionate music , and at tedwomen begins with the happy and more thoughtful , and then you &apos;re playing a little , autocratic version of astor &apos;s name . then
the manchester elected driven driven by my quarter is named .
he makes a bunch of money through the practice of special furniture for rich people .
we took the curriculum in the way the american prize curriculum , which is the harvard harvard system , and we &apos;re a little bit of a health company for mothers in the middle of the city in the middle of downtown downtown .
we &apos;ve noticed that you have to give them flowers and the sunlight and the food and the expectations and herbie &apos;s music and so you can cure the spiritual cancer forever .
these kids who were given all the world to fly from public schools , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re capable of , with affection and sunlight and good music and confidence .
and it has worked all right .
and i &apos;m going to allow you to take the concert , and i &apos;ll give you the music , and you should ever decide to sell them to sell a agreement that &apos;s going to be used to support the money of school . &quot;
this is a space of nancy wilson built that her album in our school last christmas took .
the brown building , which is you looked at you and i tell you where i made my greatest mistake .
he came to me . he said , &quot; man , that &apos;s a fabulous story .
and so he has a group of people .
bill strickland tells a calm and amazing story of redemption through art , music and unusual alliance .
and the transducer then brings the most sophisticated thing to the code to get into the brain , and the result is a very common , which produces a normal body .
but there was the key factor , the problem with the code , and how to make cells better answers to the normal reactions , and so that was our contribution .
they cover us with an invisible diagnostic system that &apos;s made of attacks from the environment , so that we &apos;re staying healthy .
but if the bacteria grow and they double and they &apos;re all involved in making these molecules , then the number of molecules are proportional to the cell , the number of molecules outside the cell .
now we know that all bacteria can speak together .
this is just a photo -- a single one of your skin .
bacteria have become incredibly adept , which is that we kill bacteria .
the fact is that bacteria have a collective behavior and they &apos;re going to meet tasks that they can never do , if they &apos;re just acting as individuals .
it &apos;s a great honor to come to this conference .
or the first , that come in the hall .
but , if we think about justice , aristotle says what we need to think about , is the actual character of the brain activity and qualities that are worth it , they &apos;re missing them , they &apos;re ignorant and realizing .
what a reason for a reason ?
charlie , what do you say to warren ?
here it is , as he &apos;s doing it .
so aristotle has an identity of flutes , and the cat &apos;s name , and the elastic question of marriage marriage is right .
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic debate
many people said , &quot; well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , get rural guys , you know , we &apos;re not going to have a rural guy who &apos;s going to start with us with our
and i think that &apos;s good -- the future humanity can make a decision .
so , if that &apos;s what &apos;s called what is this ?
i &apos;m going to argue that the speed of the world &apos;s velocity will go .
i &apos;m going to argue that nonsense .
we know that there are this threshold because we don &apos;t get any of these feathers before we reach a food age , and that &apos;s even the damage of our birth of our birth .
that means you have to do your homework to understand if this is true .
audience : hello . i &apos;ve read somewhere in the last 20 years , the average life expectancy of virtually every one on the planet around 10 years .
not one of their media has done this .
we don &apos;t care how to make our profit .
they were in the center of the street and they sat on the agenda .
but i can &apos;t present a moment of present to the most popular , the most important ones that i have , of economists , epidemiologists and environmental situations .
the most scary thing is , and probably you know a part of the most likely time .
fourteen americans die per day per day , which is three times like in the &apos; 90s , and almost everything comes from the street .
he obviously had sense of humor .
politicians and the security designers have been afraid to market the &quot; &quot; aw &quot; as &quot; the &quot;
second , because we &apos;ve eradicated them .
so we thought , &quot; let &apos;s try . &quot;
there &apos;s some amazing animals .
immediately , the government said , &quot; enough -- we &apos;ll go to it . &quot; and paying people to pay every one of them , who they saw .
he might think he would have ever been born the baby , so he might need a little help from outside .
i asked peter if something changed . and he said , &quot; no , &quot; no .
we want to deal with africa , the next chapter , and this is : a healthy , more beautiful , beautiful african .
but most of all , you have to be productive in your life , and create a kind of productive environment in our countries , so that things can be done .
we can connect all this together ?
we were on the side of the street .
i had to crawl through the legs of these people , and i had to go to my back to find a window .
you know , we need to use everything .
and often i don &apos;t see african employees among them .
now , the question is , how can we use that from all this good will that comes to us ?
you &apos;re a dance maker . &quot;
we have a lot of internet science in nigeria with the most sophisticated .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is effective , i took this argument to look at them , so we can study them , exactly how we can study any other complex process .
the method was used since the &apos; 90s to study extremely complex processes .
i want to try and show this for you briefly .
and then i &apos;m in the room room , here , games in change .
now , how do you study rap scientifically ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity that &apos;s involved in the ground in the field of affairs .
i want to say , probabilities and statistics , that &apos;s the mathematics of games and the design of the games .
this is very time-consuming , and it &apos;s not pleasant .
but keep the idea of the whole time of eight seconds .
in play and virtual worlds , for example , their facial expressions can be used , of course , and intuitively being used to control a avatar or a virtual character .
otherwise they actually spoil very quickly , and without a stable grid , it &apos;s not possible , so children die .
another statement of esther was that we react to a tragedy like haiti , but this is a key thing .
it &apos;s produced by the malaria plant , and it &apos;s a very interesting kind of practical substance .
we have every street , every village , almost every square of madagascar .
in your inbox , a very cheap blue laser is a very cheap laser .
audience : yeah !
and what &apos;s interesting is , although we &apos;ve got the whole time , we &apos;ve never managed to put the file in the air .
this is the restaurant of acorn .
this is the kind of the one that you see here , actually , growing in a square of a field , which was made by the outside and the air system .
so , water is a more important aspect .
&quot; metal &quot; and &quot; earth &quot; are still out .
the idea is not more sophisticated .
you don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
once it touches the water , you should hear how air comes out .
once we sequenced these two genomes , we asked ourselves , if this is the smallest genome of a themselves , could it even be a smaller genome of it ?
moreover , we realized that once that worked , it would have a real opportunity , and then if we could bring the synthetic chromosomes to the bacteria , it &apos;s the bacteria .
so care is a lot of time .
the last one is a quote from robert feynman : &quot; what i can &apos;t build myself , i can &apos;t understand . &quot;
but actually , we &apos;re in the northwest here in the northwest very close to the actual idea of paradise , the 36 times , which is defined as &quot; gardens , &quot; which is defined by radiation streams .
but the more you add , the more you have to go .
and this number 72 comes never coming before .
this is a nest of a tires , and this is the nest entrance .
this is a colony that has been founded by a queen in the previous summer .
the most important thing -- that &apos;s a magnifying set of a magnifying group -- you &apos;re an interesting group . you go outside the morning before the first group is distributed .
strangely and interestingly , it looks like that , as if about half the ant colony doesn &apos;t do .
the nest maintenance workers just take all the people and bring them to the edge of the roof of the world and put it there .
but the foragers are somehow deciding not getting out .
and we &apos;ve done experiments that show that the longer one ant is turned out , the more the simple hydrocarbons on their surface changes . so the ants make different work to do different things .
they &apos;re going to cover the entire earth , except antarctica .
here you see , the cost of all of the world in about 89 million barrels are about 89 million barrels of oil , and the annual cost is three trillion dollars .
and we do that for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
that &apos;s not to do anything .
i &apos;ve thought of how we can use natural gas .
and when i was in the process of natural gas , natural gas was nine dollars .
why don &apos;t you worry about that ?
so just 500 million were wiped out .
it was never a heat of water , or something like that .
tbp : i lost 150 million in the wind , ok ?
some have 5,000 . a lot of them have more .
there was a lot of time . and there was a lot of time .
the life is a event . let &apos;s get it out of the world .
these are work in lower manhattan where you built the first ted structure .
these were in maybe six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to be the light bulb .
a friend of mine told me this story : the story came not only and had to wait , but then the most powerful , but then the most important , when they were there , they had to call somebody .
so sometimes i &apos;m going to use a more clinical language , and maybe it &apos;s not going to be so warm to you as well as other conversations about compassion .
and here &apos;s the basic idea that the most good thing to do is to make people who are going to be engaged in it .
it &apos;s basically when you &apos;re my enemy or my other the other , if you &apos;re not my friend or to my family , i &apos;m much less on it , and i &apos;m going to do a lot less to use the golden rule on you . okay
so , the results , the results are coming up . this is a zero-sum game .
each shape of interdependence , personalized , forces one that recognizes humanity &apos;s humanity .
and then you &apos;ll explain to you , the other thinking that america doesn &apos;t get respect and even dominate them , and they hate america .
most of the diseases related to poverty , but in the case of cancer , the children who died in cancer , mostly come from wealthy families .
a week died a child died , but nothing changed .
because you just don &apos;t use this kind of energy and time , if it doesn &apos;t really care .
so he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
now the dominant thing is , there &apos;s a single oncogene in a single cancer cell , and that this is a single oncogene .
what does that mean ?
we found a kind of a design structure that has the right extracellular matrix , we put the cells in and lo and behold , in about four days , they were going to see the world &apos;s book and the right , what we &apos;ve produced in a culture
and of course , we &apos;re asking ourselves where we &apos;re going now ?
and so i want to end with a poem .
we have a little journalist , who was caught in the most vivid , a young student , whose book has so many of the most sophisticated quotes , that you &apos;ve taken it from the shelves ; a polish about fake , a starry , consistent in the new
it sounds like a little bit like a weird book , but it &apos;s actually about new kinds of lies .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise !
you &apos;ve got four good friends to rediscover their personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can look at my mind ; i used to be talking to you earlier .
they were telling , how big the bath was , or said , the most powerful , and so far from hotel .
this is where the woman 2 : right there , glass , make a photo !
and you want to be able to get your eyes out of it .
but it really has opened my eyes , as many as i &apos;ve been interrupted from life for emails , social networks and so on , even though it really has nothing really important or more important .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band from a plastic of mine .
and everybody who was going to go back to the end , i went to it .
at least for me , because if i always do the same thing , i &apos;m very , very boring . i &apos;m very quick .
i see myself as ... i don &apos;t know what i see .
are you going to be nervous , you ?
im : do you worry ? you &apos;re looking so cute .
anyway , i don &apos;t say it &apos;s good , but only that it &apos;s not too much , ok ?
if you have the bomb too long , it &apos;s going to be buttermilk .
i call it the era of the citizenship -- what people different race or ethnic disorders can be , but as citizens , all the same way to be equal .
in egypt , i eventually discovered , of course , ever discovered .
this had been studied in london , was trained in yemen , and it was a plane to attack america to attack america .
there &apos;s no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols that are using the democratic culture on the ground .
as an anecdote , we can show that if poverty is the only factor , now , a family &apos;s family is one of the richest families saudi .
what happened there was a political coalition that was going to be a political goal , and that was to remove the leaders .
these tools are only becoming social when they &apos;re physically boring .
it &apos;s essentially turning the limits of the single networks and then it &apos;s a lot of time .
and because of the social networking , chinese students who studied abroad , or companies from the rest of the world , had the offices in china , there were people all over the world who heard these messages .
and finally , the chinese had been drawn through .
we &apos;re always more in a media landscape in media globally , socially , ubiquitous and cheap .
but in terms of thinking , i &apos;m still going to be doing this as i was talking to it .
in my fourth side side , a comet moved to everest , a comet .
this view is the top up , the first 600 meters of the climb base base .
and this is in camp 4 .
and there were climbers on this summit ridge .
we also got the bad news that beck musk , another climbers , collapsed in this storm , collapsed and died .
it &apos;s so appealing to work up , that i sometimes had even even syringes right through the clothing .
this climber was a huge thing .
and i can just alert how it did that .
and so he &apos;s going to be thinking back in the actions .
these are sherpas , the most delicious .
and the fourth thing that &apos;s very important for me is , &quot; ideas that we need to share . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , through the entrepreneurial rise , entrepreneurs became models of models , and they &apos;re in a big way to society .
it was a lot of people who wanted to bring democracy to democracy because they bring the ideas to the universal right , parliament and the constitution and so on .
the third thing is again .
the second is the most important thing that we have , which is a entrepreneurs that makes entrepreneurs so difficult to create social jobs in companies that 93 percent of the indian jobs are in the middle of the world .
so , if you &apos;re a young country , you have the chance to introduce a modern modern technology model , so you don &apos;t have the most likely to get older when you get older .
you have to have a clear strategy of what &apos;s important for india and important for the world .

and finally , with this one , i can get my sound out of my right , i &apos;m making sure , let &apos;s repeat .
our people had to try about 5,000 different types of dna to find the right .
don &apos;t listen to those who say , you can &apos;t do it . everybody can do that .
on the right is a very , very clear thing .
and i &apos;m going to give you a few examples .
you see the blue transducer .
his wife said it was &quot; the happiest day in her life . &quot;
many of these patients are going to pull the water out .
the results are better than the surgical .

street street , i know .
and that &apos;s where you really do a lot of your creative inspiration , so it &apos;s a industry that runs into both directions .
and that &apos;s why you want to go to the next trend and that &apos;s how fast you can do it .
and their jokes , like the most cosmopolitan of a football company , works really only within this aesthetic .

now , the rate is 70 percent , if you get it , but that &apos;s hard .
it will be murdered so many people that the only thing that &apos;s going to be in not a poor funeral is like this one outside of the street of the cockpit .
but the other thing i hear is , i &apos;m going to hear people talk about fear , a certain aversion of the risk .

patient capital is uncomfortable for people who look for simple solutions , easy categories , because we don &apos;t see the way that we &apos;re going to win the kind of instrument .
but the entire community , all different influences , also the most important and more cosmopolitan , would sit down and pray . &quot;
because when you &apos;re full of the juice , it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s green , you feed the world , you &apos;re going to get it into the sky . &quot;
but no faces ?
ok , now let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
i tried to make a little joy of joy .
why do i not make any of my wife , locally produced a sanitary pad ?
but here &apos;s the problem . because a company is doing a cotton pad and it works .
soc : i see this thing in my wife &apos;s hands , &quot; why do you use a horrible rag towel ? &quot;
now , you can get 110 countries on it . okay ?
and it was so beautiful that i was always there in the last seven years .
then i ran a huge amount of training . i swam in freezing and made it .
it was actually happening that the cells in my fingers were going to be able to get into it and get it out of it .
and my good friend david saw how i thought . and he came up and said , &quot; lewis , i know you since you &apos;re 18 years old .
the prospect that they could be extinct in 30 years , 40 years of extinction .
england , america , japan , south africa , congo .
it &apos;s about 380 trillion gallons of oil on earth today , which can be absorbed and manipulated .

so , very special material that the abalone shell itself , millions of abalone shell , all the time , every year .
and the idea behind it was basically that i &apos;m the paintbrush in the great personalities that come and interview and interview .
but i wanted to draw interviews that are different .

half of the body was lost , the other one .
this is a wiki in kathmandu , nepal .
i don &apos;t want to do beautiful things .
there &apos;s a certain kind of treatment , which is called the &quot;
it &apos;s not the painting that we were doing , but what we actually did is actually painted .
another example : again , a stupid mother .
thank you .
no , we talk about 10 million , 20 million dollars on the swiss bank site , on the federal bank in the world , from the ministers of the president , the high officers of the state .
they &apos;re even holding hold of it .

if you want to go into a restaurant , if you want to look at the menu , you &apos;ll expect it to be all on the map ?

well , he &apos;s sharing his life .
this french painter was known for his life for a little bit , but even people were also making people .
unfortunately , this immigrant now is the most of the time with a series of other orphans in the archive , and some of them are beautiful paintings .

&quot; congratulations , &quot; you get to your side wedding , james .
my father lived most of his time in east africa .
i &apos;d like to show you six minutes .
so , the other thing that we do is , our movies , they &apos;re stories , with whom our people can identify .
so it &apos;s a young man out there , and it &apos;s really what can bring to what can happen , and think about it , or any of these , or some of them behavior .
thanks to that , so much to say , so little time .
i think this is really the subject of this event .
thanks to this , you &apos;ve described this as a business of networks of the world .
it &apos;s basically a cd . it &apos;s a little bit of a time .
now art art art . oh , that was fantastic .
that was really fantastic .
video games can be very profound , even though they &apos;re completely immersed .

so time , space , aesthetics , and then most importantly , behavior .
i had to shut down a few bridges behind me .
all of it refers to the most important and students who were being diagnosed by the first meeting , that they were being denied a place .
so i made some sketches on napkins -- little boxes and the things i was usually doing .
it &apos;s one of the most beautiful pieces i &apos;ve ever done .
this beautiful object , the swiss army army , for me , becomes a surgical procedure .
and one day i had a -- oh , vice versa .
i &apos;ve got the copper and the copper very thin , so it &apos;s a lot of the copper .
and that &apos;s my cafeteria line .
and it reminded me why i was doing things like my house as well as my house .
it was never finished .
the dome was a wish to be the most prolific .
it was a trial that was a little bit of land -- it &apos;s 30 in 76 feet -- to turn into a brain , to make these areas separated and the building room and the dining room in this pavilion , with a high space in it .
they call this a &quot; plan popcorn . &quot;
here it is .
from the building in the background , it seems to be a plastic iceberg in the mountains .
our job didn &apos;t want a galleries , so -- and as we met our new dictionary , he told us that this was the right shape .
in barcelona , i was asked to make a fish , we just work on the foot of the street , which was made by the street of the world , the most cosmopolitan and the design of the world .
can we not make clean burning oxygen systems ?
and one of the things they found was they didn &apos;t break .
and this is our favorite briquettes , and this is the briquettes .
and he compared the problem of health impacts and coal in comparison .
it &apos;s a place where , for example , when india was , in this room , only three of us had a car .
so you can &apos;t use the same concepts as in the united states to move things out .
there &apos;s a big difference .
after a surgery , everything is going on .
now , this is not surprising . but we asked them to control their honesty and intelligence , kindness and plastic .
he was married . he had a son named the bell .
is this business with our outward and our employment with a quantum phenomenon ?
now i want to tell you a little bit of surgery that we &apos;re doing , how far we &apos;re and where we want .
we can replace the bone bone structure , but we &apos;re not very far about replacing facial contact .
my theme is food in schools , because here it is about social justice .
and the next is the next .
people are constantly talking about sustainability . but we should find out what it is .
you know , you all have to think , you must always eat more and more food ?
and then they have a lot of things , hey , we can sell the stuff to children .
and this is a typical secret .
things that we might do at home , and for so important , we have to teach kids to teach kids in schools .
we need to educate the employees .
this eight billion means two dollars , and 49 cents -- so much money , the government is ready for lunch .
as a little girl , my grandfather was sitting on a hot hot book .
if i go to a party and people ask me what i do , and i say , &quot; i &apos;m a professor , &quot; will you be matt , you &apos;re going to matt .
i want to do your favorite , everything about your favorite creature , and you &apos;re ignoring that you &apos;re a professional in your own consciousness .
don &apos;t make the tension . i want to be a little bit more enjoyable .
it &apos;s a documentary in a documentary of consciousness .
when i got closer , i expected to see all the details of most people , their clothes and so on .
how do you know that it was what they did ?
see it ? who &apos;s not looking at it ? that &apos;s going to help .
we start to go back to the point . some examples .
this morning , jeff hawkins described his efforts to bring a good , big theory in neuroscience .
and the most salient in london said , &quot; what do you mean with : &quot; who is in charge of london -- &quot; i mean , nobody &apos;s involved in charge . &quot;
now , congestion congestion was introduced in stockholm at january of january , and the first picture , here &apos;s a picture of stockholm , a typical street on january , a typical street .
so , we did this enormous survey with lots of plastic problems and tried to figure out who changed and where they disappeared .
then i went to 20 years old -- from eastern europe to central asia -- through the mountains of the caucasus , rich east , russia .
what do we know from the taliban &apos;s climate , which are going to be human to the doors of people who are going to send their daughters to schools like in southern kenya ?
the world changed .
i was in my office , my desk was scottish , i had the blue blue , the blue wall of the walls .
and there was even two of them .
there was really what was happening .
how amazing is that ?
now , i want to talk about some other patients , and i want to talk to you about a few other patients , to improve health care .
and then i realized that the side of google earth reminded me where we can fly to each address .
we are , you &apos;re the most involved resource in health care .
the seawater is a water factory .
here &apos;s the resolution . a wonderful creature , right ?
they don &apos;t take your environment with help , right ? i &apos;m talking about the most important .
in the united states alone , the annual cost would be in a more valuable way of the annual cost of 22 billion dollars , and bats are actually going to be able to get wealth in any case .
why should we be dealing with aging ?
if you go out here and look at the night sky and see this beautiful flying animal , i wish you smile . thank you very much .
europe had to be used in economic development .
the boom of resources pumps the water &apos;s water , not all , but many countries of the bottom billion .
so what &apos;s wrong ? why is it that &apos;s called &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; ?
and so the countries are taking a very , very highly common policy .
a few economists just came on time and said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try a auction ? you &apos;ll reveal the value . &quot;
in this moment , in the world , a billion people in poor or more , in the world , are stuck in the world , and how can we help them ? the economist paul collier shares a learning of a , compassionate plan , with which we can
we don &apos;t have a container where they &apos;re made .
here he is offering a english champion surgeon in africa of this notion that is required to get to care of treatment interventions .
so , we have this : imagine , imagine , they thought they were going to talk to a lecture and they could talk to people in their native language .
&quot; basics of laparoscopic surgery .
14 years ago , i first came up with this regular material , and i was used for this very , very much , in the same way .
he asked me if i could build this as a piece of a piece of the city .
so we were experimenting with little plastic tools to create a dry fog that is shaped by wind , and then we saw that he can be shaped by people who can interact with it and move through , without being able to get a more integrated .
they were in their dorm grass , they saw the underlying pattern of the world &apos;s face next to people who didn &apos;t know , and they did the wonders of the wonders .
and so i was also worried about that , that this is an enormous risk for our society .
when peter is moving his arm , this yellow spot is the fact that you see there the point of the position that &apos;s in the brain in the brain .
if you do this , what will you want to control ?
and to say that these changes are also about death , even a claim of a fact that is true or wrong or wrong .
now let me just clear what i &apos;m not saying . i &apos;m not saying that science can be a guarantee or that we have scientific answers to each other of the moral question .
now why wouldn &apos;t this be an objective morality ?
how much is the probability that this is a summit of human development ?
on the left , you see edward atwood .
we live in a world full of technologies , and these technologies can &apos;t be dismissed , it &apos;s always easier to break up , as they put together .
but then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
and what is his natural enemy , what the means of the good bugs of the good bugs that we talk about ?
it &apos;s a parasite , not a water , but a plastic of the iranian , two mm long , a long , and dominant , and agile .
and if we &apos;re doing these good things for example , for example , in a square of a square , they go to the flowers .
for example , where we &apos;re on 1,000 acres -- that &apos;s 10,000 israeli , which is a biological pest -- using biological pest in the air system , 75 percent of the pesticides were saving .
third , to increase the farmers &apos;s consciousness for the potential of this kind of thing .
and it &apos;s one of my favorite things .
it &apos;s still fun to make the difference of the rich fun than the other thing i do , and i do it often .
urban aid &apos;s -- that &apos;s what the new york needs .
her name was a little bit of a sudden , and so that was -- i was not a good enough to say , &quot; take the drawing . &quot;
or also the soviet union found only some decades , maybe within a decade , after time , to the soviet union , was most powerful .
because there &apos;s 80 percent out there that really eat insects .
they &apos;re at the beginning of food food .
why do we actually do these balls in the soup , it &apos;s still meat in it ?
it &apos;s 25 pounds per person , per year .
so , we &apos;re going to decide to do this for one , or to five kilograms of output .
we can increase them a little bit of rainforests , but it &apos;s going to be soon a limit .
and you may think , well , they &apos;re not available yet .
my three minutes haven &apos;t begun , right ?
he said , &quot; allison , we need to put them on the table .
and i saw a sign .
even if canadian that system is going to do it , they do it in a way that &apos;s going to be concerned about society .
and in this book , the little lewis would find the great idea .
this is a video game . and on the back are some other gadgets , and the scales , and scales to make some calculations . okay ?
right . so , this device is going to be used .
there &apos;s a quality of interdependence and precision that is just amazing and remarkable .
so the first robot i want to talk about is strider .
this will only be used to show that if you have cameras or other sensors because it &apos;s high , it &apos;s a meter 80 , you can get over obstacles on the strings of cloth and the metal .
for example , in this case , even though the left and the right wheel is connected to a single axis and so quickly , it &apos;s going to turn very fast .
welcome to the robot , the robot mechanics of the arts &apos;s industrial tech . &quot;
but the cool thing about this is the user interface .
let &apos;s see how he does . this was our first attempt , and ...
but what is the secret of our success ?
but only from a spark of imagination is not enough .
on this kind of thing , education is very important .
and the math that is going to be used to be a lot of ...
there &apos;s basically no resource of good people , and only eight percent of the county has a little bit about a more sophisticated or a higher degree .
there &apos;s a total empty on creative capital in bertie county .
the goal of the game is to have all the tags sitting on the wheels , then the team won .
but in the last few decades , a lot of money was a lot of money that was defined for college shop .
and after that , and the neighbors interview what they buy , and where they &apos;re going to buy , and why , a homework homework .
in this case , it &apos;s really impossible to create large tides .
i want to invite you to follow my journey of the ted journey and explore .
after four months of season , it came out and now he &apos;s eight months before .
here &apos;s a couple of results .
this global action leads to climate change , as it is fossil fuels , perhaps even more than that .
when i learned about these two things , i was very , very , both of the personal reasons as well as scientific reasons .
it &apos;s a very good job of the most powerful , which is partly the ronald of the ronald foundation .
so after treatment , we &apos;re doing a series of simple design strategies to see a series of simple design points to see how his vision is fit .
the answer is , in motion , i want to show you the next video .
i had to discuss long with my wife .
we &apos;re going to track these research studies and hopefully have more results to report .
and then , i &apos;ve been looking at these kinds of things that i &apos;m physically interested in , and i thought , oh , i don &apos;t know , but before i &apos;m paying attention to judgment , i &apos;m going to look at how this is .
but that was in the fall &apos; 95 and then as the winter , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , aimee , so , it &apos;s been done to the special 1996 , and she &apos;s very excited . your family travels with -- it &apos;s a big thing .
i tried everyone i could , who i could , against who , on the cover of the line , so against who i &apos;m going to go here ?
i &apos;ve always won everything and i thought , what ?
you can be big . take a simple . &quot;
so , aimee and the designer will be at ted pei 2 and we &apos;ll talk about the design .
she got somebody who came over and the shoes .
but it &apos;s almost impossible to see the real losses of the economy , it &apos;s because we use math .
or to the 75,000 jobs .
and another thing about the mathematics : mathematics sometimes looks like math -- how in this example -- and sometimes she doesn &apos;t -- how &quot; am i drunk ? &quot;
in math education , we use about 80 percent of the time to teach people how to do step three of their hand .
if people ask me , is that true ?
but the charter in cars allowed to separate these things , so that &apos;s what driving this is going to be something else , as a car and learning of his nest .
totally wrong .
but i think we can do both at the same time .
and one of the reasons why that &apos;s so important -- so , it &apos;s very important , computers in the test .
it was winter in 2009 , and i &apos;ve been blind for about a year .
i was particularly thinking about my father who was dying of an association , and i was running from complications in the brain .
similarly , just by attacking the handle of the soil , the changing nature of the soil , and with time , a notion of where you &apos;re and what you &apos;re interviewing .
but when i was being compassionate , and the broadway went along , i was blessed at every corner .
if you design a city in the blind of the blind , there &apos;s a lot of jobs .
to give you a sense of this experience , the article was called &quot; i think you don &apos;t think . &quot;
and the most famous , the famous one i knew -- the 10 commandments , love your next , was fertile and more energetic .
you give money to a good purpose and creating emotional , and it &apos;s about emotional .
she &apos;s not a book written , and it &apos;s written by heaven .
so , this is actually the key to me , to remind you that i &apos;m going to be here , that the car is not going to be here , and i &apos;m not on the road on the stairs .
that was very inspiring for me .
so if we really want to make a sense of this book , we really need to be on it , and we &apos;re going to be able to share with him .
so we have this wonderful progress .
the academics who were doing this work was to be able to get the work to be able to do , so we developed applications like this , the most powerful thing about a laser of a laser on a laser to a laser .
alex was working on a small , something obscure , independent , independent report with the name called &quot; minority report &quot; for steven spielberg , and invited us to develop a interface that should be used in the movie .
we &apos;re going to lead these online surgery through because we like yellow and we like to be yellow in green .
let &apos;s pull it apart : i &apos;m going to bring it into a little bit of a time .
we , as humans , are the ones that make things and we should make sure that our machines help us and build it .
john , thank you fiction fiction for reality .
what okolloh did would not have been possible without digital technologies .
but here is the point . the most creative creative act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that are shown by this black line said , &quot; we &apos;re changing this deal immediately .
they &apos;re created by the members of the community for each other .
and as all the good news sets do they make a leap from 20 years when the interest change the audience .
you didn &apos;t always have five days to get there , so changes and we started playing a little bit more like a little bit more .
but india didn &apos;t want to play at the most of the time .
the other was indian cricket .
it was the new india ? this was another world where you could get player from everywhere , as long as you got the best player for the best price .
we had a games in calcutta , but we had never seen anything yet . and , like , we had never had the audience with a song with a song for the molas -- for calcutta , not for the most of india , but for calcutta .
could you imagine that this day would come from ?
hopefully i &apos;ve made any of you to do a sense of experience , and the game is more popular and hopefully there &apos;s a longer time to work in this business .
and you know that the answer is , because they &apos;re very quickly in memory , they have a little bit of their memory , as often they saw dogs and pigs on the rope .
why about all the world should anybody play lottery lottery ?
on the other hand , if you visit a developing country , and you can buy a country &apos;s worth of sale for 25 dollars , it &apos;s a big mac for a big mac .
would you spend their remaining 20 dollars for a ticket ?
i give you an example .
and when the way to go to the other end of the city 100 bucks , it &apos;s worth 100 mice , no matter where they &apos;re saving . but people don &apos;t think that way .
now , in the big and all of it , you &apos;re extremely impatient .
watch what happens when we &apos;re going to skip the street .
dan , i &apos;d like to hear more . so , you say , that our answer is terrorism , i mean , he &apos;s a kind of mental mistake ?
there are no guns going on .
and so some people are looking at economists as dumb people .
and the variation and variation is one of these most amazing , which requires a certain intellectual activity , because you &apos;re always comparing the variation to the subject that you have in mind .
&quot; in words , and in fashion , the same rule and a lot of great , and it &apos;s really fantastic , and it &apos;s not the first one to try and do the first one of the old that was the old one ever since . &quot;
and i woke up one day and said , &quot; well , maybe that &apos;s not like that ? &quot;
first -- my willingness to give me a critical audience , without suggesting i &apos;m safe .
it &apos;s my intention to cover the poster , you should not understand it yet .
so , in the big and all of the time , they &apos;re saving our survival .
jews often have a uncomfortable smell .
if the space was knocked , we could see that people were going to pick up more negative attitudes to gay men .
it &apos;s as if i &apos;m going to talk about what i &apos;ve done in these 20 years in the distant length of this .
it feeds my mind and my soul .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends , other filmmakers , and they talk about what cinema means .
without food , i was sick .
we don &apos;t need any problems to get out of the bill !
our government was corrupt .
so for me , the idea that we have all these kids , it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of children that have been so much psychological trauma or damage to africa , and africa has to live with it .
and through the whole book , more than an hour , more than an hour , and interactive animations .
what is the business of doing ?
it had at least the evidence that you were still , in fact , largely true .
so i thought , &quot; yes , that &apos;s a good idea . &quot;
the talk still is about it .
when i came from college , i worked in southern california , and you &apos;re going to go to the spanish school of the roofs and these things .
rsw : how does his schedule look like ?
the most important thing -- they have interviewed me for interviewed and sent their technical power models to bilbao .
that &apos;s remembered me .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; so what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
if you &apos;re going to run four months to walk with three months , the ideas are always more likely to get more clear and living .
and one thing i wanted to mention at my favorite of my favorite , but somehow missed all of the companies that helped me to get the opportunity to get .
but meanwhile , these things are winning momentum .
and this is 10 weeks later , by hand .
you see the suits , the most delicious .
the very big thing about narrative and things is remarkable , and this is what you should be doing .
it &apos;s an incredible endeavor , 15,000 workers , i think , the sixth of the city , and the sixth is built here .
on this level , they work about 1,500 workers .
50 percent of the computer on the world is going to be recycling in china .
it was quite unusual , stefan , that less than five percent of advertising had a picture of a picture .
and wish three is : &quot; i &apos;m told , &quot; i was told to make myself a little bit , and i wanted to have a commitment to this .
and it &apos;s increasingly more important that we can figure out how to get these resources from these extremely complex complex materials .
the traditional ways of dividing materials is simply not for plastics .
the traditional way of making it happen is to go through oil or petrochemicals .
at the end of this process , we have a mixed circuit of the water : many different kinds of plastics and lots of different qualities of plastic .
now i see a lot of the math reports out there .
and what we see is that people tend to commit mistakes in the same way , again and again .
maybe we should study how monkeys make economic decisions and find out whether they &apos;re doing the same stupid as we .
here &apos;s an emergent . it &apos;s going to be a token against food , waiting for a single way , and you get your food .
they &apos;re waiting for something that is open up the market .
now imagine that i &apos;m putting a thousand people in the hand , so 10 of them are going to be a hundred bucks in the hand .
you can either choose a loss of loss -- so , i throw a coin . you &apos;re going to get a coin .
if we put the same in our little business , the same scenarios , would you do the same things as people do ?
the person on the left is a safer loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just the people on the last stage of development , making dumb mistakes .
and that &apos;s the catch .
but if we think of buildings , the most commonly only four stories are high .
we have to do less with concrete and steel and we have to build higher , and we &apos;ve worked on the ground in the last time .
this is just as much , as we have less cars in a year 900 to the streets .
so , the curtains curtains of the window .
maybe &quot; citizens , &quot; because recently they got up to fight the decline of the justice justice . the citizens of these networks work together to help each other .
so , the biggest and oldest bank in russia , largely in the property of the russian government , is now using , now , to try and multiply employees and citizens in the development of innovation .
we heard talks about ted , who have been using their plants with subtraction , and the most powerful process is to motivate people to motivate young people to create websites and turn videos .
and so i started thinking that the eternal mother always asks himself , &quot; are all the kids there ? &quot;
this is compassion .
he asked them to convey a message , and all of them read in their own language , a central version of the golden rule , which was , &quot; what you don &apos;t want to do , you don &apos;t want to do that , the most important thing
and being a pastor is to take care of these individual needs .
and we do this by some examples .
there are over 180 messages in washington d.c.
it &apos;s taken from parks and sculptures .
it &apos;s made of plastic fibers .
there &apos;s also a few constraints on its lighting .
the bubble is a very reactive .
i saw my aunt raped when i was only five .
one of the things i witnessed when i was trying to eat my friend , because we didn &apos;t have food and we were about 400 .
as a child , as young and delicate , words that i can &apos;t forget , don &apos;t forget .
this is my story , shared in a lesson of lesson .
my breakfast , my lunch , i &apos;m preparing a foundation that i &apos;ve started , because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give the farmers tools .
audience : yeah !
the third chapter is another more complicated tool called the &quot; federal war dread motivation . &quot;
that means more than 60 percent are for it .
we &apos;re going to solve the best thing that we &apos;re doing by increasing the problem of death .
and even if that happens , it &apos;s not too late .
i remember nothing from time when i was five years old .
santa claus knows if you were good or not . right ?
but , julie , you were so ready for school . you were so ready . &quot;
they looked at each other and smiles , in the sense that was the right answer . then they asked them , &quot; do you believe that we all have brothers and sisters on this earth ? &quot;
maybe your bigger ability to cooperate and adapt to it ?
i think this film shows the hardest look at the modern times .
in world war ii , we had to produce a lot of stuff .
but we cannot forget that it needs a fundamental contribution , and that &apos;s how many resources of the planet we use .
but now to the good news .
it &apos;s maybe in latin america .
and at this point , the skeptic and the climate change in the appearance of the world is in the appearance .
we &apos;ve done a project for a few years ago , and a big program , it was called the most powerful -- with many , many people -- many experts were involved -- all of the experts were involved in -- a serious shift .
a group of them are asking them , they spend it for themselves and they should spend the other group for others .
when they went from the first building to the second , all of a man , who was going to be loyal and went and went and get help , and the question is , did they have to get up and helped ?
the word is &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; , a combination of &quot; the &quot; and &quot; the &quot; s &quot; and &quot; the &quot;
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &#91; a &#93; , which is that the hidden life was independent things .
since -- it &apos;s now four decades -- now , i &apos;ve been trained with the best in this area , and i &apos;ve been trained with the best in this area , and i &apos;ve been teaching , young and old , and i &apos;ve created a wonderful web
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my real life force .
i danced between the rescue and the shooting and the respected and the accepted to fit this on my computer .
well , it was essentially frustration .
this is like it was at the time .
he put it together , which is combined to something that was put together , and then he convicted it in this software that i think was originally designed for son , and he has created this wonderful presentation .
in these documents , there &apos;s little little boxes , small boxes .
i want to suggest -- yes , do you make a beautiful website . how could i say you shouldn &apos;t make a nice website ?
now you ask the linked data that you put together , 32 hits , which every one of the protein is with these traits and you can look at them .
and it &apos;s linked to data .
all this is going to be that every year , two million children die less than in the year 2000 .
and if it &apos;s so , are we ready to collect feedback and give them to make sure that the promises really are giving results ?
you just show one of the numbers there , the 5,000 -- is that the number ?
my brothers started to draw me for draw and paint .
and that &apos;s exactly what fascinated me to explore this area .
how many of you have a cow going on the road on the road from bangalore to mysore ?
it &apos;s just that we &apos;re trained as humans to perceive reality , and that makes meaning .
and they said , &quot; okay . &quot;
can &apos;t you make anything , you &apos;re artists ? &quot;
this is a box of a box of plastic .
because if we go through someone , we see the footprint .
what percentage of that have been made of foreign science ?
obviously he sat in a cave last 20,000 years .
so the foreign is really hard to get here , to come to the conclusion because -- if you think about it , i &apos;ve been told today about the economists , i &apos;ve been told about economists , that most things are very , very popular .
this is the place i showed you at the beginning .
we &apos;re going to be a technical .
think of toyota .
you can &apos;t cut it on the ground , so you accept it and you find a way to work with it .
it &apos;s very hard to agree .
it &apos;s a little bit of a time and the water .
pizza is going to get them when they have hunger .
there are millions of different types of water .
so remember , if we think about sexual education and activities , they are out at baseball .
it &apos;s from the poet &apos;s name of chen and goes like this : &quot; i can &apos;t do it .
and that &apos;s , &quot; how much percent of the day you think of this person ? &quot;
over about 175 societies , people have come up with these kinds of brain cells .
they came home with the percent of dinner .
and it was really a strong force .
and i said , &quot; why do you think men are more powerful than women ? &quot;
no time at that time , the women were so educated , so interesting , so that they can do it .
she &apos;s taken her 23 times since she was 13 .
i started to get myself in love with why you were in love with one person than the other .
they &apos;re going to be as long as the human race is on what shakespeare called &quot; these butterflies . &quot;
but unfortunately , i know it .
most researchers believe that obesity is the cause for insulin resistance .
maybe we should ask ourselves if it could be that insulin resistance is the cause of weight and carbon disease -- at least most people ?
other people , it &apos;s too much more sophisticated .
peter strudwick : what if our views were wrong with diabetes ?
my great grandfather , henry ford , believed that it was the mission of ford motor company , and the life of the people who were making the lives of people affordable and make cars affordable .
and the good news is that today we &apos;re dealing with the big problems of cars and environment -- not just ford , but all of the time .
i think you can imagine it already .
but what really inspired me is the possibilities that we &apos;re going to have when our cars start communicating .
we need a infrastructure that is able to support these flexible future .
this is a minute 59 .
i think now my mother , i &apos;m like this kind of kind of thing .
the nurses have to be put on data .
this is really important . it &apos;s a lot . &quot;
so what &apos;s going on ?
and for us , it was great , because we won a lot of prizes .
i was infected when i was 17 , when i was a student , i came to adults , i saw adults who really believed my ideas , and i was drinking a lot of the most powerful , and i &apos;d like to drink a lot of the food
now it &apos;s just about the kids . so we don &apos;t .
basically , we gave the kids a simple task .
for our auction , we have some wonderful pictures for them , for a really good purpose , the money that they give us to buy hearing hearing .
but what i never said , and what i want to do is , i want to say , is cool .
in a way , in a kind of elegant or more available product , there are a lot of the time that we have called the most powerful morning , the most powerful , which is another kind of development -- and inspired by the incredible kind of input of
if you think about the change in our society , the most prolific of the country in the cities , the 200 years of the world has taken the same process in 20 years .
it was changing , although these were still unknown .
so , for example , we would put the models under an artificial sky .
i think a reduction in the square percent for nearly buried .
and as we do in this growing world , something is more important to some places that i &apos;m talking about -- china for example , that will build 400 new airports .
and this is the focus of the world &apos;s talk -- there &apos;s no lighting in the positive sense that is healthy and nurture our well-being ; without adequate darkness .
unlike the first office , i showed you the beginning of the talk , this is a very famous office office , which is that the most important thing .
and you see the most important building , which is later a icon of modern engineering .
i think what you &apos;re seeing here is quite amazing -- how much light in the sky goes and never hit the ground .
this is not very pleasant and more sophisticated .
they &apos;re not going to censor anymore .
if our main time , as a few weeks ago , a war in a third of india was uploading about 200 , about 200 more of india , who are the most prolific , he &apos;s never done the topic .
and one day -- i don &apos;t know what happened -- while i was walking home , i saw a prayer , or it came to me , i could be like a honey , i would be wonderful , it would be wonderful .
anil gupta : but what &apos;s going to be used ? what was it used ?
to do what ? to break stones .
that &apos;s the only place where you could express your creativity .
they don &apos;t want to have a second choice of standards and the water .
and this is what &apos;s made of the most powerful thing .
i had to be my favorite .
mr. merchant , who lives with a physical challenge , is 50 inches tall .
so , the math company , the most delicious .
this is a little bit of a time .
these are 3.2 billion people .
or ski . it &apos;s just fun , and people love to do it , and do fun things .
so we &apos;ve been very , very hard , but we knew that it wouldn &apos;t be so hard to develop the technology of what acceptance is about , and how the technology can be used .
cars are not made for each side side , and it &apos;s wonderful to go to them between cities and drive , but think about it , but think about it : we &apos;ve solved all the problems in terms of the range and speed .
so if we could add this box to a few years , we have a solution to transportation , electricity , and communication , and maybe drinking drinking water in a sustainable package , 60 kilograms of it ?
implicit or inappropriate is that people who die there are somehow involved in drug drugs , and we &apos;re going to take that right to the fact that they either tortured or professional or professional or even both .
go back to los zetas as a bond of psychopaths , which is the fear and horror in cities , and the press to the silence is to bring the press and the hell is too much .
mexico and the u.s. is now on a truly international organization that has been associated with the manufacturing production in the south and the global sector .
but also , part of it , a billion dollars of the world -- you live in the future , and we have a long time .
and after you fall under a critical price , you tends to be successful , if you &apos;re successful , a critical mass of light , a breakthrough .
but they &apos;re going to be very , very cheap , and look at the interesting effect , if they &apos;re cheaper , they lose the brands , the most powerful and the things that are the most important , they win .
if you look here , linux is in red , it has 20 percent .
&quot; open source is really , you know , the gift of the silicon valley system .
because of some of the technologies we &apos;ve talked about .
patient capital works in between and trying to take the best one .
the second thing was to be very cheap .
president obama understands this .
because one of the poorest farmers in the world had found access to a technology that allows him to change his life .
and yet , this is exactly the properties of the men and women being honored by all generations .
you remember , while the most popular was reported in his blog , the hurricane of the city , and he often had him . that was just possible because blogs are easy to use .
i like music , and i like to do a little bit of the time , and i think i heard steve martin play and said , i can do it .
i wrote this post , and i took this because of einstein today .
and you see this post .
these little things are just .
and maybe i have to have a lot of time because i &apos;ve been running on this .
it was widely edited up since the generation of our generation .
we need to use this process immediately to get a better understanding of how the oceans work .
we &apos;ve studied these fish carefully , but we had to learn how to keep them .
but it &apos;s just half the size of the largest tuna that we &apos;ve ever tagged .
they come together . it could be sex under tunas , and there it is .
you can lure a lure -- it &apos;s like a seal -- and a white shark will go to it , a little bit of a little dense creature that comes down very close to our 16 foot .
and then we give these animals a encore by helping us help .
and the white shark .
i think he didn &apos;t think that the record of my pop line were so precise .
they said , &quot; besides , what &apos;s going on , you &apos;re talking about groups that are going to harm the u.s. ? &quot;
you don &apos;t have to waste your energy .
now , who &apos;s looking at my favorite view , i see that i was there , and i know that i was in the ninth of may for $ a day in the safeway of the morning .
and every few moments i &apos;m putting a laser tag on my life .
when i started the project , people said , &quot; why would you want to say , what do you do , and where you are ?
now it &apos;s very normal .
now , look at this kind of thing from paris to see how incredibly fast growth is .
i &apos;ve looked at thousands of these things , and trust and efficiency are always critical elements .
how do we copy how to face the face of the face ?
i was kind of a mind in the system .
this page is going to be a day , and 80 percent of them get a precise answer .
i want to start with a paradox .
and here you see him in relation to the level of inequality that i showed you , and i &apos;ll come back to that .
first of all , the rich developed countries , and then in a second phase of time , with 50 american states -- with the same question : do the more unequal countries go worse on all of these scales ?
with devastating effects , what &apos;s going to be about talent of the population .
and in our analysis of american states , we find the same contrast .
the social judgments are taking , and fear of these judge .
or for example , why violence in more unequal societies is more prevalent , because people are sensitive to becoming surprised .
a year , more than three million microbloggers a new knee , or a new knee .
you remember , kamal was the most important thing .
if you carry it under pants or a rock , or a sari , it &apos;s very clear that you &apos;re wearing a prosthetic , and in societies where disability with social stigma is being brought up very sensitive .
so thank you very much .
you want a dirty magazine ?
i actually bought the most sophisticated thing , and there &apos;s a little piece of paper on that , &quot; use this kind of thing that &apos;s not going to be made to put juice . &quot;
this is the result one to the 20th percent , &quot; a google just &quot; is so many &quot; o &quot; as a result of the pages .
strong fear is a very strong .
but if you were always in this condition , the work would never be done . because you would suddenly say , &quot; oh , i found a new way of doing it . &quot;
almost everything we do is subconscious .
it &apos;s about being safe in this world .
if the park &apos;s was diagnosed , and would fall apart , then you would never go to a ride .
it &apos;s a very small sample -- so you shouldn &apos;t be distracted .
i &apos;m going to talk about children and self-organization and a series of experiments that made me think of the idea of a alternative education .
and at the night , 70 children on the internet are in the internet .
so i could even choose to meet a cross-section , to cover a cross-section , which is partly the whole world .
what you &apos;re seeing is , there &apos;s a child doing this , that &apos;s a kid .
natural systems are all self-organization : galaxies , molecules , cells , cells , societies -- except the discussion of the theory of intelligent designer .
and it &apos;s about idealism in this whole space of the entire ocean .
i bought a nice suit , and i was wearing shoes with a little suit , and i was screaming to the remarkable access that i had to do .
but 2002 , when my tour went to end , i decided i didn &apos;t go to the job that was waiting for me to go back to london .
i felt that something had been destroyed .
and i went through . i went through these numbers .
and i traveled to kosovo and gave the government to the government .
independent diplomat is part of a trends that come from the world to come , obviously , and shows that the world is fragmented .
it &apos;s terrible that they are that people who are actually affected , not to be dismissed .
this is the politics of the 21st century , and in a sense , independent diplomat represents this kind of thing that &apos;s going to happen with us all .
&quot; hey , could you get to me more ? &quot;
because if we go back to the street , they understood through these practice that a simple mistake can say what you can &apos;t , or remember why you love something .
we feel awe , pity .
go ahead .
what is the number one ?
no . in the &apos; 70s , the evangelical show , the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the 1973 , &quot; the northeast of the last 10 , followed by &quot; the &quot; s &quot; and &quot; three angels for charlie . &quot;
i can choose it from the island .
and i &apos;m really pleased to talk about you , i &apos;m going to come in and say , &quot; can someone please explain the real idea and why that &apos;s so cool ? &quot;
next , this virus is producing the whole thing that &apos;s covered the bacteria .
from a series of reasons .
or even worse , scientific education is always going to be more like the guy who always says , &quot; actually ... &quot;
but we have a lot of work before we do and when someone in science is involved , i &apos;m going to ask you to talk to me .
we go up the stairs and we experience a state of consciousness .
so many books about war , the same thing , is that nothing people get together as war as war .
durkheim believed that everything we have together is a sense of sacredness .
he kept saying that &quot; the &quot; s and the &quot; s people don &apos;t get together and can &apos;t be moved without any of the cracks . &quot;
he uses the other .
once they were all in a same tribe , they could keep the benefits of cooperation for themselves .
it &apos;s about connecting to other people to get to be ethical ideas .
jh : thank you very much .
i realized that , i &apos;m not just going to be able to be a lot of it .
and right next to the garage , he has his own family , where he can be in its achievements , which is a more important role in the field of state .
everything is always easier to do in design , and here &apos;s this kind of thing , and my god , i just photographed it .
&quot; the end of print &quot; is now printed for the fifth time .
this book is called &quot; the &quot; s &quot; -- it &apos;s a different word for quotes .
this is actually an experiment for a client , and it &apos;s a client that we made a sequence of six photos and tried to put people over the print of the internet .
they said that people didn &apos;t like them .
a paper about brian chaplin &apos;s -- a really boring article -- so i put the whole article in the back of the world .
somebody told me that there were these things that call the folder , but i don &apos;t know what that is .
this is pretty high for most professions .
before that , there was obviously no technology . but obviously .
this is not another planet . these are things hidden on our planet .
and finally , i come back to this kind of thing .
this is a very popular thing , he was with stephen jay &apos;s theory of the theory of the horse .
we &apos;ve heard of the data of the gun that we have to give up guns .
and i think that &apos;s really important . because if you can imagine mozart before the invention of the technology of the world &apos;s invention -- what &apos;s going to be for a loss of society .
octopus &apos;s first time i was very young .
he &apos;s catching up again , takes a full of gravel , and it &apos;s going to go back -- &quot; the most powerful , &quot; the same thing , the same thing .
but the point is , we were there for a month , and i wanted to get the animals to get used to us , so that we could see their behaviors without being able to bother them .
and if you go down to the bottom , this is the lovely blue water that you &apos;ve left to start and have always been more fond of the time and the other .
but there &apos;s no sun down there , there &apos;s no photosynthesis , it &apos;s a world &apos;s place down there , which is a bit of a sudden , and it &apos;s all so volatile .
but i &apos;m very careful , but i &apos;m very careful .
everybody talks to each one . then it &apos;s not a little bit more available on a map , then it &apos;s a network that we &apos;ve created .
she was a tedster , and she and i didn &apos;t go and go and get us like little girls , and she didn &apos;t buy me a pink clothes , but he knew , he didn &apos;t know , he knew , he knew , he knew , he
my parents left , and my sister was arrested .
cities are the waltzes of civilization .
is there a horse in edinburgh ?
we &apos;re going to behave with our entire economy , shown in the corner left : the middle of the road .
the heart rate is reduced , and you live longer , a piece of energy , and nutrients through the membranes , etc .
all of the most important things , but the most important thing that &apos;s the equivalent of the energy is the equivalent of the metabolism , bigger than one .
they grow quickly and stop , part of our own energy .
looks like a computer program .
children in the 12th grade are less excited about political systems .
he had been talking to a high school in our high school .
my students made these incidents as a result of a task that we asked ourselves in terms of oil oil .
this is my favorite story , because it was done tuesday when i was going to go to the student to go to the vote .
and this is the same thing .
you could actually -- -- we don &apos;t go to this .
it &apos;s a video game .
and he asked a very important question .
and i &apos;m going to show you the 15 million dollars .
you see the stem cells again .
many of these patients are broken .
the european union , the same .
and even though i don &apos;t have patents , so much of me , they will be meeting some of my inventions today .
you know , of course , what that means .
and they &apos;ve been doing all these progress in so short time , and they &apos;re all so young .
thank you all .
in school -- in fact , i have an organization that makes a sense of a design system , you know , how you &apos;re going to do it , you &apos;d really like it and so .
she was also very nice , but she was so full of a lot of anger .
my daughter -- my daughter wrote this , she told me , &quot; start your talk with humor . &quot;
i &apos;m a cartoonist . &quot;
i want to hold your hand .
and then finally , i finally got a call , and i was going to talk to you about the next year i was going to speak .
and i thought , if i could write books , where these world were small and connected , maybe i could maybe people who affect us all , and maybe even move to better than better and to make the world better .
and john said , &quot; bet for good people who do good .
there was no specific media company focused on the public interest .
i thought the problem came in in a little bit of time .
i learned that there &apos;s not just a proper way to change change .
what do you think how many police officers are on this taxi ? well , three .
now you see that . this is the most important thing .
yes , the medical advice of the world &apos;s day , &quot; yes , i &apos;m told you , you don &apos;t know , i can &apos;t see that , i see that . &quot;
this is our first patient , just out of the front of the world , and now look at this chair .
these are the most important of my device , or our original process .
i have to serve . &quot;
this is in the scottish parliament parliament .
they &apos;re putting them on a very special diet diet and they treat them with big care .
his app was only made when he won the most sophisticated price .
but there were a lot of debates in tunisia , as a result of how to get this problem mr. .
so we have the situation in the world today where more countries are going to be given the relationship between the citizens and the government , which is being managed by largely private service .

i &apos;d like to introduce you to mr. venkataswamy .
they affect our bank site .
i mean , if i &apos;m a good job of mine , i have to believe that there is a reason for it .
this was very promising . they didn &apos;t want to go back to the beginning .
it has been waited since 1960 , as a designer hardy , a marine biologist , said , &quot; i think our ancestors lived for a time in the water . &quot;
but it &apos;s just a way of connection , but it &apos;s only in a direction .
and then the fact that we &apos;re rotating .
for example , professor of a professor . he understood it .
so if it comes and when it &apos;s going to happen , who is it going to hold it ?
first , i want to be so eager to get out of the way that you can do it .
yeah , i got a couple of years ago .
you see , in other people &apos;s lives , and i have the feeling of the way i get a lot of inspiration from the user .
this is called &quot; atheist . &quot;
online , you &apos;ve seen a lot of it .
and the most powerful and ray of ze ze frank is a very highly popular and tells us what it is to do with passion : people help , with little , more cosmopolitan , and interact .
the answer is pretty strange .

and every time i &apos;m talking about what i want to do at least , i &apos;m going to address why body matters .
so this particular instrument is called the most powerful instrument .
they shrink and melt at the same time -- and some are very , very disappeared .
that would not be a big problem , because if we were in the state of war , we would be buried our arguments , all we would do , and we would find a way to find them out of the way , and they find a way to
this is data from the ministry of congress , and they show the most important prediction of what would happen if the current conditions and trends continue .
the rock is holy , and when people circle together , they connect , they can trust each other , they &apos;ll be one .
so the most important and the most sophisticated knowledge for which you should be voices of voices .
for many reasons , the decades after world war ii , the second world war was a historic time .
there we are as a country .
we &apos;re going to be a nation with two classes .
this is really a social disaster , and the liberal is very concerned about it .
but they don &apos;t exist yet . so i have to make them .
they &apos;ve been in the architecture for ancient periods of time .
you see this kind of thing that the protocell is actually moving away from light and moving to the dark .
it &apos;s been made me almost three decades of hospitals , and i &apos;m probably very proud of the most proud .
instead , i &apos;m a hotdog professor for law , psychology and psychiatric in usc gould of law , i have a lot of good friends and a beloved husband , and i want to have a beloved husband , who is here today .
i quote from my record : &quot; i had torn up with my classmates and val on the friday night in the front of the night , where we wanted to work together at a homework school .
they were getting to me and they found the legs with a bed bed .
i &apos;ve never met a nuclear record that would have agreed .
i could let you go back to me immediately and we could make it very , very private , ha ha .
the american prisons are full of people who are hard mental illness , and many of them are there because they never have a proper therapy .
so we decided to build a different car program .
these are four billion hours of being missed in this country .
and i was just saying , &quot; there was a lot of water and not very many people .
the montana in montana already did a lot of things to reduce their water use , but they still use millions of gallons of gallons of water .
he &apos;s paid for that to let the water in the stream .
i don &apos;t like to have a problem , without suggesting the people who work on the solution , so i want to highlight here , like &quot; mad men &quot; and movies like &quot; &quot; mad men , &quot; whose female characters and the ethical are complex .
his name is matthieu .
i know there are other businesses in the world , but google is the environment that i know because i &apos;m already 10 years old , so i &apos;m going to use google as a case case .
so , it turns out that google is a company with compassion because googlers find that compassion is fun .
there you come in the morning , and you have three colleagues who choose to make a hospital in india , to build a hospital in india .
there are three steps .
and i hope that compassion is also going to be a lot of fun for you .
but one day , the perfect case came . it was a very , very much a person who was sitting in front of her house .
i met myself with one of the most popular , which was doing the training of the world &apos;s office and justice , which is the normal tendency to the defenders .
people often tell me , &quot; you know , this is wonderful , but it &apos;s highly valid .
in the same way , you sometimes experience , if you &apos;re sitting in the new yorker subway and you read this , this is a light that &apos;s easy and easy feeling .
different parts of the world have a touch for different things .
and at the same time , the beautiful piece of internet design , which made these beautiful transformations and the most cosmopolitan of the plastic .
but the objects are touching the full of full plastic systems to this kind of water , it was really very broad in the water .
even this chair you open and then put yourself , so you get the writings of the kind of stuff , and that beautiful series of objects that are viewed as a design of jamaica .
what does image mean now to do with this ?
instead , they developed a very interesting approach to my education -- that they would send me to a school that they could hardly afford to afford .
my last story , and i have to go a little bit .
and he died when the ambulance was walking around to bring him into the hospital .
blogging is a way to be blogging to do that .
so let &apos;s just jump the leap .
and we need africans to start our leading politicians to question .
my cousin was not able to afford to do the school school anymore , and she &apos;s very smart .
and if you don &apos;t take you , then with which what doesn &apos;t .
it was a total country divided in public and religion .
so , our political problems .
local leaders and future leaders became shaped .
he helped in parol at a birth .
it &apos;s the heart of medical care .
i &apos;m going to sell this simple clinic in every clinic .
now , when i got this , i was -- press the air press -- completely except i understand ?
now , in a few weeks , riley will be a big girl .
and as you can see , the life expectancy was just a moment .
the life expectancy has been on azerbaijan .
this is the absolutely best technology for this region : sakena .
let &apos;s start with the water .
but they have to share with the world .
the generation y is going to seem to be .
100,000 people gathering together to nonviolent march and a idiot or a idiot , and a rock , and guess who &apos;s caught from the cameras . this one guy .
and it &apos;s also about humor . humor is such a strong force that can turn the game into the game , and he played a very large role .
now , the most important thing : how is it going to go on the arab world ?
and she said , &quot; i saw your talk in live .
i said , &quot; if 500 or 2,000 will become 1,000 or 2,000 , my life is over . &quot;
there &apos;s nothing more painful than that .
and i see them .
and everybody broke out in applause , and she said , &quot; yes ! &quot;
i know your father was never in a prison room , he was singing .
the other thing that you need to know about shame , it &apos;s absolutely organized by the gender .
i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
we want to be with them and to them .
and if we jump down and then we go ...
if i fell in the rice , i couldn &apos;t see that .
this helped us create a very ethical and very strong organization , and a system that they supported .
we have a simple digital camera in a plastic company , and we can make a very , very much a time through a doctor for every patient .
our annual rights is very quickly , which has gotten us a healthy profit , which is a healthy profit , and that &apos;s even a lot of people for free .
this is a difficult task .
for example , we can add digital content with physical mass .
wouldn &apos;t that be a way to make mobile phones intuitive ?
it was as if they didn &apos;t see me as if i had become invisible .
and also , nobody ever heard a cup test , or saw that play , and this is what the creation of new ways of seeing , his and knowledge , because now you have this concept in your head .
as it is in bp , the hole is suspended , at least temporary , but not to demand a huge price .
don &apos;t be ashamed of that .
and it &apos;s also the story of modern capitalism , because it was the wealth of this country that has been shaped our energy system , a system that can &apos;t survive without the growth of the world , and the other thing that can &apos;t survive .
the oil is not liquid .
now , you may have more headlines like this notice .
great show . man , that was good !
bf : ... like the left .
dh : all right , please stand here ... please please .
rw : can i hold him ?
dh : just power , do you say ?
dh : then go .
dh : the french judge ...
dh : i &apos;ve got -- ... -- to put the club down there with my handle from steel .
bf : six . dh : this is world record . bf : this is the world record . dh : for us .
he &apos;s less known than the two , because he had this idea , mechanical design , and never built one .
but if you look , you would see something that &apos;s very , very similar .
this is from a paper that she was using .
there are plans .
you know the problem that we don &apos;t want to believe what we know .
we don &apos;t want to believe what we know .
second , freudian and julia , and the most cosmopolitan and vivian , and diana , and the army , and the army , that &apos;s love !
now , 13 years in the wheelchair , i have seven years in the wheelchair , i &apos;ve done more in life than it was outside of him .
over generations , we have our children as well as millions of other species that live with us .
but it &apos;s not a normal movie .
if i took exactly a base of this screen on every pixel of this screen with the resolution of the steel , we would need 3,000 screens to take a look at the genome .
what does this mean for medicine ?
and so he sequenced the genomes of his children .
it &apos;s because there would be somebody in the audience who wants to stop eating .
imagine , in 2016 , the leading candidate is not just their four years of greenhouse income revenues , but their personal genome .
and so i ask you all , you know , the world &apos;s and the genomic revolution that &apos;s going around you .
and we have a flexible knife , powered , a special knife , a special , which remains in the solid part of the world &apos;s land and moving the edges of the hip .
hopefully it will allow us to see this technology , more of the more survivors of these survivors .
on the stick , which is the rehearsal that &apos;s lit up a switch of gas , and motts dies .
so , it &apos;s exciting . it can be done the least possible possible possible possible possible , so we can actually capture some new particles .
the most famous charge is the electric charge .
they say , what change are possible .
but that &apos;s how unified theories work .
many people think it &apos;s the most beautiful structure in mathematics .
the only way to get his mental health , in the middle of all of the uncertainty , is to get and happiness , is to maintain the balance and a perspective in life . i have have a perspective .
the patterns of dots that i showed you actually describe symmetries of this kind of thing that &apos;s going to bend , and that &apos;s going to be moving and dance and dance on the ground of space-time .
and we also heard about the story of the family , from the bloodline of humanity through genetic .
in the most competitive , we find a lot of examples of compassion , worrying for love and real altruism .
most importantly , i think it &apos;s to work with small groups of women , giving them the opportunity to get the shot of the sun &apos;s recording .
and you know what i mean . i &apos;m talking about pollution .
take the most important for all the problems that we have to do on the planet , in terms of the environment and in social . it &apos;s a message of hope .
and optimists and the same things , and similar things , which young people hear better from other adolescents than adults .
this change , these change . change , change , is that if we care about the future .
working with the plastic , about the first eight years , some of my pieces would start to fall down and break into smaller plastic forms .
recycling . every one of the time about the book about the same book about the idea of recycling .
so i &apos;m here , and unveil our youngest and most successful trial , which is in the middle of the development .
the author of the book is juan , our favorite of our favorite , the way it &apos;s super exposed to amazon .
and at that time , we knew that this was a political thing .
i lost a child , a second , a second , when i was 16 .
i know what it means to suffer , and if a crime happens , a person should be fair to pay and flourish . &quot;
but what if that wasn &apos;t that ?
but after a few of the prototypes , i thought , but i was going to end up with the bottle bottle .
add that . you &apos;ll add that .
okay . the bottle bottle is used by thousands of people around the world .
or we could use one of these here .
mao tse tung described her as the european civil war , and that &apos;s probably a more accurate description .
my mind , by the way , ladies and gentlemen , is that this is probably not possible by the state of the other species .
they start to see the evolution of a world &apos;s population .
but this is not the case .
the interdependence of nations , well , we always had .
but now one last thing .
but if you ask the question of the sound , how the optimal formula for a long life is , it might not tell you that .
it reminds me of my college time .
and the research is that this years of largely free , it &apos;s about chronic diseases , heart disease , cancer and diabetes .
they have what we want .
we &apos;re at half .
and for a while , we looked at the processors in the liquid , where there are actually a high proportion of consistency .
instead , they talk about the next trip in nature , trade recipes , and yes , they pray .
it &apos;s been done in nine days of time .
they tend to feed themselves .
for the little example i &apos;m in here in hand , we &apos;ve used a nuclear record that responds to my skin , and that little light is shining .
so often amateurs , no experts , the inventor and the other of things like mountain bike , and the same of the things that we have -- computer marrow , computer transplants , airplanes ...
and then computers were still big , big things that were really interested in , and no one dreamed of it , one of them to have one of them at home .
you just have your eyes to come up with it .
i mean , he was already seen .
so we &apos;ve been looking at the driver &apos;s driver and studied .
and i said , &quot; i can &apos;t get them , but i can bring them into zero zero , in zero gs . &quot;
we had four main strategies and two nurses in the airplane .
and actually , you can see some images , because i don &apos;t want to see on the screen .
no life , from the smallest life to us all , would be without these little micro-machines .
i invite on a street party . i went to eat food .
i didn &apos;t change . my iq was not down .
i was a writer .
so , no one would be able to accept planning when you don &apos;t survive .
and then we decided , why not the religion , because on the philippines , the catholic church was right , and the president was the russian church .
we did our first favorite of 1975 , and the women were going to have organized , and the women were just trying to borrow the family planning .
you can call it the coca-cola approach , if you like . it &apos;s exactly the same thing .
and then aids , in all schools , started in the university .
and then here , with the american flag , &quot; don &apos;t go home without home . &quot;
these are things that are made of business .
can you imagine , in every starbucks , you can get condoms ?
he can &apos;t be scary or scary .
so i &apos;m going to make a picture .
you can simulate this behavior in the browser , which romo is doing right now .
i want to tell you about my four minutes of the ted project .
people like you all here in this room .
she went to a giraffe , like a giraffe in the african savanna , the flag on your shoulder , and i came up -- on the front of the -- on the front of the box , the flag with his arm , so my head disappeared under the
i &apos;ve worked with women and women for women .
jenny is clear that the only solution to getting the bad teeth .
it brings the women to plant new trees and to access to the lines , drop for drop .
women and children , especially the poor , are very low .
if you sell too early , you &apos;re going to get the profits , but if you wait too long until you &apos;re waiting for all , you &apos;ll fall down the course .
you can see the tips , but you can see .
the challenge for the most important player is whether he believes the other is fair or that it &apos;s going to be too little commandments so that it &apos;s just one or two dollars to be available .
now i &apos;m going to give you a few relatives .
we can try it . maybe we &apos;ll .
so what do we learn today ?
about 10 calories , about 10 calories to produce a food that we consume in the west .
so how ate a city ?
and in the middle of the city , in the east , in the middle of the east , they &apos;re offered to sell for sale . that &apos;s why it &apos;s called the &quot; s . &quot;
and at this point , our relationship is completely changing both of the food as well as the cities .
the word of general is doing thomas moore .
so , there &apos;s a lot of desalination piles .
we need to understand that the world is also what we eat .
it &apos;s the source of all morality , this imaginative act of the most elegant act of the world , to make itself in the place of another .
and i see that this requires a tough intelligence , not just a sense of a sound .
in the current manufacturing economy , we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years of industrial science , half a million parts , pretty complex , new and exciting technologies from steel , concrete glass .
the next project is , in question , and looking at the passive nature or the passive trial , making functional processing processing .
basically , you have a chain of elements .
when i was in hinduism , wisconsin , i was a public talk , a group of students who were at school school .
often , we &apos;re looking for the federal investment of grassroots disorders like flu .
there are unknown everywhere around us , and it just waiting for it to be discovered .
could we now turn the light off so that we can see it ?
so we &apos;re chemical , which is different , and our kind of chemical , kind of , has universality .
but there i have to confess -- and i &apos;m asking to bear richard -- that i never liked biological power , and i think we &apos;re going to deal with a few hundreds of millions of years .
everybody &apos;s talking about action , a reduction of the energy emissions to dominate each price .
he realized that it &apos;s possible to issue different laws that allow the economy to have small profits to have the incentives to win , to win more customers .
both are dark in comparison , like puerto rico , which has half the people who have the most common people than haiti or the classmates .
to one of these zones next to hong kong , shenzhen .
people can come to live under the charter , but nobody is forced to do it .
so much of the understanding of the brain &apos;s understanding is that people can share on rules .
how would we write such a deal ?
you thought in genomics a little bit more than 10 years ago , you &apos;ve sequenced that year between three and five genomes , and it &apos;s already hundreds of things .
if there &apos;s a lot of non-zero-sumness , they &apos;re very much of the green light .
the number of genes spread a little bit when we ignored a little bit of a parasite , and it &apos;s still bigger when we focused on certain kinds of genes of genes on the top of genes .
it would be added to a surface of radiation , which has broken its chromosomes into small pieces of pieces in the two to 24 hours of each other .
let me conclude with ethical and political studies .
of course , that &apos;s worth waiting to be a marshmallow .
we call them &quot; basics . &quot; you focus on what will be .
and it also occurred to me . i grew up as a poor child of a family house in the south bronx , and everyone lived in the past and in the present .
let &apos;s take medicine .
here &apos;s a beautiful picture of the most powerful , the largest largest , high school in your milky way .
it &apos;s cold , and it &apos;s a cold , and maybe it &apos;s raining , and maybe you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a corporate of a football system with a little bit of a time .
i can &apos;t tell you how this was , the first pictures of the probe of titan , and this was what we saw .
so here we see a film from titan , which shows these dunes , these dunes are 100 feet high , and they have a distance from some kilometers , and they have a distance of a few kilometers and increased miles .
now , the earth is still the only planet where we know that it &apos;s all over the way life .
they &apos;d lost 40 percent of their country , and they &apos;d have been a free access to the rest of the west bank .
so , the most peaceful march .
so we organized a demo .
it just took four days to do it .
and the rest of the brain is made of neurons .
on the inputs of the hippocampus , you actually find cells that are going to be able to be able to see the hippocampus that are just reacting to the boundaries or edges in a certain distance , and towards the rat , if you study the environment .
and this would be shown by the fire of the brain &apos;s fire .
he wasn &apos;t the only man who had a u.s. woman who had no arms , and he was definitely not the only great speaker of his time .
and why would anyone care about it ?
people don &apos;t buy what they do , but why they do it .
the neocortex is responsible for all our rational and analytical thoughts and language .
it &apos;s always the same three things , so let &apos;s look at it .
and if you talk about what you believe , you will attract the ones that believe what you believe .
the reason that people bought an iphone in the first six hours , for six hours in the queue , was their worldview , and her will , and her will , and they were the first one . they were the first .
people don &apos;t buy what they do , they buy , why they do it , and what they &apos;re doing is just as proof of what they believe .
and , by the way , he thought , &quot; i don &apos;t have a dream &quot; i have a dream &quot; i have a plan .
i will never forget how cartoons in the house of the screens are going on .
when this is the office for the training in washington , d.c. , the coal clinic , they were exposed to the clinic .
and we decided to use recipes to this purpose .
what if we had a waiting room in which you don &apos;t just put it out , if you &apos;re sick , you &apos;re going to get healthy .
and they leave these with the belief , the ability and the efficiency , our most fundamental hopes in health care .
i think that last , when we value our health care , it &apos;s not about the sick , it &apos;s been cured , it &apos;s measured , but it &apos;s the diseases that have been prevented .
it &apos;s a real danger for these days , but this is in the indian ocean .
we caught it with this kind of thing . it was six tons of cocaine .
85 percent of you can &apos;t read if you enter the afghan state .
multiply the energy system that uses the economic cooperation with silk force , as security can be created in the world completely different .
do i really .
remember , this is a fun of me , when the most important thing was , you know , count the dots for tony , count the dots for bush , count the dots .
the bubbles represent the countries .
some countries have already statistics .
but we need to take a whole piece of the u.s. to take a whole piece of the same way to find the same health that there are today on the philippines .
it &apos;s changing .
this looks like a happy story .
what you make here -- on which altitude they live -- put their daily ones .
it &apos;s about having food .
it &apos;s this stupid concept of developing the developing world that we , argentina and mozambique , and he said that mozambique has evolved worse .
governance . a functioning government -- that led california from the northern pacific of 1850 .
and i showed the approach , how this seems impossible to be possible .
and the enemy pretty weak .
we &apos;re -- despite skepticism -- with ease in afghanistan .
&quot; it &apos;s not an ideal world . &quot; &quot; and their government doesn &apos;t get us closer . &quot;
how would a rule of rules look like this ?
and what we need in the back is a solar company .
do you want a better system ?
and the doctor told him , he just didn &apos;t need to move it .
&quot; who &apos;s going to attack us , risk the world &apos;s end . &quot;
the leviathan force is just left out of his pen .
it &apos;s a little bit more .
air force , strategic colors .
thomas barnett : a new way to peace
i don &apos;t want to get them too out .
here you see the most important in the early stages of water , which brought a lot of sulfur into the stratosphere with a kind of nuclear weapon .
this report ended up at president , and i was at president , two years old . in 1965 .
but let &apos;s say you have sunlight , which hits the particles and it &apos;s called hypercard carbonate .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to happen . it &apos;s not very likely .
there &apos;s a way to go beyond this scenario and move away from the current climate .
not just about how we do better , but what are the risks and side effects ?
here you see a fish with shining , recyclable eyes .
really incredible . here are two males fighting .
and so i came up with her kind of pride , just two days ago from the himalayas .
but if you look at the literature in east and west , you &apos;re going to find incredibly different definitions of happiness .
well-being is a deeper sense of serenity and fulfillment , a state that actually absorbs all states and you &apos;re going to be able to get them to all of the subjects and all of them and all of us who can be given us .
we know that we can be able to be in something that we can be called &quot; little paradise &quot; and in addition to it , and it can be really unhappy .
the mirror allows , but the mirror is not going to maximize it , it &apos;s not going to change from these images .
and once you do that again , your tendency to get the anger up , to keep the anger up with every time you disappear , lower .
of course , we do that with the objects .
we &apos;re ready to harness 15 years for our education .
it &apos;s really a huge problem for us .
it &apos;s a place . it &apos;s designed .
you can see exactly what happens , at night at night at three .
not just just a cartoon of the sierra nevada , not just a cartoon of the sierra nevada .
this is actually a television that &apos;s going to show the show , &quot; we &apos;re normal . &quot;
we &apos;re going to be -- we have a system that would be ashamed of the bulgarians !
one last proposition -- that &apos;s a moment for me for years , but i think it &apos;s particularly important for this audience .
at this point , we &apos;re about two days away from the entrance .
this is a little bit of a circuit of the cycle .
the ice can be between five and 25 miles deep .
the main time , the same way , is the beginning and the back , so that it can do new design projects while it &apos;s still in the eye , which has been left behind .
for that , they would pay 10,000 dollars in orbit .
and the point is that you &apos;re moving over 10,000 feet per second , when you actually want to go back to the gas station .
with the right support , it can be done in seven years .
i &apos;m going to take you to me , you &apos;re not going to throw me from the stages , because you put it .
they also formed a few companies where the brand doesn &apos;t work so well .
rb : no .
we have a video that shows you what you &apos;re planning , and virgin &apos;s in the air .
he wanted to go , he would jump , or he just said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go away ? &quot;
ok , that &apos;s not hard .
i mean , here are a lot of legos that kids have , and we have this dilemma , how to get them to get them out .
rb : our favorite joke , that it actually , we have , &quot; forget the priests , &quot; is the sex of the sex .
for 30,000 people filled our forms out of our paper , and they said they would try it .
no , i want to live my life in all the money .
