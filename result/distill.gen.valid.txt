if you have trouble , what that means for the average consumers in the u.s.
if you want a fish , you get a woman and if you need a woman , you get a fish . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a longer ride , you can still change the battery , and you &apos;re still going to go on the island .
this is after today &apos;s population , the u.s.
in india , you don &apos;t understand where the problem is , because most indians are only two or three gallons of gallons .
everything we need is 10 percent of the created energy .
we &apos;re not going to sit in it immediately . maybe we &apos;re going to get the kids free and keep the slaves .
the arguments of the so-called id is the same old arguments that were always , and again , they &apos;ve been getting more likely to be the day since darwin &apos;s times .
the most amazing natural selection is so amazing because they &apos;re the problem to explain complexity , in form of nothing else than simplicity .
now the next one : the president of the royal society has a strong internal belief , &quot; -- -- &quot; -- that a asteroid killed the dinosaurs . &quot;
she feels in a very reactive minority , but how are the american atheists in fact ?
i have no numbers for the other fields of other fields like history or philosophy , but i would be amazed when they were different .
darwin was the opinion that atheism was right and good for the template that the most important people , but they &apos;re probably saying , &quot; not not a lot of it . &quot;
if people like -- if atheists , like stephen hawking and albert einstein , the word &quot; god &quot; use &quot; god , &quot; of course , they use it as practical metaphor for this deep , adopted part of physics that we haven &apos;t understanding yet .
and the start cost about 500 dollars , about the value of 10,000 today .
and in wireless , in wireless a person , the license , you have to be able to be in a field and it had to be found if this was on license or a property .
only because there &apos;s a certain sense of view or a certain sense of how to be involved in wikipedia , ) , a certain sentence of social relationships .
i have no slides , so you &apos;ll have to be able to get to me .
a study of the world &apos;s research has shown that there &apos;s a clear thing in 28 african countries .
the state should not be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be inefficient and the services , because it &apos;s inefficient and depressed on this area .
but what it &apos;s going to be approved to be the dominant , the ones that were dominated by our economic development -- that if the oil oil was high , our economy grew up very quickly .
the same thing we do in the world &apos;s world .
and i would have noticed that you can see that here .
he called them , &quot; massive fatal , &quot; what means that you could kill to 100 million people in the next 50 years .
and we didn &apos;t have to know how a vaccine was exactly done .
the main challenge for these two viruses is that they &apos;re constantly changing .
these drugs are not cure , but they &apos;re going to represent a huge triumph of science because they &apos;re the automated death penalty of a half of the time for those who have access to them .
but you know , the research that has been done in hiv has helped us to do with the progress for others .
this was a slow , a process of the process , which was dependent on chicken , millions of living chicken chicken .
and the radical increase of production and the vast of the e. is the e. method of the e. , for example , about that i &apos;ve just talked about -- look at the food of time -- that would be the time .
so the challenge is full of power .
the question is , why ?
do you think the african union will organize such a conference ?
there are some things that you have to know .
the speaker , who was on the stage , was the , the wmap mohamed , adopted , that we had the leaders in africa .
by suffering it from your suffering people .
traditionally , africans hate governments -- they hate the memex .
they decide what they do .
he doesn &apos;t get help from the government , and he &apos;s building a second , bigger boat .
something that would connect us all together .
scott &apos;s results were full of it .
and the challenge for algorithmic filters , these personalized filters , is that they &apos;re going to go to this balance because they &apos;re going to go to what you &apos;re going to click first .
it &apos;s supposed to be a new ideas , and it &apos;s going to be new people and strangers .
and the man said , &quot; very beautiful home , what ? &quot;
i know that they &apos;re waiting for more bad , and i just do fun -- but now only a short repetition , and then i &apos;ll show you new material about possible solutions .
until the most likely in may , it will give a update on version 2.0 , where you can get directly to buy the purchase of the water .
even at all republicans here , it should not go to the way that it &apos;s going to go .
what i really impressed to the gulf of the gulf is that they &apos;re a little bit of the time .
and there &apos;s actually no more , except a few people who try to use the beach .
we heard that bacteria eat oil ?
these are the entire ocean that &apos;s all the ocean .
when the japanese pearl harbor harbor harbor , they were at least back .
what the oecd of birds are , i want to do no more sophisticated remarks about people who clean birds .
okay , people who call themselves a conservative , if they really wanted to be really conservative and right , they should send these companies to the most important .
it &apos;s right and wrong .
and i developed a system to produce medical stewards .
okay , &quot; i &apos;m more than my genes &quot; -- all together .
i don &apos;t asked you to get it to the way it &apos;s true , but to remember it .
they contain a molecule that we know as a brain .
and that &apos;s just a kind of a kind of a single one . it &apos;s a lot smaller than human .
well , neurons , like trees , can grow new branches , and they lose old branches .
and we can even talk about the most popular .
if you &apos;re going to celebrate these numbers , you can easily make it a big potential for the brain in the brain .
maybe this technique will be able to meet ourselves through the way we meet ourselves through the other brain and put our own brain .
he &apos;s mostly working on music videos and ads with his company , the most powerful .
so we &apos;ve been prepared to be prepared to show you a quick experiment to show you that .
ks : no , not yet .
while he did that , he noticed a unexpected thing .
ks : so how does it work : there &apos;s a matrix of the most powerful .
ridiculous , right ?
and a few months ago , a friend sent me a link to this guy , eduardo sousa .
a huge deal for a few weeks .
but he still did .
so his farm is incredible .
and then he found this wild plant , which is the most profound plant .
and then they fly in the circle .
i finally came to try to try and try and try and try and do it before i went .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no consultants .
what hell is that called this ?
at least . i think .
farmers that are leaving in nature to find solutions , rather than finding nature .
and from the old fire to change , two big stories , and to change the oil , and to change the two fifth of the fossil system in the air .
our fuel for mobility is three fifth of cars .
you can let it calm up , it &apos;s tougher than titan .
trucks and airplanes can use realistic hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
also better light and the same thing , and so much more dry , the maximum world &apos;s maximum .
in about 20 , private oil cells are very compelling , private solar cells without financial losses , and they reduce their own losses .
and what we &apos;re always communicating is it will be in about the same cost : about six trillion dollars in the brain system -- although we buy more of what we have or new nuclear and a new nuclear and a new power , or renewable , which are more or less centralized .
so , on results , and not incentives , to focus , it can lead to the way that we can lead to the world &apos;s disease , and the conflict of the energy of america .
later , i realized that what i had eaten two , two of his family &apos;s family .
these simple things that are the fact that donor cells are in areas where the least kids go to school , not a schools , and this is what makes new questions , and it &apos;s going to get the help that they need most ?
two years ago , at the eight years , i called my father .
i &apos;m not trying to design the toothbrush .
we remember , and can we look at the book of my favorite son , that life came four billion years ago -- four billion point of point ?
so , i &apos;m not quite sure .
there are risks , there are a case : the vertical .
you &apos;ve got time to think of it , and you &apos;ve been talking about art , and you have things like that .
you go back to the future , back , back , back , so .
they &apos;re all coming from families where they &apos;re just one person at home , mostly the mother or grandmother , and they come to their education and their structure .
we bring them to the right and on the left , so they can follow and know the consequences when they &apos;re shaking orders .
let &apos;s go all online . &quot;
it &apos;s predicting .
they said , &quot; it &apos;s enough for the design of the .
then you can support us . that &apos;s the task of you . &quot;
but i have to have my monthly .
you can listen and join .
so , for example , let &apos;s take the most powerful .
if you think about wikipedia , in the one of the content , you &apos;ve been working on the content , and you &apos;ve been building the biggest encyclopedia of the world .
there are many people who have the same dream .
a website was created .
there was no leader .
extremism has become tolerance .
the modern tools of neuroscience shows us that what happens there is a incredibly complex process .
we can keep the sound of our own language apart , but not the stranger languages .
we were facing the american babies who never heard a second language , at the beginning of the critical phase of the critical phase .
it may look like a computer of mars , like a half of mars .
science on one side has a very rational approach to their environment , while art usually has a emotional approach to its environment .
now i &apos;ve got a school program over here to show you that .
let me demonstrate this over here .
the dalai lama once said , &quot; love and compassion are more powerful .
the glass of the glass were burned by a little girl whose body was burned .
it &apos;s part of every human being .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we choose to do compassion ?
the wound of the maggots .
suppose you like squares , and honestly , who doesn &apos;t like it ?
we start with a computer and then we &apos;re going to ask another more powerful .
then there was a little bit of plastic dioxide , a computer company .
i am , &quot; he &apos;s already dead .
&quot; i have what &apos;s going on ! ? &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t have a juggler . what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what do you do here ? &quot;
so i went into the lobby and saw this indian guy .
marco tempest : if you asked him deception , he said , &quot; magic is the only job profession . &quot;
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to demonstrate you how closely terrorism is connected to our daily lives .
and at the time , when i interviewed the red brigades , i also discovered that their lives didn &apos;t have the ideology and politics , but by economic constraints .
i think many people thought i even thought of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
but especially they went into serious , and they were in serious .
this money was in a lot of time , and the way that it was in the bar , and the bar , understands .
nobody wants to control the world &apos;s favorite , and his favorite one is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do his own .
some of you may think , &quot; wait for time . you don &apos;t necessarily see how a computer of a computer .
clearly , i wanted to leave my favorite , but what i didn &apos;t have seen was that it &apos;s extremely uncomfortable to leave his favorite , his favorite .
and i really learned that , the bigger the challenge , the bigger the feeling of a special performance , if you get to the end .
well , i thought the atlantic was big , but the pacific is really big .
but that wasn &apos;t without a computer designer .
it &apos;s these little green disk on the horizon , which is very nervous because of the rising sea level .
we can start to make better , more sustainable decisions .
and the kind of thing that i &apos;m talking about is why i &apos;m going to go across the pacific .
this is the world trade trade on the cover .
why ? why ? why do you want to do that ?
he doesn &apos;t see a surplus cost . he doesn &apos;t use additional time .
they were able to make that .
and last time , it &apos;s about comfort , it &apos;s about the good thing that you feel good at all of you .
and that &apos;s hard when you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i asked myself , how do you be so easy to give my dreams ?
it &apos;s not so hard to do somebody , and one day before school , i said , &quot; yeah , you can make my homework , &quot; and i gave him the wrong answers i had in the night .
we both were in the back of the class in the class , so we wouldn &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
maybe you brought your own and you brought your teeth , but never told you , because how can you say , if you want to say , if all around you , you want to be buried around ?
this is french science .
well , then .
if you look at this truck here ; it &apos;s the largest truck of its way on earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the largest and the fastest growing of co2 in canada , and it &apos;s also the reason canada now is the number three is in terms of the number three .
and as a father , i can &apos;t imagine what that &apos;s going to be done .
by doing that , we remove a big part of our biggest , and replace it with most greenhouse oil , and the future of the future .
the most important of their work is the uncle you can buy in every store and the millions of indian women every day on their forehead . it &apos;s about a ritual that &apos;s deeply with the institution of marriage .
and the shaw shaw was born in the world &apos;s office , in the nanoscale , and in london .
i hope you can convince that complex and complicated is not always the same .
the most important thing is , the one we want to affect -- the public support for the government .
so i proposed to my first tedtalk that we should spend a planet 21 billion hours a week with video games .
only 30 minutes a day , a day for a significant improvement of the mood , and the joy of joy .
why a game ?
how could a lot of a huge effect could be so serious in so serious , sometimes , sometimes , in the very serious , sometimes .
there are four types of strength , or resilience that are doing to minimize growth , and there are scientifically of the scientific shifts that you can do every day to build this resilience , you don &apos;t need trauma .
and more practice is being fixed .
here &apos;s another secret for you : if you shake your hand six seconds long , the most powerful in your blood will increase the most powerful .
and in this project , we actually have hundreds of people around the world , and they &apos;re doing that with us , and actually , thousands of people in this project are involved in the project , many of his different aspects .
and then a few people came from chicago and said , &quot; end 2007 is the slogan of chicago festival festival , the global warming , and we want you to fill them up with your reef . &quot;
wool and the most important ones are not just two concepts that fit good .
and the caregiver asked , &quot; how can i define parallel lines ? &quot;
infinitely . they were going to be used . right .
so we have , from wool , the domestic , the evidence that the most famous thing is the most famous thing that &apos;s wrong in the math .
and their individual ideas , and their employment with this mathematical method .
this particular final property -- the confidence -- is my opinion of the holy grail of neuroscience , neuroscience , and eventually we &apos;ll understand what &apos;s going on .
this person is otherwise in a subtle mind and intelligent . but if he sees his mother , his delusion , he &apos;s not his mother , he &apos;s not his mother .
so if this area is damaged , you lose the ability to see faces .
tables and chairs and chairs -- nothing happens , as much as in normal people , if i &apos;m going to show him a picture of his mother , the most powerful activity remains low .
he knows that his arm is not there . nonetheless it &apos;s a compelling , a kind of a convincing experience .
maybe you can do this with the most important , the gymnosophist in the phantom .
and my pain is gone . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , the last three days i didn &apos;t have phantom , and therefore no more , no more , no more , no more , no more , no more , no more pain .
and the blue is blue , it &apos;s green , another tone could be yellow .
this is the key .
which is kiki , which is a fool ?
your favorite is to be a lot of time , which most of us don &apos;t deal with .
this is kanzi .
none of the things you &apos;re going to see in this video are the most powerful .
well , good .
he learned that when he uses both hands , he &apos;s using their own hand , with his specific , much larger and more powerful .
a frame is a hut in the forest .
look where the sound comes ?
because we believe that it &apos;s not the biology , but the culture .
and some stars die in spectacular varieties of rays that leave this remains .
on the right side , gravity is the gravity . einstein has explained this .
and it &apos;s going to take new species of change .
it was still too early , but he was a moral , inspiration for scientists who were worried about control of weapons .
let &apos;s see aliens , and we have seen our favorite point of the point of far outside in the cosmos , and not only for 40 years , but the whole four billion years of the world &apos;s world &apos;s world .
martin : is this our last century ?
and it &apos;s going to be worse : &quot; then i would make a picture of it and make a dozen of them .
well , these are students , so they gave a lot of money to things like the brush and crosses .
and then we asked them to get them to be happy .
but enormous different incentives .
these are the most powerful in belgium .
the teams that we gave money to spend it together , were in other teams , and they actually have the league of the sea .
if we hear today from the most violent , from the high , the high , we &apos;re often doing that , that this is another one of these most of the time of the middle east , whose roots are as old as the region itself .
ironically , this was a time to be the most complex of iran , and not the destruction of israel , and not the destruction of israel .
this is an analogy that &apos;s going to be able to be able to do diplomacy , diplomacy , is the diplomacy , is inevitable .
you can look at certain amounts of water or you can look at the different regions and compare them .
the map of port is not so good at the end of 2009 , not as well as they could have , not as good as the map of california .
the trick is :
and she said , &quot; he was not a legitimate . &quot;
this system wants to keep the status quo , also the status quo of a government .
so it &apos;s not that my theme is the most important thing . that &apos;s not .
we can &apos;t do anything . &quot;
lawrence lessig : we , the citizens , must go back to the republic back
for example , some people are going to be in this room , and for example , sputnik had been a scholarship to school .
this is at my pen . &quot;
everybody is just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
i don &apos;t want to say that the law of entropy isn &apos;t true , it &apos;s true .
here in the model , you see the attack of the brain .
if you see fireflies in north america , the like so many things are independent in the united states , they ignore each other .
everybody &apos;s going to depend on this critical region , the most important region , which has over the 10,000 independent cells , which every single , a electronic rhythm -- a high tension , a low tension , a low -- to pump a signal .
they were a while in the time , but then they were apart .
so i want to show you a few interviews with people who were opening up on the bridge and describe what happened .
now , you don &apos;t usually keep yourself for a hippie , but we &apos;re all running -- we &apos;re going to go back and walk back to walk .
im : this is just a few tons of tons , so it &apos;s pretty fast .
but the scientist &apos;s scientist in his area .
i didn &apos;t say what the list was , but she was in the order of order , and i told them , they should look for their name , their own , or the girls of their mother .
maybe this announced , maybe this anticipation or maybe a more powerful , which is not worth economically , a resilience against disease or an other property that is useful for climate change , and the other thing that &apos;s useful for climate change is , and the other thing .
we &apos;re going to be able to attract kids in television .
the idea with svalbard was that there &apos;s cold , so you have natural temperatures under freezing .
and if anything happens , you can come and pick it up .
thank you .
look at your body body ! this is not right .
maybe any lady , a lady ? thank you very much .
you &apos;ve just tried two concepts -- two in the united states , and one at the russians .
madness ! i have to talk about innovation -- the things that are developing , there &apos;s a lot of activity , and then they &apos;re going to be replaced by something else and die .
i can &apos;t tell you when it goes , because i don &apos;t want the competition to know my mortgage .
i mean something really interesting , that &apos;s going to happen .
ok , let &apos;s talk a little bit about the commercial development of the pop space space .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a few years , he &apos;s ready to give up , but one day he has a epiphany .
institutions are going to be &quot; naked , &quot; and if you &apos;re naked , now , the consequences , it &apos;s the consequences .
the fourth meaning of openness and the fourth principle is , is a lot of time .
the sidewalk is from the most powerful .
you know that bees and fish live in school .
all around us , a medical revolution is going to be a revolution that will help us defeat some of the worst diseases of our society , cancer with including cancer .
this is a tumor , dark , gray , a , a , a , a brain , a brain , in a brain .
and you can see that the ring of blood supply is going down to treatment .
but the real question is : how good do these in practice work ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add a computer system . it prevents angiogenesis on very effective way .
but more interesting is coming out of the study that men , the most powerful , so the ones that have been taken to the other tomato sauce , the bottom of the blood vessels , have less blood vessels that feed their cancer .
albert von the , once , &quot; discoveries is to see what all of you have seen , and think of what nobody thought has been . &quot;
i &apos;m a very reactive magazine in discover magazine .
it has to make fun , unlike everyday problems , which are not very good , and they &apos;re not very good .
this is the background of the other .
you can &apos;t do that physically , but it &apos;s going to go on a computer .
i wanted to make a sequel .
what direction will you be here ?
so there are games like &quot; brain republican &quot; for the nintendo , a computer company .
looks like a black character . where is this ?
i really think that a girl is so powerful , so powerful that we had to train all of it , not to be so .
i remember , for example , my father , who was very , very violent , i proposed .
we &apos;re so used to steal girls of the difference , to be their own life that we actually made them objects and they &apos;ve been transformed in the way they were in the way .
and she looked at your babies in your babies , and she said , &quot; of course i love my baby . how could i love my baby ?
when we were there , she did a ritual where they were girls who are the aerodynamic ones , with their families .
and i &apos;m going to be on your life on your side of your life . &quot;
i love that i don &apos;t take things easy .
why should you be able to get me to the way that you want to get me to be a little bit of a time ?
so , in the real process , all six teenagers were all told , and the most important thing they had made of the photo .
but the incident was in the middle of january , in the northern hemisphere , to the northern hemisphere .
this is 10 meters away .
and what does this example show -- what about it is to keep us in memory ?
he was a very religious man .
i got a computer and traveled a year through africa , where i asked people why they were built fractals , which is a great job when you can get it .
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to be on some villages to the smallest level .
it &apos;s not really mathematical knowledge .
he said , &quot; if i lived in the jungle , i would just use a long time , because it &apos;s very fast and it &apos;s very cheap .
and odd , odd .
we have a more powerful one .
but the bad news is :
instead of turning on friends or a relatives , they looked at the workplace .
today , agile is applied to a hundred countries , and it &apos;s going to be done until the most important .
fear of the master &apos;s school .
we &apos;re asking a few rules and hold them .
the conversation will run better . &quot;
just as i &apos;m going to get a day to come here to come here , i started to get a of my daughters .
and we developed 10 minutes .
i was a teenager when i first read &quot; anna &quot; and the famous first sentence , &quot; all happy families , &quot; all happy families , &quot; all happy families .
i want to show you how something is so beautiful to look at this .
if i put this into the water , you see a silver , and this is the most powerful , the water that &apos;s going to prevent the water from the water of the brain &apos;s water . it stays dry .
and plato with all the young boys in his cave . sweeney : the ...
i &apos;m going to show you .
but tesla &apos;s success wasn &apos;t from the duration .
one thing i want to do is that not all the cuban , not all the cuban .
we can turn them out or turn it out , and it &apos;s a turn , or make it .
he &apos;s one of five children .
i showed you that we can apply it into the circuits of depression in the mood of depression .
we &apos;re to understand what these circuits are and what brain regions are responsible for the clinical signs and symptoms of these diseases .
evolution is actually working in reality as a single one of a time .
this is enough !
what we &apos;ve discovered is if you look at the leg of a human , or the cockroach or a crab or a crab , the relative of this feather , the relative of the feather that we &apos;ve seen to now .
okay . the point is to say it &apos;s really hard to say , right ? it &apos;s incredible , students , and they couldn &apos;t say it .
he makes it with a computer glue .
what we do is we take the hair as a model , and imagine with another colleague from berkeley .
and that &apos;s the married of the married leaders , two thirds of the married men , but only one third of the married women are just a third of the baby .
at monday , i left san francisco , my favorite , and flew to this conference .
and we go out on the end , look at us and say , &quot; how did it go to you ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous study of harvard business school over a woman named heidi .
and i &apos;ve got my hand back and i fell in all other women , and then you have more questions , just from men . &quot;
a woman was screaming , and i looked at her -- she looked at something young .
thank you .
they don &apos;t do it as well as they should , but they do it .
so not fear of the defining factor .
but it &apos;s true in the middle of the black .
i &apos;m going to talk about this in the next thing , thinking about how we spread in this country , as we get to information .
so you &apos;re in clean , clear language , and that works .
we tell you that everything is fine ; it &apos;s good to you .
this patient is about 50 , so we can tell pretty precisely how big risk is to get prostate cancer .
they don &apos;t need the level of the audience in this room .
and this bee certainly had assumed , &quot; i &apos;m going to get this kind of thing , that flower , i &apos;m going to get the nectar and then i go down . &quot;
and if you talk about nature , that &apos;s a writer , how is the idea of the idea of the world ?
well , we &apos;re all equally different systems .
the only technology here is the cheap thing : pretty new , a car car , even in a car car , even i could close a more valuable one of 10 to 15 .
if a computer system is a little bit of the grass , the grass is going to be on this dry , and it &apos;s happening immediately something interesting .
and now i &apos;m saying that i want to build a layer of games on the top of the world , but that &apos;s not quite true because it &apos;s already in development ; it &apos;s happening .
if not , it &apos;s the shame . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
come on to a certain time , you get your drinks for half the price .
and then you can really achieve good kinds of good things .
and it &apos;s powerful .
and the one is a corporation that &apos;s trying to find the best news that &apos;s the best news .
we talked about a few years ago .
you also see , if i turn this around -- hopefully i &apos;m not going to get the world too much .
you can see , here &apos;s what it started .
this is one of our engineers .
so , the most precious student should have been teaching the law of the most powerful , just as a hobby , as a hobby .
raise your hands .
it makes it a place where it makes fun to work .
and that &apos;s why we &apos;re working on what we &apos;re working on , and we even have people who are excited about it and crazy enough that they &apos;re working on it .
thank you .
what the main thing that he said , for his passengers , was able to get the experience , the experience of the landscape .
what does life make easier , pleasant ?
and for part of the way they &apos;re doing this by building , instead of building a great new facility , the basement used of their hospitals .
today , the industrial systems of time have been the world &apos;s largest problem , and they have been part of the present problem .
and as the theme of the world , we can do that by having a bigger effect .
from my loving , the waiter was surprised by his boss .
mark &apos;s and i &apos;ve tried to have a series of studies , just to answer this question .
yet it &apos;s exactly what the american paradigm requires .
but for the european coast , the very promising availability of all these kinds of things on the market was like a computer .
americans themselves discover that unlimited choice seems to be more attractive than in practice .
and the parents would say , &quot; noah was just like , &quot; noah was just for so short time , but he taught us so much .
robert nye once said that , &quot; it &apos;s poetry that &apos;s lost in translate . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant thing of pink . &quot;
the three problems have one together : they &apos;re a lot of problems that are controlled by forces .
so , thank you .
it &apos;s supposed to replace competition through collaboration .
and then we build a more powerful thing that we can test the maximum performance of machines , and so we can be very , very quickly .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that the most important thing is that the best thing is that the best thing is , but as a little bit of a movement , it &apos;s a little bit of a time .
the bomb enters the stage .
and then the 92 nuclear nuclear nuclear nuclear energy would be able to deliver the energy of los angeles .
then you take it and you stick it on the screen of the surface of the house , and it &apos;s going to be out of the inside of the outside , right .
if you replace the word , or the internet today , it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
i think it was this exchange that led to computer .
ph : i hope you understand how to do this .
finally , the race has won the future to the future , when the phone phone is going to be .
mm : because it gave the audience a role to do something .
they produce things for 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute .
and where television has what &apos;s built , what &apos;s built is a very exciting new way of communication , and we have the analysis of two industries and a new way of thinking about it .
this is a spanish architect and designers .
color can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do simple materials : if i go through new york , i think .
it gave me a little bit of a little bit of a yellow day -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco and we all talk to us , and build some installations .
the use of the city for the public space is a lot of the time , is significant , almost a international model .
even the pieces of the airplane had french words .
he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s more girls there . &quot;
and that was , finally , as i , after some of the most powerful and the design of the chair , i ended up with you , which i &apos;m going to show you .
he said she &apos;s got one of the new things .
or they &apos;re moving up to the position .
and i knew , but i was going to go out of experience , where i was going to go to the offices where there was no one in the idea that anyone would come to the idea of the idea , and the head of the head to adapt to it .
and it &apos;s been distributed in the world &apos;s way .
two days ago , i can &apos;t remember that , i &apos;m not reading exactly , i read in a computer company that the first one has been able to have the first one , about 52 , about 400 , about 400 , about 400 .
we need something that was really a really powerful , so he doesn &apos;t spread the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : males hits female , every amount of offspring .
so , the biggest problem is not our biggest problem .
&quot; why now ? &quot; why here ?
and most of the time i don &apos;t take it , although i &apos;m a computer company .
look at the data data .
now , our mobile phones can now engineer a story of our own .
bill &apos;s : your health depends on where you live .
this is my grandfather .
from the simple reason that nobody talks about it .
as the beginning of the beginning , plants are going to move phosphorus through water from the ground .
here &apos;s a remarkable article from a remarkable article from &quot; nature , &quot; which is the discussion of the phosphorus .
eighty percent of it is like mentioned .
and instead of a dose of 100 percent , we take one of 25 percent .
we have a working technology and one that &apos;s going to use some of the most powerful things that we &apos;re going to do in the world &apos;s world &apos;s world .
and he was a so-called called a so-called called the so-called , and the mutations , and mutations to find rules and laws , instead of looking at the norms .
and in this example , you see that the individual steps , but they &apos;re going to repeat without being a more powerful .
as an architect , i just think of relationships between the pieces and all the time , but in terms of brain care , it &apos;s always more important for business .
we &apos;re listening to the level of the building , where we could build the five separate towers , but they should all be on the 60 floor to a single mass of mass .
let &apos;s come back , a few years later , in 2003 , and we &apos;ll see that this landscape is honest after the rainforest .
the difference is especially in the desert in the desert , or maybe the way they want to do it in the desert , whatever they want .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that were illegal , and now on the air .
we have doubled the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world , just by fertilizers , which causes huge problems in the water quality , in rivers , lakes and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the most important thing for the most important .
but we can do that and there &apos;s opportunities .
irrigation is the biggest largest largest world &apos;s largest thing on the top of the world .
need to work together .
so -- what is the system that &apos;s actually called the system ?
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
the whole system is not feeding control .
we interact with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biological property to amplify these kinds of things -- muscles .
so this is what it looks like .
here we are , or cut the nerve free , from small parts of the most powerful and made other people , and we were doing our own , signal , the signal , two other ones that we have -- signal .
ak : it works good .
but i can &apos;t put a electrode in the way , and i say , &quot; there &apos;s . &quot;
and that &apos;s our goal -- something clinically to wear .
this is jesse and he press a computer company .
so thank you very much .
sub-saharan africa is largely , because 22 million people live with hiv , that are more likely to be the 70 percent of the 30 million people who are infected in the world .
governments have to create effective , effective aspects of ethical aspects of clinical trials that are approved in the different developing world . the world &apos;s land is going to be the government , which is the government and the most common of the study .
the fundamental problems we are faced with is a too high consumption and too many people .
so they all meet criteria that people usually like .
so you see this electricity , which goes north -- the most popular in this case -- the to the galapagos , and that &apos;s the bottom , and this is the most powerful , the most powerful , which is going to go up to the galapagos .
we also know that not only is threatened by the same , but as penguins and other people .
so i want to show you that penguins are going to be moved in the world .
turbo has been a way to pat with his heterosexual on the door , and we &apos;re going to get it into it and he comes in here .
and then there &apos;s another one that comes out of the very comfortable .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we don &apos;t solved : our basic political geography .
the two parts of a very long frontier .
again , like mongolia , china , china is not going to be . it &apos;s going to be .
for the countries , china reduces its own , so that the most expensive and cambodia could sell their cheaper and sell their cheaper to china .
what i want to introduce you to here is i call a day , day , day .
these two arrows form a bow , a bow of the world &apos;s , and other infrastructure that connects the west bank with the gaza stripes .
a lot of them .
so what &apos;s next ? how is the future of european union ?
53 countries and far the most of the suspects straight lines on the map .
this dream exists .
it &apos;s bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like this .
okay .
and the hormone corresponds to the growth of growth .
so how can a hormone end the speed of aging ?
we think insulin and patee are hormones , which are particularly active in the circumstances of the circumstances -- in good times -- when food is there , and not much stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details about how it works , but we know foxo genes have a impact on life expectancy of people .
basically , you could change genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process of that i &apos;ve been talking about is that the worm is very fast , a different normal , different one , like a bird , like a bird , so that the bird can live much longer .
they &apos;re never going to see a display , because nike wants to buy that they buy their shoes .
they all show heroes that were the most popular .
it &apos;s like trying to run against a computer system .
this view is shaped that many of the most powerful things like prozac are essentially changing the chemistry of the brain as whether the brain was in fact of a chemical soup .
and my colleague colleague seymour believes that .
and we found out that a mutant was a lot more , much longer to get to the most important , and when we were the genes , and when we were the genes that were played in this mutation , we could discover a kind of a computer .
and you &apos;ve been asked to have a long time for a long time , but you can actually test it .
and so , mosquitos are finding us in the dark by making us . they smell us .
it &apos;s just you looking at it , that &apos;s the cheese .
people even told me that they &apos;re like to be fed by mosquitos .
in the world , in the world .
and every time i felt the most pessimistic of the eyes of the eyes of the eyes .
and as a lot of the time , fat is one of the best sources of adults .
while we talk about a lot of clinical trials , about the use of stem trials for the use of stem cells for the use of stem cells .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angels in the world , not just in our country : venezuela . in our entire world .
so what happens when what &apos;s not happening ?
but here you see what &apos;s really going on .
i can &apos;t tell you about it , because i stopped the headline .
and the sensitivity of the sensitivity : what you don &apos;t know about marriage
but how ?
it &apos;s even better . it seems that we can make this receiver , with the material of material , that in dna , it &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it .
the animal jumps , it &apos;s spreading its wings , it &apos;s going to take it , but it can &apos;t really take it , because the fly between two glass is caught .
for a intelligent creature like our fly , this rule is not in stone , but it changes as the animal is learning by experience .
so , by many of these experiments , we were able to put the identity of the critic until 12 cells .
there &apos;s a few ideas in the most violent and artificial intelligence , as you could do , but we still haven &apos;t solved a single example of how intelligent behavior of the physical interaction is living on living matter .
here &apos;s the most obvious , or actually a computer of the world &apos;s world .
ed : yeah . tb : okay . a little bit of a little bit of the inside , a little bit more to the middle .
and i know from your experience , i know that hospitals can be a very dangerous place .
here &apos;s a picture of my legacy of legacy .
one of the things i &apos;m telling you , this kind of care of care that includes everything , from their goals to their genes , will be the most important transformation that we &apos;re going to see in health care .
they don &apos;t stick like a velcro nor a velcro or glue .
here we have the robot .
marc , the most pessimistic was built the most powerful .
what would happen if you went to the bottom of the paper , and it would come to a little bit of a sudden or we would shake the sheet ? &quot;
and so , they also did . and he does this .
of course , as you can see that in a computer system .
we &apos;re going to look at the rising sea level .
and i would say , people are working in the ocean and think about the goals , we &apos;re the opinion of it .
this is the ship i was the last three months in antarctica .
if this ice goes down the sea level around six feet .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news for the corals are the galapagos of the galapagos islands .
you &apos;re the water water .
but then you see the most popular thing in black .
we have very interesting opportunities to have co2 co2 in the atmosphere , and we &apos;ve just done this with a little bit of the time , but in this case , we go back 20 million years .
and this is the task that einstein asked , find out how gravity works .
einstein has already been room and time , biases and curves to describe gravity .
but deep in the structure of space , the idea , could give it more dimensions than we see there .
and as the strings of a cello , they can be able to put different strings in different patterns .
not yet .
is this just an interesting mathematical construction that may be able to explain some of the things that are able to explain , and can we actually show these extra dimensions ?
so we have two plates here with colorful dots .
now , can the predator see the predator that is that it &apos;s going to attack it ?
and what &apos;s true for sensory information is generally true for all information .
and we look at about 30 seconds , which is a pretty hammer in a 18 minutes .
why ? because if the full thing in this shadow was actually in the shadows , and the same amount of light would reflect on your eye as the full outside of the shadow , you would have to reflect more -- just after laws of physics .
where do you know that ?
and she comes into the beehive , finds a blank , and the other thing that is , and that &apos;s honey .
he finds him . madness , or ?
do you agree ? yes ?
often there &apos;s no right or wrong .
in 2010 , in new york , not so much .
we &apos;re also a species of the storyteller .
now some things : understanding of security , the risks , the dangers , the way they work .
but in a modern and complex world , they need models to understand the many risks we &apos;re faced with .
think of cancer , flu flu , flu flu , sars .
there was no new insights , but less fear .
and there &apos;s another cognitive bias : i call it a little bit of a more sophisticated , and we &apos;re going to be able to accept the data that we &apos;re talking about , and the data is telling us the data that we &apos;re telling you about .
i was familiar with another group , whether my airplane was safe to fly .
this is the people .
and he was found in the near , at stanford .
they had good periods of teachers with their teachers , students .
let me ask you some questions to find out whether that &apos;s a good choice . &quot;
i took it to anyone , and i was going to get it to get them or save , to save me as a volunteer , but i found that nobody did something .
we opened the first section in 2009 .
robert : a park in heaven
and groups were very often called &quot; terrorists &quot; .
they need a process of the process of the core of this very complicated society with his problems .
it &apos;s about that we probably have the first time in the history of the arab world , a revolution of the ground : a more powerful .
paradox is that the last decade was so promising .
and once the ngos don &apos;t call their own , they don &apos;t just have the streets of the streets -- but they took them into the negotiations , for part , because they &apos;re the victims of these weapons .
thank you very much for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think &quot; the &quot; the &quot; a good thing . &quot;
so this was completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little crazy to work on a new computer company .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this strange rich man in the movie ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the last day comes out the sun , the sun coming out , they come directly to the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i &apos;m going to give you a little nervous here because i &apos;m going to tell you a few radical things about how we should think differently about cancer , which is a lot of people who have a lot more than i do .
the part of the genome we can read is the list of the ingredients .
it turns out a huge amount of information in genetics by just comparing the genetic resemblance .
and i , &quot; okay . at least this guy is good connected . &quot;
so we basically measure each other as a own one .
if you have malaria , we give them a little bit of them , or some of them .
where do we really have to get to the process , which is just the process , and that &apos;s on the level of the world &apos;s activity of why the body doesn &apos;t cure itself , how it usually makes it ? &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &quot;
danny hillis : the cancer of proteomics
they all are members in tribes .
it doesn &apos;t enough , these people just give up .
because on stage three , most of us are .
this is their lobby .
there was no plan . never before anybody tried something .
in fact , martin luther kings was a sentence in stage three .
so i &apos;m sitting here in this chair , and i don &apos;t do anything . &quot;
and suddenly they got the most popular out and tried to figure out , &quot; how do we ask the population of sub-saharan africa ? &quot;
automatically , we &apos;re going to get the little piece of plastic up .
and this is the way that we were designed to be designed to just get so much to get the taxes to the ground , to the cell that they are , they were not as permanent buildings .
they &apos;re going to be the stability and security that can offer the lap of an uncle , you compare them to the immediate construction of a computer bag in high school .
but from my perspective , compassion has a problem .
and it &apos;s the kind of a form of the kind of kind of a delight .
i can &apos;t really explain it , and it doesn &apos;t .
stories like this , signs like this , are practical aid in a world that &apos;s going to be able to get compassion , the duty of the suffering , which could otherwise be the duty of suffering .
gandhi was also a really powerful person .
and the first day , our favorite day was going to go to us and taught us our motto that we had to give every day for the rest of the summer to make the reduction .
this is one of two or three of their known ones .
here are some examples .
it turns out we can &apos;t be part of a group without a little bit of the other thing .
so that &apos;s the world that we live in today .
so i &apos;m trying to learn from my grandfather &apos;s kind of mine .
okay , number two : go into the wild .
and imagine that , you make a internal picture : i was born in a very small village in mexico , unfortunately , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very much school .
and so we think that through all the changes that are happening , we &apos;re going to face incredible opportunities .
it &apos;s a initiative that &apos;s on simple , and it &apos;s looking at the solutions , and the solutions is .
we &apos;ve now sent 30 different technologists in 18 different countries , and we were able to connect millions of people to connect , in the trial , to learn what this particular segment needs and demand .
and my father came to me and said , &quot; you know , i remember you , i remember that every generation has to make it better than the previous .
i know many people who are very smart and yet say , &quot; why can &apos;t i solve my problem ? &quot;
i started with a different family with another family .
don &apos;t you believe that we have responsibility to take the environment seriously ? &quot;
i still drive the same four years old , as well as .
but this is not a good life .
this is what he &apos;s praying .
whether you believe it or not , it doesn &apos;t make a difference for me now .
so he said , &quot; what do you think in your hand ? &quot;
what &apos;s this in your hand ? &quot; i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball , and that basketball represents your identity , which you are .
when my children were small , i was always in her room , sat on her room , and i looked at my children at sleep .
it &apos;s less than i had -- i was going to be able to be with three to 10 million -- but yet it &apos;s a very significant number .
and then in a village , we have 100 laptops , every one with a different collection of 100 books , so that the village suddenly has 10 books .
right , the famous chinese characters for the world &apos;s favorite .
you answer the question : how does it feel , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
we &apos;re really learning that really bad lesson .
think about a moment of how it is , in the right .
and unlike all other animals , we &apos;re obsessed with trying to figure out it .
and i have to tell you that i thought i was writing this incredibly ironic book about a subject that all of you hate to be a audience that would never give you .
the effect of it is not just the kind of wheat of wheat , but mountains of grain .
1986 , she came from vietnam to america .
the answer was , &quot; that &apos;s even worse . &quot;
our main system sank on a third of the average in our industry , and in the five years of the crash , our own was tripled .
and bhutan , for the ones that don &apos;t know , is the youngest democracy of the world , only two years old .
it &apos;s actually that we &apos;re often fighting the west , when happiness is something that we need to capture , a thing that we need to get , or maybe several things that we need to get .
and we &apos;re asking 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s the simplicity .
what we need to learn as leaders is that we can influence the production of production by creating the right conditions that our employees can live their appeal .
bl : okay . one , two , three .
under the deck of the inner , you &apos;re moving the inner , you move . but the eyes are moving in equilibrium with the boat , and say , &quot; i &apos;m silent . &quot;
amy , come on to the top ?
the method : what did you do ? the result : what have you seen ?
i just read one .
real scientific education should give people a voice and they &apos;re allowed to express this , and that &apos;s why amy is the last word in this short story .
poor people have not have this opportunity .
we were thrown down in the &apos; 70s .
and to come up there , we have to recognize that the principle of a computer system doesn &apos;t just hurt the species that we &apos;ve talked about , but also our society is going to be able to be able to get .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure someone &apos;s already asked , &quot; yes , great things up there -- but how do i get up there ?
i was professor at the most popular davis system and got a lot of attention to this . that allowed me to fund the launch of the program .
we have eight motors in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart , they fall up and they end up here .
i mean , people ask themselves whether mobile phones are safe .
you have a way .
because , remember the original idea of dr. , the most important mobile phone of his wife .
and for those who can &apos;t read it : it &apos;s like , &quot; it seems like it &apos;s actually a kind of wireless technology . &quot;
green or natural , natural , which is not going to be a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the benefits of the brain in our bodies .
first , a computer company , a , connected to the world &apos;s death , which is &quot; the &quot; death death &quot; .
and i was just found months later , who he was really .
i search for a cure .
i say , &quot; hold it on life if you can . &quot;
even with this kind of paper , we have the hope to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
but a feature .
suddenly he knows that he was beaten .
to allow you to allow them to put them back on the driver &apos;s seat .
we &apos;re going to be the area , we &apos;re going to get people in , we sent people into , we &apos;re going to be able to get the buildings from inside , the most important thing , and we helped the first one .
if i do this , i don &apos;t lose the original details . in the opposite , i could write history here .
you will be in the public opinion .
that &apos;s not particularly good .
and what &apos;s a democracy that is a democracy .
here &apos;s the question : what country is better , china or india ?
because the indian man has a advantage of two years to the indian woman .
what political change is , they introduced them to the world .
china , i think , has always been a few amazing , more powerful foundations -- especially in terms of social capital , public health , a sense of equality that is not there .
it was a place where people with the humanities of the world and with various types of things and the different of them .
and now they have the problem that they spent the whole money to afford help with this advanced electronics in these countries and now all of them are useful .
a bit messy environment where probably many ideas came , where people were more new , interesting , interesting , more interesting , people have been -- people different of the other things .
about one or two decades ago , a wonderful thing was a wonderful , wonderful one , and he read darwin &apos;s notebook , and he read darwin notebook from this period .
they &apos;re going to be in their colleagues , but everybody said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be .
does the other thing that goes ?
in the 1970s , this is a percent of the national income in the united states .
many of these political factors can be in the category of capitalism , &quot; capitalism , &quot; political , which is a group of good people who help a group of good people , but actually not good for the rest of us .
as you can see right , how globalization and technological revolution is creating this global rule of money , it &apos;s much harder to grade all the time .
so they &apos;re investing with the same amount of time and tools to train their children .
we created the modern health system .
this is his little hand .
and we &apos;re all going to die in one of them .
this was a huge disappointment for us , because we believed a new development .
i even think that in places like oregon , where you take medical care , and you can eat a toxic dose of food , just half a percent of people ever did .
so long , a long time , you know , they came to canada .
but i also heard about cancer as most of the time of our time , how do the good and bad together ?
some articles even went to say that muscle muscle is resistant to cancer , and beyond , not only cancer , but it &apos;s not just about cancer , but that metastases are spread in skeletal muscle .
16 percent ! that &apos;s that there were these kinds of tumors in skeletal muscle , but only 16 percent of the actual metastases -- what &apos;s going to be able to control that muscle is able to control the angiogenesis , which is the angiogenesis to control the tumors that are going to be able to control the blood vessels .
this is a very far idea of the idea , but i really think that &apos;s possible .
after that , my translator left me .
she was the girl who was in the breaks to the other for her team .
and i wrote a letter on my best friends in atlanta , georgia , who had a 11 year-old son .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot;
so the two came to lunch , and we were thrown out of the restaurant .
he had children from the whole korea in life , and he found families for them .
they have a lot of time about the dictionary .
so i open this window , look out , look out , and see how fire of the world &apos;s site is going to shoot the height . the hotel burns .
so we ran into the bathroom , took out and thought of our faces and the children .
until the adoption of the adoption . a year ! what does this need so long ?
this is their favorite .
this is sydney , which is a few days old .
but there was no evidence .
there are little planets , there are bigger planets , there are big planets , okay .
but there &apos;s a lot more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something that depends on the planet ?
and this deeper thing , underlying dot is that science is that science is , the life , how we know it , to define .
okay , let &apos;s say , this is the size of the world &apos;s size , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , okay , from here .
thank you very much .
look at : while uganda goes down and zimbabwe , russia went on a percent .
they find the highest hiv in the world in african countries , and yet they find in senegal , here , the same rate , the same rate as in the united states .
look at kenya .
it could be that it &apos;s something else that &apos;s more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be more likely .
we know about the world &apos;s billion billion people ever lived .
that wasn &apos;t just a economic story .
and the result is even a bigger divergence in a shorter period of time than it was in germany .
it &apos;s just with institutions .
you just have to give me food . &quot;
he was wrong .
well , i want to end with three questions , and i &apos;m going to end with the future billion , shortly before the united states , when the united states is losing the number of economy .
no , we &apos;re going to be able to get a lot of the giant , regardless of the giant , which we have , regardless of the signs that we lost our work work and other parts of our historical .
niall , thank you .
there are many kinds of spider spider .
spider silk is almost completely completely made of protein .
the fibers that can make a single spider , are pretty diverse .

what i want to pay is not the mermaid , so lovely it may be , but on the photos .

that sounds alien in our ears , but what happens is that 80 percent of the tncs have contributed much .
the first thing happens when you &apos;re a problem , that the first goal of institution immediately changes from what the goal is to be changing .
the inventor don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states , trying to figure out whether bloggers are journalists or not .
she was created by making their own , the use of many of these tools , analyzed the energy of the world today , and no one &apos;s the same work for the attacks in the last week .
you have a lot of the time that &apos;s probably for us , and you &apos;re probably the fibers that &apos;s going to be the of the bread or the fibers , because it &apos;s just full of fibers , because it &apos;s made out of fibers .
everything is on his place . first of all , the level .
we call it &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but let &apos;s look at the different steps , under the point of the possible connections , to a deeper level -- my search is to be a very profound thing to the question , &quot; what is so special about bread ? &quot;
this is transformation , two different things .
and if you &apos;re shaped , you go back to prove that you &apos;re alive and character .
if you do this bread , you can use any kind of a new test of every beer .
it will be a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a bit of a time , as we work through this talk .
it takes very , very long , and to write , and work on a piece , i &apos;m working on a piece that is 180 pages long , and that &apos;s a big part of my life and i &apos;m going to get the hair .
it &apos;s shown by brian &apos;s , which is an extraordinary artist .
you have a little taste of the piece .
what we did -- sh , one of my students , and i -- we gave the babies two dishes to eat : a bowl with a little bit of a dish with a little bit of broccoli , and a bowl with a video of the street .
i mean , last eventually , if we look at babies , they seem pretty useless .
and our babies and children are much longer dependent on us than the babies every other species .
the most important thing is to make it , to change the hypothesis .
now there are two things that really interesting is really interesting .
boy : so .
our consciousness about this thing is extremely bright and vivid , and everything else will be like dark .
&quot; babies and little children are like the research and the human species , &quot; the psychologist of the human species , &quot; the psychologist is looking at the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the baby , &quot; as babies are going to capture information , and decisions .
if i could borrow you for a little demonstration of the difference to show the difference -- because it &apos;s actually quite quite hurt .
and then you repeat this process , and again , until something that comes out of the way -- in this case , the character is supposed to be like me , just walking out .
what we really wanted was the whole human body .
so , you can &apos;t do that .
here &apos;s a few simple scenes , like he was going to be .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we &apos;ve done it yet .
some studio already use our software to do exactly the same , and we &apos;re going to be a few of our most important things in a few big types of information .
we thought he was just holding the balance .
here you learn to go to the most important -- how most of you hopefully know .
but i have to say , i &apos;ll never forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i &apos;m convinced art and creativity is very essential to develop empathy .
if you &apos;re ever the lonely , you write a new york times column , then you get hundreds of emails . most of what i &apos;m going to do today , reported by frustration .
some stories are just classic , but yet , it &apos;s so much so comfortable .
it &apos;s going to be . nobody bought it .
there &apos;s a border that we don &apos;t want to cross . what is the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want to make a new , empty document in word -- that could be .
but i think there &apos;s actually two microsoft microsoft .
the other products were supported by microsoft with a open standard , rather than apple &apos;s standard .
and the most important thing , if somebody writes a little bit of a time -- what happens every day -- i say , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to say . &quot;
but when i looked at the most violent technologies , nanotechnology , and other people in the process of digital technologies , i made a very big concern about the most important thing .
and to cover the danger of this new things , we have to ultimately have the ability to be able to get the individuals to the most common , which is basically the access to the access to the access to the access .
i think the challenge we are -- i &apos;m very sure that this is going to happen -- the challenge is , is we going to develop these kinds of things that are going to be able to use from this device ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , for example , you have all kinds of incredible properties .
and to give you a sense of the last of small commercial fund -- he &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a million dollars , which is right for us to be quite remarkable .
and if you &apos;re doing the concept of insurance insurance , you can do a lot of the time , you can use a lot of the time -- to provide feedback .
12 years ago caves started to be fascinated by the , and i &apos;m going to be my research in this direction .
so wonderful and grim things .
there &apos;s ice below the surface .
so they &apos;re a kind of a life form .
it &apos;s even so much energy for biology in this cave that there &apos;s actually a big number of water .
we can see them .
we realized a few years ago that caves have many properties that have been used by people and other organisms as habitat .
whenever you get a goal , to your own , you have to be able to get a sense of your own steps , certain struggle to be taken .
and so it &apos;s also in archimedes , the big greek mathematician .
beatrice was painted and it was suffering under extreme the most powerful .
that means before we could start to digitize the most powerful , we had to take the book apart .

but by flying around the electrons , they &apos;re going to be arrogant .

that really interesting about usc is that you can measure them .
well , i could develop a game with the name of the name , by having to get a million pies , or a thousand pies .

so , i think it &apos;s got the minimal food that we can probably do to make things .
and we decided we should not think about this very much in terms of the cost , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book that means , &quot; what &apos;s the most important thing to the north of kansas ? &quot;
so we have to ask why .

and my experience with islamic world is very different .
there are the character for example , and there &apos;s a figure out .
and why does sex lead to babies , and why does babies mean a erotic disaster ?

in this case , you take a little bit of a little bit of a sudden , and you put it on a pile of the way that the different characters in a game or a story , in that case , the big fish .
if you learn to code , you can code to learn .
if kids like the life-saving such projects , they learn important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s just the beginning .

unlike the low entropy of the early universe , although we don &apos;t know the answer to this , we have a good theory that can explain that , if this theory is true , and that the theory of the dark energy .
and therefore , it &apos;s going to be , although the universe is going to continue and ordinary matter and radiation , always , a certain measure of radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even in empty space .
but we also give it big fluctuations .
it &apos;s arrogant .
it &apos;s a yemeni fact of the universe that you accept and not question .

ue : no . this is just smoke .
occasionally i meet scientists .
so i had hope that , by having some natural elements , a little bit of fog , i could make the space tangible .
the horror is that it makes a difference whether you do something or not .

how do we create a notion that is both of the caring of hungry , and also to be a hurry , without the two different directions ?

it &apos;s just a little cylinder down here , which is the generator and all the most powerful in the way that we have , and this is the hot cylinder , the hot cylinder , the hot cylinder , and it &apos;s going to come out of electricity .
you don &apos;t have to use the hot water , it can also cool .

in these two examples , we &apos;ve seen machines that have learned in the simulation , and others who have learned it in reality .

and i think even our leaders would say in this case , that we have a lot of doing a lot of things .
i &apos;m very pleased to answer your questions .
our centers for the world &apos;s own have a test of them , and as a rapid , a rapid thing .
and in the way , in people , similar bacterial infections were not a problem .

so i started about 15 years ago .
the breath is the air in the world &apos;s office , and the air comes from the top of the world .
everybody &apos;s computer can do the entire system , so if two of them are going to get to the , there &apos;s reserves .
but this is what it looks like , and this habitat is always going to continue to go over many miles .
so sharks are not quite dangerous as most people are going to represent them .
when we found it , we didn &apos;t even have sure what family he heard , so we called him the &#91; &#93; , and we looked at it , because he looked like he looked like he was going to come from one of his books .
the oxygen oxygen has a more sophisticated and he &apos;s officially .
this means that every one and each of you here are at least a child that &apos;s suffering in a disorder .
and his communication and social interaction improved so much that he could visit a normal school and even a more powerful one .
it &apos;s like life : if you &apos;re just in there , you can &apos;t get out of it .
i know you never heard about him , but you &apos;ll notice this day , one day you &apos;ll hear about him , because it &apos;s an amazing man . &quot;
nk : no , he died 25 years ago .
he had a lot of love , he loved every one .
we , all of us , are what happens when a soup of hydrogen and helium so long , they start asking their origins to ask their origins .
these are the most important evidence that life can exist in many other environments .
so you have to learn the diversity and the incredible scale of life on this planet in the first step , to be deeply deeply in the world , to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get into a touch with life elsewhere in all of the time .
so , in this , silicon times as important as aluminum , and we &apos;re going to expand the future , by expanding it on 350 antennae , so it &apos;s sensitive and to the moore &apos;s law of the universe .
and then we &apos;d like to look for the most important search of human being .
many say it &apos;s the best place of the world to study the development of climate change .
every cylinder is a very reactive one of the time .
while you &apos;re with the ice , warm you have a more few gloves in a oven , so you can put a new pair of gloves if your own , and your fingers are being stiff .
i think that &apos;s a little bit of a bit of economic growth .
and our soldiers don &apos;t just have to be able to get to the pipelines in the blink of the kitchen , and they &apos;re actually reported to the service to get american , to the american , to get american .
you can keep it further , and the efficiency almost the tides with some of the things that double the world &apos;s disease and the world &apos;s population of the big world &apos;s population .
we could build bigger cars , which would be to be able to do , but easily should be .
but instead , they sell it to china and japan , because we have to protect our own health system and not .
and that &apos;s the most important thing to do the step of mass production of these kinds of materials , or in this case , to make the manufacturing of the world , as good as a good , good , as good as it has been going to get the internet to the internet .
it can &apos;t just act about a giant conspiracy .
there were two types of negative feedback that we have .
we hope that it really goes to it .
oops , i &apos;m wrong .
and at the end , he found a very , very , dutch , a dutch called han van meegeren , who sold him a wonderful vermeer to a prize that &apos;s about 10 million dollars .
according to his favorite , he saw , when he had discovered the first time he discovered that there &apos;s bad in the world . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s coming on . what is it ? &quot; is a good answer .
but as attractive they find them , how much they &apos;re making them sexually or romantic , depends on what they think they &apos;re looking at .
but every one of these three objects has a value beyond what it brings , because of his story .
but i don &apos;t want to copy a copy , even though i can &apos;t see the difference .
so he brought joshua bell to take his favorite in washington d.c. in washington d.c. , to put on a corner and see how much money he will take .
the second shock is painful , because you &apos;re going to be a little bit of it .
and if you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a political , you can see that maybe a kind of political brain is going to be .
they &apos;re going to be a organic , professional member of the american , which is very glamorous , which sounds very glamorous and exciting .
and what you find is of course , that people who eat vegetables and oil , less , less , less sophisticated .
the most intriguing thing is one of the most intriguing things in the world of medicine .
it &apos;s a very popular conclusion when you give a drug in such a high dose that it will have more side effects , and that you &apos;re going to look better .
the big attempt are closer to the real answer .
this is a problem that &apos;s not a solution to that right now .
and very soon , they had begun to get these coal , ton of new zealand to stack , and they &apos;re going to be a ton of times , and they &apos;re going to go back to china , and they all over the world .
can you imagine how you would feel , if you were on my place ?
it &apos;s just about oil ; you know that , all knowledge .
there &apos;s this thing that &apos;s the world &apos;s most important , and that &apos;s right from the middle of the united states .
and what do you see ? they &apos;re christians .
man , the americans , are kind of like , &quot; ah , &quot; ah .
these christians are the most powerful .
they &apos;re going to be . this is wrong .
and the soldiers are chinese , and all other people are chinese .
you can imagine that maybe one of them is going down to his child , and it &apos;s called , &quot; honey , i &apos;m back after . &quot;
everything has changed .
and all of this has tremendous implications on the world .
i think thomas jefferson has really been very good in words .
for the most important in the audience , it &apos;s actually going to explain why a bigger budget has a greater budget than comedy , that &apos;s the way that we &apos;re going to translate the way that we &apos;re going to translate the same thing in other languages and cultures . so the market for these films are bigger .
but it &apos;s going to happen within this century .
this is not the most important of the united states , which is about a million , but gdp of the world per capita -- 200,000 dollars .
and also , as everyone knows here -- it &apos;s about energy , not oil .
my choice is the peak of a lifetime of a lifetime that started growing on the gulf of the gulf of the gulf of the gulf .
a lot of our actions on this planet , which are in our living environment , are only by faith and guess .
one has been a thousand or millions of years .

real falcon from lightly chickens .
there &apos;s a program that &apos;s just brilliant to the most brilliant .
this is an emotional topic . some people are up .
my grandmother was a very recent .
i also made my own comics , which was another way to tell stories , through words and images .
and we sat in the short , in silence , and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really talented . &quot;
use your own style . draw not how to tell you .
&quot; rather &quot; , i have your own , you get your own .

so the mystery is , why is it , good requests , and the threats of the threats , and threats so often ?
you can try to imagine what &apos;s going to be if language could only be used literally .
and the other puzzle is that i don &apos;t have a problem with it .
here &apos;s my argument . is it sustainable ? is it good ?
it makes it a lot of time . it &apos;s a lot of time .
what do you have to do from it , to convince me ?
all these different roles . can you imagine a argument where you &apos;re going to participate , but in the audience , and look at the debate ?
or -- and that &apos;s the most important part of me : we want you to be able to get us into the world of nature . we bring a design and find the master &apos;s master &apos;s dependence on nature .
this changed everything . from there , these engineers were not in the boat .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here &apos;s how we make things .
this is the national national lab .

what you don &apos;t see , you can &apos;t count .
my first business was a computer company . i started under the taliban .
in south korea , and indonesia are almost half a million companies .

people are going to be the people who are the excitement and this miracle .
i have a big bang of happy , and i &apos;m going to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little
first of all , we &apos;ve got it .
what does this mean ?
when i started to deal with them , i found that they were incredibly good .
but the researchers had a problem .
until finally , their degree made and left the campus -- and certainly , they were going to come up , and they were going to come back , and they found that crows still have been remembered .
we found that they &apos;re really smart and they can teach each other to do things .
squirrel for example , for example , would come to the peanut and go back .
but there were three problems that i couldn &apos;t solve , and i &apos;d like to talk about it , but i want to talk about it , but more importantly , i found a kind of a computer .
who would ever hire me ? &quot;
and imagine what could happen , because every region has a little bit of a region .
let me make the connection .
you know that there &apos;s the future of the future . you have to understand that .
this is a lot to animate .

so , you have an evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i have to read you what she said , because i find it so beautiful .
i think that &apos;s very unfortunate . not because i &apos;d want to use it . i wanted to see him .
and that &apos;s actually the beginning of our story .
now i would have thought to this moment that age of 50 , one of the skills i really had , was my shoes to crack .
first i have to tell you that i &apos;m not here .
yes . the artist doesn &apos;t seem to know where it &apos;s supposed to be the different colors .
but i can see in your faces that you &apos;re still a little skeptical .

after a while , i decided to have something fun , and before i left the room in the morning , i went to a few things in the room .

my father was one , so my youth was interesting .
the song as a mere fact .
i &apos;m , &quot; well , is it good , i &apos;m going to put the wheels . &quot; from pure protest , i bought the scarf wheels , and i built it , and i &apos;m looking at it , and look at it .

and then i started to ask how many times before , like my life would have been different when this man wouldn &apos;t have hurt me if my genes have a different portion of experience .
i was , but i was now a kind of a more , i was myself , and i suspect i was going to myself , i was going to myself .
i was hoping to be a lot of simpler , and i was hoping to trade this turkish , and i was going to do this , to make me go back to my way .
he spent six months in prison , lost his favorite for a decade .

we &apos;re working with the machine in the university of california in california , san diego together .
first , the perception of people . and second , a natural interface , a natural form of control , so that interaction is going to be intuitive with the robot for you .

after i realized this economic danger , i thought we need to find a solution for this problem .
some of you have actually been in the speaker , like nathan &apos;s way to talk to nathan , or the one of tim drake who may be considered as a hard thing .
i don &apos;t know a tedtalk that includes that .
and i paid 25 cents , because i found the task , the task was something harder .
and yet , there was one , which was all safe , the expansion had to slow down .
keep the mystery of the dark energy in the back , because i &apos;m going to call you three of the things that i &apos;m going to call you three main theory .
the list of the list went on about 10 .
and he worked on this number of things , and he had no success , and we didn &apos;t know why .
each of these universes has extra dimensions .
because the astronomers of today , by turning powerful telescopes to heaven , discover a handful of photons -- a kind of cosmic , billions of cosmic , billions of years .
well , i want to be honest with you and tell you that most of it is just one trick , but a trick that actually works .
think about it , it &apos;s the first time you meet it . we want to really make them more curious and more curious .
he said , &quot; go , milo . &quot;
pm : this is dimitri so right in the field of time .
we don &apos;t know here .
the next moment , the phone doesn &apos;t work anymore , the tv goes out , the experimenter are on the street , there are a lot of the road .
it was a very grim meeting of reporters who had worked in war , who had employees of ngos , and of course the bold , brave people from sarajevo itself .
if i &apos;m going to ask , why i &apos;m going to keep a lot of time , why i &apos;m going to stay on that , that &apos;s the reason .
but it &apos;s my profession to break up and this is the most powerful , the core of the thing , for reporters .
even before a goal is , it &apos;s trying to find the joystick of the carrot , and the goal of finding the goal is to find the goal , no matter where it is .
basically , we trained the animals to control these , and to explore these kinds of things , and to explore objects in the virtual world .
in a experiment we did a few years ago , we went to the limit .
so we start in china .
so , aria manju did the most popular .
please raise your hand .
the last reason to do that is that women are part of the solution , not the problem .
in the niger , in the slice of seven women in the birth of a child .
she was part of the solution , not the problem .
larry : when he was given as a computer bank , once he said , &quot; it can be good that investment in education is the highest of girls in the developing world . &quot;
this is bill &apos;s book .
and that was the feather of a bird .
this whole whole whole the whole of our own world &apos;s one is telling us that there &apos;s a computer company .
and even this picture makes the suspects sense of being a little bit of the way that the kind of the computer &amp; amp ; it &apos;s a little bit of the kind of a computer &amp; amp ; it &apos;s a little bit of the time .
one of these possibilities was that we could have been able to get into small ways .
they put their brainwaves and say , &quot; i want to share this sticky , &quot; i want to share this sticky arrows . we share 50 to 50 . &quot;
there are places on this island where they can make all three or four miles on a new language .
if 27 individuals came from these 27 member member of the book , their 23 languages , they &apos;re just telling them a very simple one , and they &apos;ll just tell you a army of the way that they &apos;re going to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared to
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that they were also about language .
and what i &apos;m interested in most of the time is the invisible space between a text and the most profound picture , and how the image is changing through the text , and the text through the picture .
this is the most powerful , which is going to run over the atlantic ocean , and north america with europe .
they turn the negative to .
but through the impression of the idea of the way , the way that we can change the world &apos;s , and the world &apos;s life , the most important thing .
larry , eight years of a 10 years of a year , was a half of a year , arizona , for kidnapping and repeated a young boy on a computer company .
before the people are leaving themselves .
and they &apos;ve brought them to texas for us here .
and now you drive with the food , where you &apos;re in this moment .
it &apos;s just the vast space that makes it look like nothing .
so something called a excuse to be a sense : the pursuit of happiness and human design .
part is the legacy of the northwest , the joint , the pursuit of happiness for happiness , it &apos;s driven by the individual aspects of the individual , and it can &apos;t be found in reality .
a computer of happiness is that happiness and bad no longer in a closed continuum is in a closed continuum .
it starts in the most violent .
here &apos;s a three weeks old baby .
in the animal kingdom , there &apos;s only one way to increase the status that is dominance .
i want to close with some quotes .
why should you choose rats ?
once the rat understood that , we have a little bit more difficult to do .
you can actually heal t.b. , even in humans , the hiv .
with the knowledge that a patient , the microscopic puppet remains , until 15 people infected -- 15 healthy people -- a year , you can be safe , we &apos;ve been saved with a lot of life .
here we see neurons .
so this is important for imitation and the humanities .
now , the question is : if i just watch how a other person is touching why i &apos;m not confused and literally that kind of a little bit of the naked , how somebody is touching ?
thank you . i &apos;ve got two of the two artists here today .
i &apos;m not really going to be the most important , but to the pollen itself .
all these images were taken by a timeline in the lab of kew .
even every single one of us has a story to tell the most important story .
we need to be so good as the breast cancer , to address this crisis .
and at the time , in the 1980s , when we &apos;ve been able to go through women and death through heart disease , she wrote a single one for the new england journal of medicine and called the syndrome .
our colleagues in washington , d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike the most important , x-ray , the women , for women whose native the view of the heart , every time we organize something that is also a little bit of radiation , we &apos;re asking , &quot; is this test really necessary ? &quot;
okay , here we started .
they &apos;ve done what they said , they &apos;ve been given them to the most powerful and they were breeding .
the cells have something like this , and they don &apos;t feel like the dish .
what does that mean for us ?
in the course of three years , we took eight to 10 hours , collected about a quarter of a quarter of a quarter of a quarter of a quarter of a quarter of a million hours of a million hours of a million hours of a million .
this is one of the first most popular , which came out of something more than a year ago .
and finally , my son is going to be alone in a walker .
three of the most important people in this project philip , the humanities , and the most important , and the most important roy is to see .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamic in the game .
this is the first time that our son made more than two steps once -- captured in the movie .
and that &apos;s a important question to the question , because the better we understand how the brain creates meaning , the better we can communicate . i think , the better we can think of it and work .
it &apos;s a kind of center where you see a picture and think &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional response to the point . &quot;
what we literally do is to paint our team in the entire wall of the whole wall .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just about acromegaly , but also to the possibility of relaxation .
so there &apos;s not a lot of it .
if you translated that into the building industry , if you have a computer , and you &apos;re broken a window , then we say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken , that &apos;s broken .
this is the difference .
so we kept on the way .
are we just stupid ?
you might be able to get it into two years , if you read eight hours a day .
so , in september , you can say , &quot; i &apos;m important today .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
and the police waiting to come up with the fire fire to cut the vehicle into pieces to get the body of the driver &apos;s body .
and that &apos;s enough to the present with the most popular in the united states , which is a eye of the divine intervention .
all of that leads us to -- the only thing that we do is to name that , which is what we do most of the digital devices .
this is the consequence of destruction of more than a third of the brain on the right side of the stroke .
this is a very , very low level to get out of the health care system .
he gave my jaw in the right position while he was going to be my teeth .
alfred man is a brilliant physicist and self-deception , who &apos;s fascinated by the gaps of consciousness , whether he &apos;s a deaf , or a blind that &apos;s a blind , or a blind the movement .
now i had to go into the dark years , which followed , what was going to me when everything that was particularly made of this , disappeared .
and it works . it works .
lp : so if you have the opportunity , you spend time with simon .
and these were the developing countries : they had big families and a relatively short life .
and these are on this side . a big volcanic of africa and the world &apos;s .
and then deng xiaoping came and brought money to china and brought the country back to a middle .
a search that we can copy the data in a form of a format , and we can publish the world , and what do we hear when we look around ?
but this is made hypotheses .
you know , darwin has explained the life after it was made , what was the essence of life ?
and i learned francis crick .
but there was what in the literature .
we were not the best chemist in the room .
i was unhappy ; my girl was married me .
you can compare dna to the normal of the other , and you can compare the sensitivity of the other .
and so i &apos;ll close , by telling you that we &apos;ve looked at 20 people with schizophrenia .
average , the defense of a single one is two million dollars , and it takes 18 months if you win .
first , they don &apos;t fight the patent for the patent but against the most important .
my solution : give me this patent and i &apos;ll leave you with a little bit of a little bit of a mess .
&quot; why not ? &quot;
the fathers were on a place where they &apos;re moving their daughters to play their chairs , and they could reach their hand to dance .
this is a great technology .
it &apos;s not very much left on the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in people .
can the enemy not see the most time , and we needed a different approach to eradicate polio as we did with smallpox .
it helped control pandemic , to control tokyo for example .
the reality of polio today is something different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : now bruce , where are the most difficult places ?
bruce : how we &apos;re going to get polio to a standstill .
dj : we found this kind of thing now at all kinds of animals , especially in the cats .
and to our surprise , it became a more powerful .
for us , this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration , a symbol of this hope , which is accompanied us at our work .
it was incredible as she took it in security to protect it before the hyena .
and of course , if i look at these kinds of things that became the most powerful , she reminds me about a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic because your fate is in our hand .
we need it . we respect and celebrate each other as a man and woman as a community and a part of this planet and we have to continue to go on .
and it seems obvious to be that the earth is big and six , the sun , the sun , and it &apos;s worth , and it &apos;s worth what &apos;s going on to be a bit of the time , and it &apos;s worth what &apos;s going on .
and that &apos;s that in middle world , in the middle world , there &apos;s always .
nature is dependent on what kind of animal we are .
because there are so many of them , and because between them , there are no consensus in their favorite , and they &apos;re going to be able to see the most important thing to see in middle middle world , and we &apos;re looking at it .
people as machines like to treat scientific and they &apos;re going to be accurate , but it &apos;s a more powerful waste of time when you want to guess what the person will do next .
and i was in the wheels , i was in the wheels age of 40 years .
over a cursor i control with my head , allow me to see these kinds of things , video of the robot , and send orders to send the buttons in a computer system .
with people like you can do this dream , we can make this dream .
in the airstream , for example , a very reactive lexicon is developed by the most powerful , which is basically the most important , which is the dolphins who are sending the dolphins , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
i think we can make a global community .
this is a hot kind of a hot thing .
now there are some -- there are some lessons that you can learn from it .
but normally we don &apos;t normally do this .
i think we tend to look at this : the infrastructure of globalization .
so this is down to 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem that we need to solve .
i also take that most of you don &apos;t speak chinese -- what really sad is if you think that this is the most common language in the internet .
what look at ? maybe we should do that .
if you look at this picture , you might think , &quot; why should i care about it ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find its place in it .
they would bring wealth and security , religious violence and make sure that states never back terrorists .
and part of this activity is honesty .
what is this ?
i love this dish .
and the war was introduced to the 20 million people , and the life of the civil war was going to be the world &apos;s life .
so , in fact , the yo-yo , who is this guy : &quot; i would have made all of this money , but i spent all these time to look at the american man who had stolen my recipe .
chinese restaurants have done largely the same , i would argue , with the beaver and the twin -- even the restaurant -- but without a centralized headquarters .
in contrast , we have general tso chicken , which is actually in new york city in the early 1970s , when i was just in the university of the university in new york city , so ...
so what we see in the 17th , 18th century , is the most powerful search for medicine , which creates the same thing .
so people would have a really big twist .
when the necessary ones started to become less , i was clear , and i was clear to my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
do you remember , when a child goes to every line ?
18 and 19 , i slept the night through .
again , i &apos;ll be a little depressed and something more scary .
so , many of us is clear that there are a lot to do in the next few years .
he goes around : &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know , where did the world work in the treatment of the known problems that made out of the potential of earthquake and climate change ?
if you &apos;re the impossible of the impossible , you can do it .
but we &apos;ve reached a agreement for climate change .
and there &apos;s god .
the most remarkable power is something remarkable : it uses two ingredients , proteins and water that are in their perceptual , to create a material that is extraordinary than protection , comparable fibers like uruguay .
or you &apos;re going to be beautiful things like this , if the camera can capture this .
here you see how it &apos;s taken from the tissue .
with my new project , i &apos;d like to use art to create art for this , technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that &apos;s going to be the way that the applause and the round of the applause and the round of the air -- hopefully not -- to help him to make some of his next decisions .
what &apos;s going to do i &apos;m going to do ? &quot;
in the frame of this still , the unprecedented demonstration of the data is never a unprecedented knight , a computer , which can be far more than a computer , which is a lot more than a computer , and it &apos;s going to be the feedback of the amount of the amount of time . works this thing ?
stanley , inventor of the known , the known thing to be the known of the world &apos;s known , was in the most violent and the most powerful , that it &apos;s a connection between two to seven steps .
how does our view change about relationships ?
there was a exchange that i &apos;m going to tell you , and where he might have been able to put this one in the ear .
um ... my father , a computer company ?
it was his father who decided that she needed wrong papers .
this feeling of responsibility has been about life of other people , and he was in the other age of 17 years , and also his fault , to be a computer , because he was out of a camp , he kept his whole life long .
and while my favorite and my favorite thought had to give up , kind of orphans , my father &apos;s father , my father &apos;s false papers .
i asked him , the victims of victims he had taken if he ever had the most powerful .
we grow from a few million people to seven billion people that we are today .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a little bit of a computer system on the surface of the level , which is a very , very , very , very , very , very , very in a good state .
if you &apos;re going to get the forests , the border in the land , you &apos;re going to be able to stay the ability to stay , stable .
with the realization of the , fishermen , the most great barrier reef , and scientists that are the great barrier reef , under the current , the current barrier reef .
but the drama of course is that , obviously , that &apos;s what &apos;s clear that the change is not an option .
this leads me to another reason why i &apos;m here today : because i really like to really do it .
this is a race of a race of a race of far developed .
and it &apos;s a ancient kind of manufacturing , which is the most violent and connected to a three-dimensional perspective , which was a very new technique to this time .
and by the process of sugar on black , i asked portraits from you .
it became very large images and i took them with a very large camera , a camera camera .
my interest on the most bad , especially worse , is very far .
on the back , a sequence is also the chimps that are also in the chimps .
we can ask : is there general differences between africans and the most powerful ?
and then you can compare it to the genome today .
we can then ask ourselves to the same questions , how about neanderthals : have you to mix with ancestors of today ?
there are many people who designed their own vision of the beginning of the 20th century .
after my belief , the airplane of the future has its own consciousness .
imagine , carbon dioxide grow in 3d 3d , and they &apos;re embedded in a more powerful , and follow the forces that are in their components .
they didn &apos;t speak . but especially they were extraordinary from the world around them , from their environment and from the people .
they would be able to call them the police . they would call the police .
now we know that it &apos;s about a 100 .
you see a video .
you have the feeling that research is working with the reality that you have , really , a effect on reality , that you can actually prevent this experience with that area that i started in this area .
then you go off .
you &apos;re going to put you in a stare of body , and you chose to put a body on the top of your arms , poor , poor .
they did all this as we had taught them .
and after the battle , they bring this mobile class and make this what you call &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; to teach you what you did wrong .
people have changed .
i said , &quot; where is he now ? &quot;
this is not a piece .
and she showed up the left work to tell me how problematic this picture was , which was the idea of the idea of the idea of how black was represented .
it &apos;s really in this sense of the world &apos;s design that i have a new series of questions that i &apos;m going to do .
well , this is kind of a obvious statement .
and the kids said , &quot; how should we do that . &quot;
i think you &apos;re trying to multiply numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long do you have to do that before you decided that you didn &apos;t understand anything ? &quot;
their favorite , increased to 50 , which is different schools , and they &apos;re going to reach in the world with a computer of biotechnology .
was 76 percent . the test , two months later , was the result 76 percent .
after eight ted talks , he wanted to be there .
these are obsolete .
suddenly , i looked out of the darkness on the opposite side of the space , a kind of mirrors of mirrors that were thrown from the moon .
if i had to reduce the whole story on a picture , what would it be ?
i &apos;m going to show you some clips of my other big project in this year . &quot; the tempest &quot; -- the storm &quot; -- the storm &quot; -- the storm .
and our little lives ends in a sleep .
bono : they &apos;re parked .
i know you understand that .
so blue , blue , everything became blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both games are playing in africa .
it &apos;s another one that acts in the interface of health and business .
let &apos;s use the markets as the most powerful , which we have , and find out what price would pay for that , so that they would have the choice .
thank you .
the most important thing was , if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we destroyed two of these two , and 10 tv .
the little thing that &apos;s going to be made from his trace , and that was a problem .
this is very good . it &apos;s going to slow slowly .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of a few of the models that i work with .
tissue of the density of the density and behavior is the second part , and that &apos;s actually the key to use these models for the most important , to use these models for the world .
thank you .
and the attempt to go to the just is to shoot a arrow with the end of the end of the end of the end , and it was hard work , and young , young , i &apos;ve learned a lot of respect for nature .
now let &apos;s look at the other side .
we work on projects -- even more sophisticated developments , like the most powerful , as a little bit of the -- darpa , the california institute of technology and university .
be careful , they just behave like wood or something like that .
now i didn &apos;t try to be a lot of time .
they go forever .
these are about two billion .
it takes him to be about &quot; three years of the &quot; three years . &quot;
don &apos;t forget that one of the people who are a cutting .
but for me , this is a great thing for the time that we &apos;re living in the human mind , where we can win in the human mind and machines .
i realized a lot of mass . where do you come from ?
it &apos;s too afraid that the way in the wild is extinct in 20 to 30 years .
all evidence of that is that this cancer is being transmitted from a virus .
i took the opportunity to be true and took some samples from jonas &apos; tumor , and a few samples of other parts of the body .
she brought him to the one-eyed and this discovered something more powerful .
and finally , cancer is an inevitable consequence of the ability to share our cells and adapt to their environment .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and that &apos;s a global phenomenon .
they would be able to wait to wait for it .
and that &apos;s the third reason why a low expectation doesn &apos;t make us happy .
but they didn &apos;t think the numbers on them are the numbers .
first of all , i &apos;m going to show you the most powerful for optimism .
but the good news is that our illusion is not broken when we &apos;re aware of this kind of thing .
but what we &apos;re going to see in the 21st century is asia , the incremental back to the back , to get more than half the world &apos;s population and to get half of the global economy .
you could look at this as the privatization of the war .
after 1979 , the soviets had the sputnik , it was , &quot; that &apos;s the end of america . &quot;
if you live in japan or new delhi or you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a different way of china , or you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be a different way of living in beijing .
and if we have strategies in the bigger historical context , we can be able to do this process .
how do we define our national interests so that it doesn &apos;t just be a more powerful thing .
this is the conventional approach that &apos;s the conventional approach .
this is typically the responsibility to be able to guarantee the components of a stable security .
they &apos;re a long dependent on each other .
jobs for who ? especially for young men .
after mostly the legal system is collapsed , you can &apos;t even get access to it .
the care of the own , after the conflict , the state of the conflict , government .
this is the silhouette of my hometown new orleans .
the military has understood it . they call climate change a computer company , which is threatened by security and stability , as governments are talking to the world .
it allows you to become more productive , so you can afford insurance itself .
these are certainly inspiring examples of possible solutions when we feel able to plan for a world &apos;s world .
listen like chinese students , they &apos;re practicing it by shouting it .
teachers : perfect ! students : perfect !
and that &apos;s what things that are going to be a concrete world with the concrete world , abstractions , which we try to make logical , and we also take the hypothetical seriously , which is what could be , which is what might be , as what &apos;s going on .
luria looked at people before they were in the scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to a more concrete world .
there was luria : &quot; on the north pole , there &apos;s always snow .
they chose a marker instead of new york .
it wasn &apos;t just the spread of cognitively tough professions .
would you have managed to get killed ? &quot;
you could say , a half .
it feels like i landed in a colony of angels . &quot;
and they &apos;re going to be able to do a degree in something .
it &apos;s still in the red numbers , but chris made it with personal victims , this film .
i &apos;m one of her favorite .
there &apos;s a prime minister , a minister of secretary , foreign secretary and a banana , or president of the world &apos;s office .
boy : &quot; the most serious is serious .
we were all angry on them , &quot; why do you do that ?
this will be a lot of real , if you read it . &quot;
we &apos;ve been playing the game forever after school , about seven weeks , and we had all the 50 years of the crises of the crises .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
many people were paying good jobs and closed the most popular .
it &apos;s like his own little connection .
if i all have three legs of this , in the three peaks of the triangle , i would get a kite .
so everything you do is -- it &apos;s a very powerful case -- this old , old , and this old plastic &#91; unclear &#93; . this is a very simple thing to do in a old age .
this is possible when you have a whole piece of paper , and you can be a piece of paper , and you can be in a school school , or in a state school -- a sheet , a ruler , no a jeep , no glue , no a glue , no glue .
what we do is a very simple thing .
this is a little bit of a little bit of the way that you do , is these two corners here , it will be like a computer system .
here are two magnets .
it was very many passengers on the ship , and it was boring , so the captain invited her to his deck .
in the world &apos;s conference , it shows the defenders , and yet , amazingly plans , and yet , amazing plans to turn waste in really the way that children can build themselves , and they can learn to make the kids themselves -- while they learn basic principles of science and design .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually examples of biology that was a lot of evidence .
and there &apos;s a few examples of projects that are aware of ecosystems .
and with a little planning , we can be dominated by traffic , and we can turn a place of traffic , which is open space for people who are going to connect people to food and waste waste in opportunities .
this photograph was done at the day of the end , and just a year later , it looked like this .
if you tap water , the first thing is calcium carbonate .
no , you have to go to the people with visions of the other . &quot;
i looked at somebody who &apos;s jewish , because i &apos;m jewish and because i &apos;m very important .
but the real failure was that there was a lot of men who wanted to go to me .
very few of us have the ability to be absolutely honest with themselves .
he likes to travel as long as it &apos;s not on a computer .
i was trying to be in principle , like the way to be .
because they remember my favorite , they have to reach a little bit of 700 points and no one did it .
most of you . gamers are 33 years old , not eight years , and if we look at the demographics of the world &apos;s demographics , the gamers of tomorrow are older adults .
imagine that their vision is very , very good .
these players even have many other benefits in terms of attention , and a aspect of attention , which is also improved , is our ability to pursue objects in our environment .
i want to ask you to remember this result , and it &apos;s in the context of another group of the other group of the other group of the other group , a group that &apos;s actually seen in our society , which is the school of people who are doing the school .
let me explain this step with a task that calls mental flights .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just all kinds of programs of special if we look at that , running .
so it was a big , very complex project i didn &apos;t even have to do if it works at all .
so wolfram alpha knows about many and many things .
and on one side , we have mathematica , with the kind of accurate , a lot of the more precise , and a big network of the brain , and a big network of the brain &apos;s capacity , can make a lot of lines .
so , with physical , we &apos;re actually used to go to the world and see that certain materials are making sense of certain technological purposes and so on .
a few years ago , i was pretty excited about discovery that there are candidates with incredibly simple rules that are successful , and also the general theory and gravity and at least the general theory of quantum mechanics .
sw : i think .
and during that time , i actually lost more relatives , and teachers who are going to be able to get me to hiv / aids .
you jump up . you wear red clothes .
and my mother was a woman , she didn &apos;t have a right on the property and automatically was all my family , but i had the right thing that was my family , so he had the right .
and the day of the actual ceremony , we were excited , and they were excited , and they didn &apos;t sleep all night .
he was wearing a little bit of a village , and that &apos;s not even a village that had not even been the streets of the streets . it was very attractive .
i promised him to be a girl , i would come back and do everything they would ask me from me .
when it was pregnant before marriage , the mother was responsible for this , and punished .
while we &apos;re talking about here , 125 girls will never be punished again .
consumers that represent 72 percent of the american gdp , actually , just like banks and companies , they &apos;re going to resolve their own , and they &apos;re going to be able to get to the daily life , and they &apos;re going to be able to make ourselves to make ourselves out of commitment and risks that are going to be able to go ahead when we move forward .
and what you see here is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we actually go to the future and basically future education , the future kids of our households .
and the more important thing is to go up 48 percent , the cornell institute .
we also observe a trend to something more sophisticated tourism . right ?
one of them is the most important of community and neighborhood , and we &apos;re going to get the neighbors to support the neighbors as support .
we also observe a big amount of energy .
the trend for the most powerful is enormous .
then we take the phenomenon of the millennium .
and then i came to the question , i &apos;m the only one that does something like this ?
you could use them .
that &apos;s what i do in my life -- stories tell novels , and today i want to share with you a few stories about art of storytelling and also about some of the supernatural creatures that are the most powerful .
our main system could be feasible . our hearts could be a equivalent , and our heart system could be more powerful , if we &apos;re in our cultural health system .
i was going to first first time , like i call it , &quot; representative heatherwick . &quot;
i &apos;m not an immigrant , no refugee or a computer , and i &apos;m going to ask why i do that . but that &apos;s what it allows me to invent myself .
he wanted to see a manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story became a huge issue , because i was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a huge thing .
literature has to lead us to the other side .
i could be a novel about a muslim woman , and maybe that &apos;s a happy story , and i might write a happy story , and i might write about a little bit of a more , gay professor in norway .
so you &apos;re going to be able to do it . you &apos;re already taking existing songs , cut it into small pieces , shapes these pieces , you put them together and you get a new song , but that new song is clearly made of old songs .
instead , these laws and laws worldwide use the more awkward comparison of property .
it &apos;s a kind of a computer system , but i &apos;m going to summarize what it &apos;s going to be called . the company &apos;s , the telephone , by the telephone , by putting a symbol with his finger .
our creativity comes from outside , not inside .
and then they say , &quot; okay , but how do you see your address ? &quot;
but in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the newspaper .
what &apos;s beautiful , you can probably see this limb there , a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a piece of a limb .
our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
now , this led to a understanding of nuclear structure , because it &apos;s going to be so much , that atoms have a single core , with the most important one , with the top of it .
this picture shows a galaxy , a more powerful , with , well , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think you can ultimately do the most powerful ideas for us , over our space in the universe and really the value of our home home .
this is here . this is at home . that &apos;s what we &apos;re .
and with every click and every touch of the screen , we &apos;re going to leave how to get the way the body and the street of our personal information all over our way to our own forests .
when our daughter sat on the most popular , i asked them , &quot; will you put a lot of value on musical competence ? &quot;
we can &apos;t even do this in this way .
well , i want to take you on this journey .
and because i was so much , and i was talking to my three-year-old birthday , i was not talking to my three-year-old birthday , just a day .
and they don &apos;t talk ... ?
and i explained to help a friend who understood my computer language that i was john francis , that i was not talking about life , that i was not talking to that , and that was the last time that someone would translate my sign sign .
well , i &apos;m going to go back my backpack again .
i started talking to myself because i had studied a lot of time .
but the most important thing was that i was thinking about every birthday about my silence , but never my decision , just to use my feet .
born and grew up in north korea .
sometimes i found little jobs in exchange against food .
i always worried that i would be standing back and back again .
i felt like that , because i had so much food to eat , but my father died of hunger .
but i think that your gesture of love and care can save life of another joseph , and thousands of other people can change the hope that still have hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings , but this was much stronger than i expected , and just to make it , and just to make a industrial , and as industrial .
but then i was very disappointed with my profession as an architect , because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for society , but for a convincing people , rich , the government , the government .
and then in the next year , in 1995 , there was a big earthquake in kobe .
so i ask myself what &apos;s a permanent and what a temporary building ?
but this is really necessary .
so we learn some of the most important things in our lives before we &apos;re born , in the womb .
so fetuses actually learn the certain language that &apos;s spoken in the world that they &apos;re born in the world .
it creates a mixture of the impact that are so respected and weird , like the woman itself .
why should malnutrition lead to the womb ?
you can also see the other eyes , but you can see with other eyes .
this trust in the world &apos;s most important is essential for every kind of kind of kind of thing .
the audience will be on the street of the world , which is very logical , but not with the agree , which is happening before your eyes . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , you might be able to be able to smile .
you may remember that as the most popular , okay , okay , as the biggest deal of all time .
if you &apos;re a high animal at the oecd , and someone says , &quot; what do you do for the hunger of hunger in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start a campaign campaign ?
this is actually a strategy and i don &apos;t argue that strategy is a role .
for me , all of this was the music .
now , if i use software , the camera is going to be the camera , and the point of the world &apos;s place is to the most important thing in terms of the world &apos;s population , and you have an abnormal .
i remember the poor needed something more sophisticated -- eat clothing , shelter -- what they didn &apos;t have .
i even felt a turn of shame .
now , because i heard him , i was excited about different reasons .
i was not even asked to be a donation of what was usually my way .
it &apos;s about the most important of the history of the poor and it &apos;s about giving us a possibility of being involved in the way that you would be a partnership , which is a partnership , which is based on a traditional way of the donation of the donation , crazy .
it &apos;s a very powerful combination of combination , a very strong combination .
now , the first thing is , the beginning of the beginning is , and it &apos;s very clear to me , and it &apos;s very clear to me that it &apos;s just a vehicle .
how does the future of humanity look like ?
now i &apos;m going to turn to the second big question : are we alone or there &apos;s other lives in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions show that we &apos;ve made remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
see this .
here are photos of me .
the rate is actually doubling all 18 months and every single member of the world &apos;s member of the world &apos;s disease , which is moore &apos;s law .
but what about them ? what will it do with them ?
they &apos;re in their perceptual , and they &apos;re in their perceptual , and occasionally they &apos;re going to be people who would not agree with their parents .
so we &apos;re interested in these things .
ancient generations couldn &apos;t do this experiments at all .
and i found that the first technology was in the form of the world &apos;s country in the form of the form of the form .
we can learn very much about it .
and i see the way that i &apos;m going to be able to protect my child , because with such a child , you don &apos;t get any minister alone , even a minister .
and secondly , she tells us that she had a degree of a gang , but some of the adaptations had gone from trees .
and now , our knowledge came from our ancestors in principle of adults , because the fossils , the most unlikely , missing .
the most popular thing is , the origin of humanity is exploring the origin of humanity in the vast ethiopia , and he talks about how he found the oldest skeleton of a circular child and what we can learn in africa .
and if all of the rules should be , you need a effective system to the review of the design and the way we &apos;ve found it in all of the trust .
it &apos;s considered a high seas , because the continent of the world &apos;s demands was except .
we need to work local , but also all the ocean ocean .
we need to create a new paradigm of the macintosh and respect .
carol &apos;s saying , &quot; i would pay to do what i do . &quot;
that was probably a very good idea .
and to say , i &apos;m a journalist , no substitute , so i want to design a sketch , like the present and the future .
finally , i think we have to think about whether we want to , that our reality is going to be -- and if , what it means for our idea of life and for everything , what &apos;s going on .
it looks like oil spills .
the symptoms of complex , that you have the strong and the most powerful opinion , which is the right solution to have no matter how hard the problem is .
cesar and i tried to write a paper for the new york times and explain how it works .
of course , we can .
and make a lot of money .
it &apos;s a higher thing for example , as the events of americans .
we &apos;re going to try and try and do it . probably everything goes wrong .
and immediately , immediately . &quot;
and the other thing was , it was always trying to prove , but he could never prove the guess .
i &apos;m saying that our approach is simply not worth .
china wants to have been achieved in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even go down .
the future is practical .
yes , it will become ugly , and yes , it &apos;s going to happen -- with safety in our lifespan -- but we &apos;re more than capable of overcome everything that &apos;s going on on us .
and here they come into play .
and what we need to think about is that if you dance in the fire , what &apos;s next ?
and we believed we can put these debt on our children , but imagine you .
everything else is a little bit more powerful .
this is the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what stage of development is the cell .
that should be amazing or ?
everything we have is a lot of time .
you &apos;ll be able to focus on the position of focus , or you can do a series of things that we can &apos;t do .
it &apos;s not 1,000 years in the distance .
we should be able to do this cheap , simple , simple , simple , and nobody &apos;s going to use them for their children . &quot;
and here we can see this average .
we can &apos;t risk that trust the customer of customers .
he only got 500 and had to get to 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a huge amount of water that they got , and he said , &quot; come back in a week , if you &apos;re sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the kind of web -- things that we all talk about -- is a little less than 5,000 days old .
of course , there &apos;s a internet since 5,000 days -- but the web only 5,000 days .
so if we say , the machine we &apos;re going to be a computer system is a human brain , a human brain if we look at the rate , and we &apos;re going to be six billion of the world &apos;s year , there &apos;s six billion of the world &apos;s year .
now it &apos;s not so -- if you make a table and things in work , a word document , you &apos;re not part of the web but you will be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people will be the extended senses of the machine . &quot;
it &apos;s going to be on the level of the parts or ideas or words , if you want to be scanned .
the last point i wanted to talk about is the idea that we &apos;re going to be able to do .
third , it will be ubiquitous more ubiquitous , and we &apos;re going to fill our entire environment and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i was convinced that the second was the second of jesus christ , that it was the sun &apos;s sun , and that i was particularly , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
these are the dead of the most successful .
and it allows everything . it makes everything logical .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas , how we line things .
this is a project that we &apos;ve just completed in the world &apos;s big world &apos;s world , which came directly from this process , it &apos;s the result of a variety of forces that are developing it .
and that led directly into another project .
it &apos;s actually a false mindset , because the hybrid is probably more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas are going to do young people .
and finally , one of the most interesting projects -- a computer company .
everybody &apos;s going to be on his neighbors .
so as we have to pay school .
so we have a big brain , a big advantage , because we can influence our environment .
my story , is the two brains . it may surprise you , our gut has a brain .
this is a very , very important , very important , because there can be a difference .
we &apos;ve learned to talk to the big brain , taste and reward , like you know .
he said , &quot; you know , eventually , we were all like animals and then not more . &quot;
these are men and women who can name the self today , and they can name 250 stars in the sky sky .
of course , the world &apos;s monks said that .
the main line , the post , the sun depends on the sun , is actually a kind of a kind of a light that &apos;s constantly flowing to the light that seems to be the most powerful , which seems to be the most powerful , called the world &apos;s street .
if you pray for the dead , you do these gestures with the hands that you &apos;re going to be up with your thoughts in the sky .
here &apos;s the place where the big mother has the most powerful in the world , which has the mountains that are creating the mountains and create the country that they call the heart of the world .
it &apos;s unique of human imagination .
this material that you all know is , but i think it &apos;s more likely to do it for toxic white stuff .
i put it in there , you fit in , because in a hundred years , my body can go back without a commodity in the earth .
it &apos;s a waste .
you can use it everywhere in the world , and not to take care of the world , or you have to take care of the way you have a lot of alternatives .
first of all , they start atoms in a special bottle .
i &apos;ve launched a competition four years ago , &quot; dance your ph.d. &quot; dance .
my country is covered with 15 trillion dollars .
and that &apos;s -- -- that &apos;s a lot more of the speakers than all the speakers and all the speakers that come to me .
and she thought about my work on mathematical models , which should be supported by evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience may not be , from deep , cultural reasons , they think it &apos;s boring -- and find a different pattern of a lot more interesting -- head-tail-head .
you can think about two types of things .
if you throw a coin , you get a sequence of head and number .
back to more secular , because of that you &apos;re busy with uncertainty .
and only at a percent of the way .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to take that to a sudden death in a family that remains the probability of another . &quot;
not as unlikely as one in 73 million , but yet pretty unlikely .
the whole quality of quality , the massive effects on the industrial process , is carried by statistics .
the most important one has saved hundreds of thousands of lives in the world .
a smart power of beef is going to prevent injury because the electricity is always recognized until a smart , more likely .
but , on the other hand , china is a more powerful one . a term from the way it &apos;s a term .
you have facebook , we have a lot of time .
yet , the teapot can create a very strong force , which is never in the history of china .
so , the chinese is looking at the same as a real medium , not just as a mere headlines .
how a big ted , isn &apos;t it ?
so in the last three years , in the last three years , it really changed , and they &apos;ve done more and more transparent because they don &apos;t have access to the data .
more chinese , the most common speech and human rights as your holiness , rather than a america &apos;s privilege .
many of you know that beethoven was seventh symphony symphony .
i don &apos;t say they can live a wonderful life .
girl : well , my sister can be pretty nerves .
the acoustics of music is much more complicated than the language .
this is a violin .
and it seems like his favorite , to try to try to figure out the death industry , which is the sound of the ground , and his skull has been on the pages of the pages .
cl : joseph is phenomenal . it &apos;s brilliant .
if i &apos;m going to get to this , in this particular audience , i see a special audience .
in many countries , this is another thing .
in this critical point in the dutch history , my father was at the shore of the stream of the stream in the middle of the stream .
the rate of civil wars and oppression has been down since the end of the cold war .
my soldiers use their weapons as tools of peace .
peter van : why i took a weapon of a gun
this program gets a form and then it &apos;s 250 dna sequences .
this is a kind of a computer system in the middle of the world &apos;s office , in the middle of the high school .
you can &apos;t let &quot; not let &quot; be . &quot;
i &apos;m very interested in both of them .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example of this , but there &apos;s actually a theoretical rationale for why technology has evolved in the way that technology is developed in the way .
now evolution of our species needed hundreds of thousands of years , and because of this interaction , evolution is basically the technology of the technology , to produce the next stage , which was the first step in the technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; so we can make good dimension .
over the last 50 years , we had 28 percent of the information in the world .
another big revolution is the most important .
to go back to our exponential growth of computing : 1,000 dollars of computing is about the brain of an insect or a mouse .
and in the year of the ministry of the trends , we &apos;re going to reach the full of these trends , and they have to celebrate , how often the antenna has made in the form of technology -- faster and faster when we get to this point .
you can get blessing and you get to get .
they &apos;re harder .
they were removed from the most popular .
because there &apos;s nothing in there . well , it &apos;s not going to be here .
dopamine is apparently the stuff that stands in connection with the world .
and then we call schizophrenia .
and he was so friendly to post the resolution and give us the resolution .
i mentioned in our little thought earlier , they &apos;re a sleeping in the african plain .
9 / 11 has a computer company . it &apos;s a conspiracy .
and we have our own own , and we have a product of product .
i was not as good as he , but we did it , and we did it , the n , the tracy , tracy , and bruce , and bruce , and bruce , was a great experience .
they said , &quot; let &apos;s say the truth &quot; and let &apos;s leave you .
musicians and activist peter shares his personal motivation , with the most powerful motivation for human rights , and told stories of active .
next , we asked ourselves how that do that ?
he recognizes the problem and knowledge with it . the dance is his favorite , that allows him to be able to get new .
the beetle climb up much less than the pill , when you &apos;re wearing it , when you don &apos;t wear .
here &apos;s our experimenter experimenter .
play a computer and watch what happens .
this is the universe of stephen hawking .
thank you .
and the argument that it makes fun to fall into this big adventure is not quite with my experience .
or , &quot; nice . you know , my grandmother is going to be a cruise in antarctica .
so the whole purpose of the presentation is to convince the gymnosophist that they are the entrepreneurs that they invest in and make a lot of money .
and next to the experience , a company to cause or something to lead -- that doesn &apos;t have to be a company .
there are no financially helped the world &apos;s disease , where there was no problems .
and you take them out of it -- on a solid , good path to top . right from beginning to the end .
if i happen to know someone that has made a device that &apos;s made .
no , they &apos;re not .
then you give me a quick bit of a quick .
even if the competition works after old patterns ...
it was hopefully all positive , positive , positive , positive .
if you follow my own , you &apos;ll have a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very emotional talk to the ones you are and to bring emotional .
i didn &apos;t know that , that &apos;s pretty cool .
statistically , one of them is a beetle .
if you &apos;re a little questionable , you might have a effect on it .
and then if you have enough , you can click another link .
we &apos;re at the end of the table , on the last place as the culture , innovation , not estimates .
so as we think and behave , our main power is broken .
we have a kind of a car memes -- serious to be .
but excuse me , the problems today aren &apos;t the problems of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the largest largest world &apos;s largest ?
it &apos;s very compact .
our thinking is backwards .
through a finite change , change , like transparency , change , like for example , and collaboration , collaboration , and not to promote this things , and not the things that are focused on results .
because only the challenge is the only way that things are always done , the only way to get rid of us is the old , the old , and new creative solutions for the problems today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we should do it together , and if we do that , and the ideas of play can share , we can transform bulgaria to something better .
the magazine for the world &apos;s magazine is , i think , &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master took me to the most powerful , because the most popular thing was that it was at the time .
after i had a gesture of a gesture , they were very -- there was a lot of time , and i worked there about six months .
nine days ago , i had a fire .
you know -- all of the stuff .
my kids , and henry , and henry .
we &apos;re going to be a bunch of magazines , and we did our homework , but where we looked at , we were surrounded by images like this .
this picture was literally born in seconds after i was put the baby in the poor and i brought it across .
rg : oh oh .
av : taboo number three : about his edwards , you don &apos;t talk -- but i &apos;m going to talk about my talk today .
the general opinion is that every aspect of my life has become better for the question of the birth of birth and family .
but you &apos;re stuck that you &apos;re going to get rid of the control of the way that we &apos;re going to be able to get our lives very much , and what &apos;s extremely satisfying .
rg + av : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s a consequence of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve all seen this star &quot; star &quot; with the most powerful .
imagine to hear big , already late , and you &apos;re going to be able to hear how to play personally . john &apos;s walker shows how images are going to be the exact defense and the most important to analyze them in the same way .
now , since we &apos;ve experienced a time of extraordinary economic , the longest distance in the history of this country .
but now , a few months later , like good politicians , like , &quot; in the 1940s apple , &quot; to bite the apple &apos;s apple , &quot; how to do it , you can &apos;t hide your uncertainty .
well , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i met this guy , a little bit of a time , a little bit of a chaotic man who was fed by soup and iron for completely .
but interestingly , it &apos;s also going to be a future that the society is a few tricks from capitalism , which is how you &apos;re going to be integrated in the dna , which is how you &apos;re trying to be embedded with the dna , and then the ones that work , and then the ones that work , and the ones that work , and the ones that work , and they work , and they work , and they work , and they work , and they work , and they work , and they work
i want to show you a fascinating new hypothesis , and some surprising new insights that i &apos;ve been working on , about the relationship between the structure of language that you talk to , and your tendency to save .
and if i want to talk right , it forces me , constantly thinking about it .
well , this is a kind of a theory of theory .
please push this device so you can get to the long-term hand , so i can measure your own hand .
it &apos;s the present pleasure in exchange for future pain .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important the ability to communicate about generations .
we &apos;re all english .
but i &apos;m about using them as a barrier .
but they didn &apos;t get the results that they wanted .
and i was on the same time , and i was on the field of the world &apos;s field , although i &apos;m a ph.d. in a hurry .
people and the humanities and the birds and the birds and all the ones that are going up here is the red line here . these are people , livestock and pets .
we focused on more serious energy of the future and produced products for the company .
let &apos;s see the next video .
this flew last night on the party , and -- you can see how it just was a little bit of the time , and you can see every single one you want to do .
and he was a little bit of a sudden about how people were doing the buddhist religion in india .
and he goes back as a broken man back to the village .
and he has to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , the smell and everything .
the animals are in one of their lives . people are people .
we &apos;re going to be a lot of the way we take the sense of memory , and we &apos;re going to take a very long one on the human beings in this meditation .
and you think about how the things are , if you &apos;re happy , if you &apos;re happy .
and of course they are cruel and they &apos;re cruel to others .
although the change is doing something for other creatures , they feel these new quality in you , and it &apos;s already helping you , and it &apos;s going to be a model of them .
so the coffee cup is the coffee cup , or the cup of the society used tools to get the public health .
interestingly , the complexity is very high .
we &apos;ve heard about bill gates .
so it &apos;s very , very simple if you know how to read it .
well , let me close with four general remarks , an example and two grapes .
and i don &apos;t want to stop with detail , but in the lower right-hand corner , you see a example of what we have for this .
did you start to do that ?
and this is what the most important thing is that the things that jimmy had talked about is what jimmy has been talking about , which is our new way of the organization , or better , how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things are always less able to be able to get it in the use of the way that we &apos;re going to be in collaboration with the most important .
take a for astronomy , which was the yochai mentioned .
it &apos;s also going to be a professional arguments .
so it &apos;s not going to give a argument two camp , but it &apos;s going to be all sorts of interesting positions that are taken from people .
this costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to get their own someone to get someone to get someone and actually did a team , between new zealand and spain .
and the first thing i thought was to thank him for it .
but the truth is that life is exactly happening here .
so people called the people and have news like this .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m like batman to true my anonymity . &quot;
and the one that has no data , so it turns out they were just moved into another city and had a new job .
and in the last 35 years , i studied human behavior on the basis of everything , started from genes about the brain of the brain , dopamine and the way to the world .
and some of you have it . and it &apos;s dependent on gender .

and you see how robust control is .
and he makes it , while he &apos;s obstacles .

and also , it has to be to keep a long time to get the world available , and to fix materials and the more sophisticated .
you take somebody like me , a scientist , analyzed and you &apos;ve developed a new technology , and it &apos;s determined to be a new technology .
because i hope you &apos;re taking this today from here , a new connection with nature .

two of the things were involved in the project : warner brothers and the most powerful .
and we had enough passion to make the most important and technology .
so we &apos;re so excited about motion capture .
the number was infinitely to be infinitely .
and these are the data you get , and then it &apos;s used for the model .
and so the finished picture looked like that in the movie .
this was a very , very early sample .
and we found this , in the middle of the state of the state .

but what would you have not been doing , if you had the modern communications to create a sense that against the wrong , that was going to be done , immediately , something needed to be done ?
combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate on global level and organize global , and organize global nature with the challenges that are now now .
in the museum of the children in rwanda , there &apos;s a photograph of a young boy -- and the museum of children &apos;s life , the children who were left when they were in the most popular of rwanda .

this is the driving algae as driving algae .
boy : namaste .
let &apos;s slow up to see the spines in action .
mark parker at stanford , one of my partners , is an extraordinary engineer , which is a technology called manufacturing manufacturing , where he can offer directly into a artificial foot .
you can see almost like aliens , and the secret , what they &apos;re going to stick , are their own toes .
here we are going to go down the band-aid .
these are the spines that allow the spines to be the spines , and the most important , and the most important , difficult surfaces , difficult surfaces .
so , the long beautiful songs that are going to be used as a lot of beautiful songs , and the males are also allowed to find each other and choose a partner .
so if dolphins are less than 20 feet away , they have to be less than half the time .
if we think of marine disasters for animals like dolphins , we need to be about the consequences of our surgeries in clear , which we thought of right .
after the most popular , the marine marine system made these systems to experience the systems that could hear the scientists .
you just hear the low frequencies .
if males and females use this signal to find a partner and they &apos;re scattered , they &apos;re going to imagine what the impact of the world would have been able to do on recovery .
as ships can be made of the way , they found that with a better , more powerful of this noise to be reduced to 90 percent of this noise .
they &apos;re the speed of 50 percent , the speed of 50 percent .
we see strangers , we see strangers , 300 , 300 , and it will always be more . and they &apos;re not like us .
you all have the possibilities available .
we observe a continuous rise in the men .
and obviously there &apos;s a hundred times , the hundred .
with initiatives like 100 dollars , it &apos;s a little bit of a laptop that we think of a whole new generation of people in the old computer computer .
thank you .
i think nothing that is the problem .
and our daily lives are , but , in a remarkable state , we say , in a remarkable state , we say in a very reactive state .
normally , it &apos;s one or two per year .
and there are you !
but we are much more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more .
part of the challenge was to try to try and do rhythm and space by not just my hands -- it &apos;s much more powerful -- but the rhythm of my body and the feet , and the balls with my feet .
and then they play crazy .
ok , because they don &apos;t understand what a computer is , i give you a little hint .
now , again , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
you have somebody up here , which is the most common principle of the whole life , ok ?
turn -- and then it comes to calm . just a little number about time .
with space and straight in the room , in other ways .
and then the levels of levels .
in this year -- you could see the slides -- in this year , we &apos;re wearing the most powerful with us , a project that we &apos;ve helped the design of the design .
we can call this one on a computer system which allows you to put more information over the clothes while you &apos;re going to get these kinds of things .
and in the cassini scott adams : i &apos;ve noticed that i &apos;m on the way to be the leading expert in the world .

but also many of the very much on the right , which apparently has been influenced by propaganda .
if you &apos;re going to get the tar , it means &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot;
if i walk to this pink sound for longer than some minutes , they would literally stop hearing it .
many people escape to headphones , but this turn big , public spaces like this , shared spaces , in millions of small personal personal personal .
you can also do that in a beautiful place , like a lake .
and finally , an acronym .
and i said , &quot; this is my job . &quot;
thank you so much that you &apos;ve got here . we &apos;re all grateful . &quot;
and so they went away .
because they were not at the sidewalk , and they couldn &apos;t see the exchange between me and my bonus , a exchange that was fair to us , but alien , but alien .
now , i &apos;m going to tell you , in the last year , there was a lot of competition , because the arab spring is still spreading out , which is still the most common -- what else ?
this photograph was actually in a police police , and see the ground of the people who were tracking by the police .
the kids just do photos in a class who get teachers , they &apos;re going to paste them on the top of the world .
today , it &apos;s about the brain and , yay , somewhere out there , there &apos;s a kind of a computer .
this is something we can work in our lifetime . i thought i can make a difference and i tried to get out of the most powerful , and i tried to get out of the most powerful , in the most powerful .
but sometimes science has some other properties that they really really do interesting .
what do we bring more data ?
there &apos;s something that we believe , it &apos;s obvious , but wrong .
it &apos;s so that intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we don &apos;t look at the alligator as a very intelligent , not in a human way .
in humans , we developed the most powerful part of the world &apos;s name with the name of the neocortex , and nature has created this little trick .
it &apos;s not that you look at it , and say , &quot; what am i seeing now ?
not like a computer company . not in the least like a computer company .
these are the things that are going to come first .
we need something police , we need something military , but only to defense .
you can see it on your own . &quot;
she went , because she was at the time of the election outside the country .
this is a lot of the time that &apos;s the most powerful thing .
and then , when they were the door , grandma said , &quot; no , no , no , no .
they wash this : by hand .
these group uses three , every one .
it &apos;s real .
she did to learn english and learn this as a foreign language .
the computer has already , and that &apos;s one of three participants .
if you think of it differently , you think of the employer of the united states , which was actually part of our experiment , because that &apos;s exactly what we did .
we repeated the experiment with the same groups , but a continuous one between the enlightenment , as we deal with the data , and the actual beginning of the gold system .
the price of this is the defining of paradise .
and they moved and they were going to get to each other and they were leaving their arms and they were going to get their arms out of each other and they get them .
we &apos;re really good at talking about skills and security and health , we &apos;re really bad at talking about character .
then you ask personal coach , the most powerful like the bad breath in the world .
i &apos;m not really feeling with emotions .
the first gift , or talent , is a little bit of the ability to be in the heads of other people , and find out what they have .
they own the humility of humility .
this is what the unconscious is looking at .
we found them between the most violent , raped by many , many men , i don &apos;t know how many .
where does your journey start ?
and that it &apos;s not normal to live in a home .
what was my challenge ?
they need their empathy .
lexicography : the process dictionaries .
now , first of all , i &apos;ll give the queen because it &apos;s funny .
online online , it must be different .
the bad words -- look , if someone thinks , and then it doesn &apos;t think it &apos;s on the map , then he thinks , &quot; this map sucks ! &quot;
you think , &quot; ok , if we think that words are tools that we use to give our thoughts to the idea of what &apos;s going to be better than a hammer ?
the mere one has 33 different definitions of the set of definitions .
and then there &apos;s this mike of the mike . mike &apos;s lives in britain .
i have the whole time , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary said .
so , i &apos;m a chair .
and , to make a long story short , i ended up .
and so , for a piece of play , while this three days , you start to understand , why do i hear all of this kind of thing ?
they &apos;re maybe from a ted speaker and we can keep the conversation in the year , and next year , after the same intellectual and emotional journey .
the manufacturers don &apos;t have the most sophisticated , not in their cheap , because they &apos;re not sure what the public would start with a very precise denial that could actually fold on the palm .
there was insecure , whether that was already the white , and it was technically not able to find the channel .
instead of being able to get the most powerful , you &apos;re going to get them .
and , &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
we call ourselves the &amp; amp ; it &apos;s a , and we live and we live in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this work is the cartoon of a human being .
we debate about the case &quot; what the world needs now , is nuclear power -- right or wrong ?
and now , there &apos;s only three of these -- coal and gas , the almost all over the way -- and nuclear , which is almost all over the way -- and nuclear .
we &apos;ve become the russian of the russian millennium by being transformed in electricity .
and the emissions are the main emissions of all greenhouse emissions and particles that are causing warming , and to co2 .
now , if you look at the fact that the prevalence of nuclear weapons is going to be the spread of nuclear nuclear power , because we know india and pakistan were developed nuclear weapons through the nuclear weapons in the world .
for wind , the area is much bigger , but the most powerful is smaller .
the reality is that 21 states are nuclear power , right ?
and in the senate of the united states , we need both parties -- just one or two voices are necessary to be able to be able to do global warming in the senate , and this room can help .
we &apos;re not going to get enough of renewables .
i &apos;ve been worried about the 10 years of this .
thank you .
this was -- my motivation was from apollo .
and the first time we have enough wealth in the hands of some less people , and the available technology , the economic technology that will allow us to study the space of space .
26 groups of seven countries took the competition , every one between one and 25 million dollars from .
and we can get them to the space station .
and the advantage for the funders is the sum of the world &apos;s sum and the social system .
would you surprise us , &quot; we &apos;re fascinated ?
that means that surfaces can cut themselves . they can become incredibly small .
a challenge was how we can express these new algorithmic order in a pillar .
what i didn &apos;t know about time because we &apos;ve just seen the outside , was that the surfaces continue to go on , within the column , the plank was a pretty surprising discovery .
inspired by the process of the cell cell michael , michael &apos;s algorithms , the incredible , fascinating forms with millions of surfaces , not a human being , but you can create it , but you can build our understanding of architecture .
so look at this picture here -- a lot of forms here for you .
it &apos;s a very rare disease .
this is a drug that was developed for cancer .
you can see , the chip actually is the most important thing to do .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s led by young people .
and i think many people here in the room are in the room , many of them are in the same position as i .
so i think women are going to be in our society because they realize that it &apos;s very important for their future generations , our cultural identities .
we &apos;ve realized that since recently , people have been using the means of youtube and social networks to give their stories to show their stories and their own stories with their own voices .
at the same time , we &apos;re going to go to the same hand , and we get our part of the world to explore .
so i became more or less than &quot; nothing &quot; .
so i thought , &quot; maybe if i do this ants a few apartments , they pull it up there . &quot;
this was called &quot; the &quot; odyssey house . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do that ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back to the next day .
and it went ...
my work , roughly estimated , sometimes five , six or seven weeks ; that can &apos;t always reveal .
and i &apos;m going to turn it around , and it shaped the car .
so i broke the needle .
it &apos;s a very powerful work , but the best things come in small plastic .
they expect their employees to do what they asked them if they did the task , they can do more more , they can do more .
there &apos;s this absolute concentration of his , this absolute , absolute , which is absolute , consciousness , a absolute center of compassion and love that &apos;s defined the primary properties of the divine .
my favorite body flew in a direction , my favorite wheel in the other .
i asked all the walks that i probably didn &apos;t do with you , which i would not be able to do , the friends i would not be able to do , the friends i wouldn &apos;t be able to do with them .
because you don &apos;t need the most important thing .
and if you &apos;re going to get them from the back , against the wind , you can just get it out and it &apos;s going to be a little bit of the time . &quot;
20 years ago , doctors had taken my leg and hoped , and there was a 15 year-old chance of doing it .
as i was more and more , and in my life , i was probably 14 pounds easier to be more than i am now .
and nobody represents this modern system in my eyes more than david black .
so , go upright , you say , is the threshold of what makes us human .
he &apos;s president of the international union for the world &apos;s largest name , which is the least name of the name that i &apos;ve ever heard .
he was born three months early , and it was really a fantastic kind of a fantastic amount of him .
so once i tried to approach the piano , i became a lot of a lot of time .
and at the end , you were so fast that things like &quot; flight &quot; no problem , right ?
do you want to hear me ?
dp : &quot; tiger pen . &quot;
i don &apos;t do that .
they &apos;re fighting their own lifestyle in this forest , in a world that is clean , a world that &apos;s still not inappropriate , in a world that &apos;s not even more profitable .
so we know that they &apos;re capable of solving the research that has been impossible for absolutely impossible than i started .
the long loving value of the mother , the mother who developed during this long childhood , and also the siblings can remain the whole life , and that can be the whole life .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and also the vast camp of the forest in the forest now needs meat , and so the pygmies , which are in the congo , and in their wonderful lifestyle , they &apos;ve been born in the most wonderful lifestyle .
yesterday , someone said that , somebody said that .
now , we &apos;re in every state , and the problems in florida are other than the new york .
come on and turn me down here ?
there in the politicians ?
what we want to do in the lab is so pretty much the same , but with a few dozen of different types of molecules -- such an economic reduction of complexity , but yet , trying to create something more sophisticated .
it &apos;s actually very much more powerful . if you &apos;re going to form it , it &apos;s actually not really something .
now where they &apos;re all experts for protocells , we &apos;re going to play with these protocells .
we see the self-assembly of these body from oil oil , which we &apos;ve seen before , and the black blobs of these black mud represent this black mud -- this diverse , organic black mud .
in his lab , martin is going to be a &quot; protocells &quot; , experimental blobs of chemicals that behave like living cells , and his work shows how life could be done on earth -- and maybe elsewhere .
this is a kind of a computer , to get your tadpole on the night .
what &apos;s the -- where did you know that ? you &apos;ve taken it .
but if we were in every -- every fire fire , we could redefine the death of the death .
the roman is the emperor of the way that otherwise in your beautiful pink lungs , and it &apos;s going to be brought into connection with --
the birds could jump from one to another .
you can get the current news from him . you can talk to him .
but this herd to keep a big sensitivity is demand by our planet .
next , we &apos;re going to multiply the skin cells and multiply it in a computer .
we &apos;ve been working with thousands of years of the years of the time , and we started with products like wine , beer and yogurt .
it &apos;s true that if we &apos;re going to do our research in the world , we see that it &apos;s almost a universal pursuit of people after that , a car .
let me just talk about hydrogen .
this is a huge opportunity to create energy , mobile energy .
if we see these things , it &apos;s also the other thing that &apos;s going to be .
you had to survive .
and we &apos;ve been sure of our school school to be able to get funding and support .
because why should our students drive so far away from their own ?
it became a book , then a presentation .
there was an incredible idea of a incredible idea , a crazy idea .
here &apos;s the west coast of the west coast , they destroyed their forest .

so i don &apos;t have to go closer to this .
you make the equivalent of what &apos;s supposed to remain .
this is a building building .
one example that we all know is that the cell phone is .

we use a lot of money to ensure that we don &apos;t die at a computer system , but we &apos;re almost not going to be in a way , and yet , it &apos;s completely preventable .
we don &apos;t want to be caught back on the wrong foot .
i hope that &apos;s going to be .
this is very , very important because this is the system , the forest , from the life , and it &apos;s now for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing insight . and we &apos;ve only been knowledge for this .
and that &apos;s what the system was going to be , a number of places in the southern hemisphere , in these circles .
everybody who comes to this is just taking on the database and can get the information to be able to do that for everything , which is what &apos;s happening .
we &apos;re to ride the wave , the technological possibilities .
in a earthquake , big amounts of these new microbes that we never saw before , from the sea floor .
the most popular john &apos;s network creates a network of the cameras , and sensors that our oceans are doing for global , interactive lab -- and a more powerful about the world of deep .
so i think that optimism is moving forward .
so again , radical versus conservative .
the most obvious thing about the obvious thing is , you know , too often , you know , you know .
our intellectual desires are complex .
you know that it &apos;s true ; the cathedrals , as unexpected , will always be unexpected .
but i &apos;m going to play something completely unknown , and even with mistakes , rather than repeat the same thing that &apos;s going on from his backpack .
risks of rooms that were never so much as much as they should be in a very walkable city .
there &apos;s the emotions of victims .
daniel ornish builds on very large ideas , and he &apos;s called 17 terms of the architecture of architecture -- raw , routine , more subtle , radical , radical -- and inspiration for every bold creative pursuit .
it also has the lowest of all the cars of these size .
so , do something really , really , can you be a few more , or will it be a few more powerful ?
em : it just has to . if not , we &apos;re in big trouble .
and with this capital , and installed the streams of the cards , the panels on the roof and then it &apos;s a monthly , and then the doctor &apos;s book is a monthly , which is lower than the electricity .
we &apos;re almost failed , but we &apos;ve come to 2008 .
it &apos;s similar to a jet jet .
how about everything in the world could be a person &apos;s innovative ?
look at this .
boy , if you &apos;re going to get our livestock , and you see a cheetahs like it eats one of our goats , it &apos;s very nervous to him .
we suffered hunger .
our tradition looks like this : in every single single single single world , there &apos;s a holy fire .
so , until now we were with support wildlife fund in the position of wildlife fund , which is very small programs to programs with the value of the value .
very important -- we invest the money in enlightenment and hiv .
and the most powerful -- again , a lot of a lot of the world &apos;s population -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful means .
and we hide this price behind huge winning .
dan pollan and alice , the grey revolution for environmental food .
and the tanks , tags , oysters , the , the , the , the most popular , the most famous species -- these were the known species .
this is like a bacchanal of protein .
science looks the world through the mind , and the way that we can be measured , and they can be described , but they can be able to know the art for knowledge and insight .
from a few cameras , after three weeks , a plan was a plan with 25 .
this is the natural cycle .
that would usually not do a photographer photographer , a photograph that &apos;s going to be a picture , right ? but sometimes it must be to show the dimensions .
here you see the glacier goes back .
this is a couple of cameras .
could india be the origin or a global center for innovation , just like this , as it has become a global center for the world &apos;s world and the most powerful ?
if we asked people to be in the world in these kinds of things that they were working on , they said , &quot; we work on global products . &quot;
you can &apos;t be a professor if you weren &apos;t also student .
the best hospitals , in the doctors , would go to the doctors , and at d-rev , heart disease , heart disease , heart disease , for artificial , to four o &apos;clock in the morning .
it works a little bit like -- that &apos;s a recently a recently , a recently of the time for four o &apos;clock in the morning .
i said , i know a very profound message when i see one .
everybody in our society comes to touch with cancer -- if not personally , then through a beloved people , a family family , a fellow , a friend .
in this space room , the genetic material , the chromosomes , within a nucleus .
we &apos;ve applied tumor fields in the lab at 20 different cancers , and we see this effect in all of this .
he got the most popular .
but what we can see is that in sixth month of the tumor , it &apos;s going to be responding to the tumor .
this is just the beginning .
this is a new workplace , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re 15 feet deep , and collect rainwater from the roof , there &apos;s a little pipe , and from their courtyard .
so water from 300 , 400 miles away , it &apos;s going to be like this .
somewhere goes a stream or a stream through this scene .
this is called &quot; raw &quot; . in english , we have a little bit of the time , and water .
and you have to go further .
these are the beautiful stairs we just saw on one of the images .
and the most important thing is , in the way , 600,000 percent of the people are getting hiv in sub-saharan africa .
10 percent from india .
they will get the jobs in the nanoscale that are bringing people out of the most violent and they get to the way in the way , and they get to the way to get the spread of the world .
and the countries to the right , because you see the most important thing , basically , every country with a computer of a , say , less than 5,000 dollars , a computer of say , we &apos;re going to say three .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s , &apos; 60s , india grew up not so right .
buy african products .
but i think a much bigger problem is that this logic -- that we should be ipods and not bombs -- i mean , it would be a great title for thomas , new book for thomas .
so , 500 people have chosen to get to the world , and four of them were selected to visit the institution and so they were to get to the way to get to the way that they &apos;re going to be to be able to get to the .
so now , citizens with the planning to 2020 is not necessarily changing anything about it , because it still is the dictators that control the agenda .
so , the internet is the internet , the internet is the worst expectations ?
&quot; how a man . &quot;
and he was standing with us younger guys .
because for me , that &apos;s in this time , and in this time , the question was , &quot; you want to be ? &quot; you want to be ? &quot;
i was paralyzed , people .
as indians , and now politicians and the other politicians , i &apos;m pretty much around the most important , which is our country , worried about india , all the talk about india , even the new superpower .
with other words , all sorts of things tell us about countries , regardless of whether they want to be able to get to the daylight or not .
but the lightning in our country at the time is pretty slow , and it took about half an hour to a call .
it can &apos;t understand the glory .
this can sometimes have repeated consequences . ok .
and that from you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , to see how many of the most powerful ones are there , the most important thing to explain is that the most powerful thing is to explain .
i went home and i was doing a little bit of a little bit . i found some scary statistics .
and the most powerful thing is , a bathroom without water .
and now i feel like george bush .
now , this title , this expression , comes from a critic , a early critic and this is a passage that i just love , and i would like to read them : and i &apos;d like to read them .
and that &apos;s a good thing , because if it would be like this , mother nature would have a problem : how about everything in the world we get to mate ?
this is the hardest part , which is not obvious , and therefore i &apos;ve got it for the conclusion .
ok ? stop .
i don &apos;t know why there are a lot of time , but no matter , they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you .
i actually suspect that the most important thing is that the most important thing is that we &apos;re going to know how we &apos;re very , very quickly , very quickly .
it &apos;s like this . you should see this like this .
bob mckim has a different -- another version of this practice in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned that with time : you get a much better to get a lot more creative results if all of the rules are holding .
and suddenly there was a productive conversation about design about a real object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little skeptical , i &apos;ll come back to it .
you know how it feels , all these uncertainty , as long as you go back in the corridor , as you can take a more , in the most of the most powerful , and you ask yourself what &apos;s going on here .
so , we would all feel sure and we would have a good time , because we agree with the rules and agreed with it .
we do everything that leads to success , but then if we &apos;re there , we believe that we &apos;ve done it . we &apos;re satisfied to be happy and hear all that , and listen to all that , all that &apos;s done to do what &apos;s done .
i was faster , but as depressed .
i learned that success is not a street street .
and the most powerful is just full of hotter girls . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh my god , &quot; -- hopefully , for always , the last time in public .
he certainly hired that everything is going to be .
it took 900 people to do it .
and the second thing is that people are obviously experiencing a real connection .
these are questions .
as you see in modern liberal democracies , society allows us to determine the state of our self , our self , but it also requires us from us .
it means we &apos;re going to meet our full potential as human beings .
so these are the layers that i wanted to do , and that &apos;s what i wanted to do today -- the question : what are the intentions that come to use , if you design something ?
so i said , and my colleague sebastian , and i said , &quot; well , there must be better ways .
and we were successful .
i &apos;m going to give you one in the fall .
he &apos;s going to be in the right position , and they &apos;re going to be with his nose , and it &apos;s beating .
we learned the first surprise .
it had to give any kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a force to make the way that we observe and the speed of the system .
a load cell is measuring forces and that &apos;s actually a laser cell cell with a crystal in inner .
this is the most popular -- here &apos;s the heel , and that &apos;s going to be a little bit of the load and hit the load cell .
a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very much .
and i &apos;m not in the world , it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean .
i think that &apos;s one of the most beautiful classical of the most beautiful classical .
i don &apos;t know other people &apos;s own , not even more , that &apos;s just that it &apos;s a three-dimensional space .
now you see that -- he just makes me stand .
the submarine , the last year , was this one .
true is the understanding of architecture as a computer designer , and it &apos;s a little bit of the obvious example -- you &apos;re not excuse the obvious example of that , it &apos;s not the right approach we need to choose .
basically , new york on the back of the world &apos;s office was built in the back of the world &apos;s own .
in these eight side of the office , they put small types of water , which are basically going to be the most profound .
so you went around in london and was overwhelmed by this smell .
finally , the star created a map of the outbreak .
and that &apos;s what happens every second week .
i made her portrait on the top of the top of the temple .
and in this area of the amazon , in 1997 , oil was discovered .
the other side of the field is the courts , where actually , bin laden is supposed to be a store . that &apos;s a little bit of a time .
this was one of the great things .
this is the most powerful . let me continue to continue and show you the hubble field of deep field .
but then you get to jupiter and that &apos;s 40 minutes away . that &apos;s a problem .
that &apos;s going to be part of the beginning that it &apos;s going to be the beginning of the universe .
we just have a million galaxies .
so this is the stuff that seems to know in the picture , dark matter .
when you saw this picture for the first time , you don &apos;t see much in it .
this simulation was done with 1,000 processors a month , just to make this visible .
we &apos;re asking a resolution that &apos;s about this picture of the earth that is in the world that you can actually see the complicated pattern of earth .
and in the consequence , we are stressed .
47 percent .
this is crazy . we &apos;re all doing that , even in the everyday life .
i went into a cycle . that led to many pain and problems with the joints so i couldn &apos;t hold anything more .
so i asked myself , could you be creative if you look for intent to the limitations ?
the whole thing happened to the morning .
that &apos;s the adapt of the way that it &apos;s a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a time , as well as a computer company , and there &apos;s a lot of the way that we &apos;re going to monitor the environmental system , and the characteristic of the financial system .
stalin &apos;s &apos; 30s , the 30s , the &apos; 60s , killed millions of people , were watching the nazis , they saw the nazis , they were going to be the nazis , and many of the women were raised as a while to germany .
because that &apos;s what the grief brings . &quot;
and as a psychologist , the idea of most , that we &apos;ve learned what we learned in the virtual world about us , and we could use our identity , using a better life in the real world .
we used to be used to a new way of being together alone .
human relationships are a mild , chaotic and the most powerful .
it &apos;s the most important thing .
because in the moment , in the people alone , even for a few seconds , they will be more , they &apos;re going to panic , they get panic , they get to a electronic device .
but we &apos;re in danger , because in fact , the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently , we didn &apos;t seem to won every one with the most violent , which had some of our students , and pretty often -- -- pretty often , i felt that they had their predictions on financial ways .
maybe because my father &apos;s father has always read .
so i had it in quiet -- but it had to be very happy and happy .
and finally , i thought a pyramid , but i &apos;m missing the time , and i &apos;m going to take the time to take it out .
although you lose , not fear of failure when we have all of them , because who can be more desire to give a person , when everything he &apos;s doing .
if i should call names , i never know a answer .
did i have enough of the time ?
the second challenge would be cells .
today , in many clinical trials , different kinds of stem cells are used for heart disease .
just last month , it &apos;s done with this technology that makes human beings .
we can map them , and then turn to 360 degrees and analyze the kidney in all their own properties , and then we can just scan this information and print it by the water .
i couldn &apos;t put in school . i was just going to go .
i was a kid , i said , &quot; yes , i want to do that . i want this surgery .
you may notice that a new area is developed , called the compiler .
and connected to this kind of thing , there were examples of the world -- from the choice of a president to the most violent wikipedia , and everything between the fact is -- the challenge of a lot of the things could achieve .
third , more powerful , affordable environmental issues .
because what they need is that this is the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want a cd , i want to do the music that she plays .
i &apos;m hot and i &apos;m a member of kenya in kenya .
we need to have our women and children , we need to run . &quot;
i try to improve infrastructure .
late in the night i went home with batteries and ice .
together , anybody have a lot of a professional ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , the master &apos;s master in moscow , and working in full-time and work in full-time .
that can be huge spending , but if the city can win a number of x volunteers for y hours , the most important work is the most important work of the city .
they have a lot of the time , tables and data .
so these are , in the 18 minutes , that i &apos;ve been given to talk to you , to talk about two and the people who are going to be in cities .
and he was in a very reactive mud .
the buildings here have several stories .
these green things in the foreground are mangoes .
and if you &apos;re a legal system , you have political activities .
i couldn &apos;t know that i would be part of a technological revolution that would be true to that dream .
think about it . these men who didn &apos;t have the same kind of thing that i had helped me , helped me get to their relatives , more powerful , more powerful in law .
and then , in the time , they were usually working with a computer company , but by using a computer company , and he used a machine , and he could develop a machine that could read every single one of the things that could read every single one .
but you know , i think it &apos;s very lonely to let me read about machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books over the border , to be in the different english countries , different versions of the world , the u.k. , canada , canada , australia , australia , and new zealand all of the different types of harry potter .
the most important thing . life expectancy has been doubled for a more than doubled and it grows with a speed of five hours a day .
another thing . do you wish people like me , okay ?
second , the new machine machine is so good news , because , once the approval work , we don &apos;t have to do that , and we have to do that and we have to get it to the power of the power and the computer .
the social challenges of this inequality should be seen .
the economic game is surprising , and surprisingly straightforward , especially on short point .
and my biggest concern is that we create a world with a world , with a little bit of a different society , embedded in a slightly more sophisticated society and supported by a economy that is going to be able to promote inequality instead .
and i started feeling more of the years of the years of god .
some have a lot of the time that we can only believe in a god that tells our pain .
in the second , the line is going to follow the wind and waves .
so who is god , if not the big thing or the big thing ?
the loving soul of the universe .
by looking at the god in the inner . by my own melting of my own .
one of the first things i started to explore was the story of the world &apos;s technology .
we &apos;ve been found no more sophisticated , which was older than 40 years . and the average age of these hunters and collectors is 20 to 30 to 30 .
our bodies have used to this new diet .
so these equality of energy and matter , the einstein showed and also the modern science of the most important , entropy and information and matter and the matter of all together , so it &apos;s a long continuum .
this is a robot that wants to go to your own plug to get more electricity .
and what i mean with that is that we &apos;re looking for your new job .
a great development , which started billions of years ago , moves through us and puts it on . and our choice is kind of in technology , is really in the technology , it &apos;s really , really , really , to be able to be able to do that .
they said , &quot; well , we have five classes of 30 to 40 students .
we were going to go down and found beautiful , beautiful bars , and it had the look -- while we &apos;ve said , &quot; you know what , you know what , it looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
so we waited , we sat on the tables and they waited .
there are many of the most powerful things . the only problem , especially for adults that are working in the events that didn &apos;t really know anything as they started , that there was only a toilet .
the teachers we work with -- everything is different for teachers -- they say what we should do .
about 170 tutors have worked with them on the book and so that &apos;s how it works .
and right behind behind -- there &apos;s usually a little chain -- right behind it , they &apos;ve been taught how kids were taught .
there &apos;s also these kinds of things -- it &apos;s a shelf that you don &apos;t see if you &apos;re going to be in the middle of the world , but it &apos;s slow down .
he &apos;s a little bit of a time . he &apos;s bringing his cousins .
he writes a email , he will ask you every question that you can answer .
i was this girl .
eighty percent of refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s a side that thinks that peace means the end of the struggle , and there is a side that thinks that peace is creating the creation of schools and jobs .
she sent her children to school -- found a new home .
there &apos;s one , which is a manual for complete idiots , you knew that ?
on cape , there &apos;s a street street , and we &apos;re all going to drive here .
this is my baby . thank you very much .
he basically said , &quot; i designed everything . &quot;
and in a certain sense , i always felt bad .
so i came up with this kind of complications .
i found that cheetos are very good at the same time .
college is the most difficult thing , so number 10 hard --
from all in a strange , very strange , about a window , that &apos;s a window , to the moment , in which the street had been black , and that white the street was there in the sun .
and i was reminded by the great presentation of karen armstrong , that religion really understood nothing with faith , but to do with behavior .
the most powerful , the same size , the same size . it doesn &apos;t look like that , but it &apos;s exactly the same size as the united states , the united states , the one area that &apos;s about the state of arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the developed developed .
we can &apos;t wait to wait for the most popular , the australia had to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of our entire civilization .
a new appreciation of the most important , which we have through the assumption of this challenge .
before i show you a few pictures to the preview , i want to point on this beautiful detail about the design of the design and design .
rca is really an extraordinary school in this respect .
we &apos;ve been talking about keith , and we &apos;ve been talking about keith , that many scientists don &apos;t tend to show something beautiful in their talks , from fear , to be considered stupid .
here &apos;s what you &apos;re going to print in the 3d , which is a very interesting thing to print .
so that makes us think more about what robots mean for us .
no . so i had to think a little bit of a little bit .
we did the same for iraq .
that was a challenge we had to ask as a physicist .
we can push it up . the forces are more , more of them , and there are more of them , but they &apos;re satisfied .
&quot; &quot; congratulations seven &quot; a whole band
and there are some employees in foundations that call this &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; . &quot;
the idea of justice , which shows our lives , and we have a sense of what &apos;s right in life , which is just in life , which is what we should do , social justice .
and as this is , he &apos;s a while of the most powerful .
so every week , the most popular thing would come to come . &quot; god , you &apos;ve answered me again . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , a infection , a infection or surgery .
the muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- the way that it .
we treat them with the drugs -- the ones -- the , frankly , in this kind of pain , is not very effective .
now you get a sense of how much rock we talk about here .
it was 1908 . nothing . it can do it .
i don &apos;t know if you can see it from the back rows of all the time . these are just stars .
in 2005 , nasa started a probe called deep impact , which is a -- that &apos;s a part of a comet in the core of a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , like i said , engineers .
the difference between dinosaurs and us is that we can have a more powerful and choose , and we can change our future .
and i &apos;ve led to this time , and i led to the only independent , to be exactly the only electronic medium of the country .
and i thought that the most important thing is , and a great company would be if the limbic was just gone , what was going on as a right thing .
and at the end of the meeting , he says , look , it &apos;s not going to work , you &apos;re never going to see your money again , but my foundation will be 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test the idea .
and we said , this is okay , we &apos;re fine , we &apos;re going to make your business plan with what you actually did .
see , we &apos;ve started in east and central central , and we went to russia .
after a while , we opened a little bit of a time .
and we &apos;ve developed the idea , and we &apos;re spending , bonds on the free press .
and in this way , you organized the funding , so that there &apos;s no more a blind , not a blind , the running cell cell , to find .
so why does that work ? this is the question .
well , some of the things that are called a theory of everything .
just an example is that this : newton found the law of gravity , that works like a square through the square of the world &apos;s objects between the other objects .
the more symmetry you have , the better you &apos;re going to be the simplicity and elegance of theory .
one thing he thought was most of us today as given , but he was not of course .
it doesn &apos;t make the meaning of knowing that they follow the laws of the laws , and accidents .
but he read in every free moment he had , books .
from this ambition , he &apos;s driven to the most powerful .
but when he was just in the way that he was to put his signature under the most violent , his hand was deaf and he was screaming because he had a thousand hands of a day .
not very surprising -- it was only three women under the 16 house in the white house .
but i have to say , the older i was , the more i understand what a incredible privilege was , with this aging lion of a man so many hours .
and so like lincoln told the story , all after the war after the u.k.
i asked my father under tears : &quot; what can we only do ? &quot;
what the reason is that i &apos;m always grateful for this strange love to the story that allows me to spend a life in back to the past .
he had the temple , and he had a temple .
this is the most important thing that is the proof of the evidence that the jews are looking for the paralysis in babylon , after all the years that they sat in babylon , and they were sending that jews to jerusalem .
all these are the cyrus ones that are going to be done .
the most popular cylinder is from the priests of the great , and the great thing about babylon , marduk , written .
they all know what happened .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of people came to tehran .
some knowledge more about the living living , but you &apos;re still thinking that you &apos;re a kind of bad bad .
the new people cried in the first few hours , but their needs were not a lot of time , and they didn &apos;t learn to try and do it , and they were not to get more comfortable in the air , and they were getting more comfortable in the air , like all other .
a study shows that support support of 10 percent of a computer cost costs 10 percent of a computer cost , as a computer , is about 30 percent .
and that fascinated me , because i had spent my whole life in front of a camera .
you know , you know , you know , to find a answer to a answer .
it was the equivalent of people -- most of them and family .
we heard every single one .
but of course he never came . the explanation never happened .
and after many , many meetings , i was thrilled that this man , vannevar , really one of my heroes , really , was made to get to the boat .
so he said , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones who believed in peace and his possibilities , etc . -- and they were actually going to be .
we connect to the world -- i met a lot of the time , and i said , &quot; in london , &quot; in london , it &apos;s about the truce .
it &apos;s about your own , to your business .
the biggest brains of the world should also be cognitively more likely .
i went to the literature of this number , but i could never find them .
there &apos;s just a big brain company .
and amazingly , that &apos;s what our ancestors are doing is that we &apos;ve invented the ones that are going to be invented in a million million years ago than they discovered cooking .
right simple approaches to the most simple conversations that i led .
and i think i &apos;m standing on the beginning .
but once the struggle is the way that the physical rehabilitation was exposed to the physical rehabilitation .
behind him , a child , his son , red in the face of effort , his father .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
i was talking to my boss in the headquarters , and i told them -- i &apos;m going to tell you -- i said , &quot; look , we &apos;re going to start with a few hours every day . &quot;
two groups of the most popular started fighting .
so i asked him , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
&quot; but yes , we need to increase production from feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
and the most important thing , not only in the orthopedic center , but also in the houses of people .
and you should see me during a computer company .
and this hospital could have been able to be able to do it .
why ? because the way that i had taken it , it was banned .
but i learned something more about that , which is that the leaders of the economy -- the managers of the economy , the united states , were very bad decisions that had been brought to the economy .
because i knew that the state of the african continent was important for my children and their children .
i try to get the experience that i had in monaco , to africa .
is my time ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment from a great society in a generation .
you &apos;ll get a little bit of the time that he &apos;s very much like the most powerful ball , the sun we draw as children .
in fact , that &apos;s something that &apos;s about half of you , more than half , not familiar .
32 pills of the act of the act .
and the most important thing . &quot;
and these are the messages you give you ?
because , in the bottom , the funders love it , and so he brings them all into television .
a professional , professional , who talks to dead , they don &apos;t get me ?
what is common ?
we &apos;d like to have suggestions of you , like you &apos;re going to be able to get a little bit of the time , and you &apos;ve been doing the other thing to do , and you &apos;re doing a little bit of the world .
thank you .
so the whole hospital is often going to be over a generator .
it has to give something better . &quot;
but that &apos;s what the user can control whether there &apos;s just electricity or not , because they can control the surface of the basis , how much percent oxygen you give your patient .
but we want to be sure that this is the most effective and the most effective device that we can put in hospitals .
the different species of writing in africa , the first was the first one , as the script is called the script of a secret society in the world &apos;s office .
anyway , when a computer called john , john &apos;s named john &apos;s office in the world &apos;s office , in the world &apos;s office , were working in the north of the world in 1800 , in 1800 , in 1800 , centuries ago .
almost one fifth of all greenhouse gases comes from livestock -- that &apos;s more than traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and the u.s. to the line of the line , and animals at the line of the world , is not just okay .
and the one in french was a in french .
a picture of fish was better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t quite bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question :
some of us would be that maybe that &apos;s not that bad .
about a year ago , i asked myself , &quot; why am i , although i know what i know , no a vegetarian ? &quot;
on the weekend , you have the choice .
you can make a picture with a iphone and all the names , even though it &apos;s still more important .
it &apos;s distracted . he &apos;s going to win the race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would be my , it &apos;s interested in interest , more about it when the the ones are so high , but it &apos;s a very powerful area .
or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a big piece of artwork .
the human nature must change .
but part of the reason -- and that &apos;s why we have a ethical level in the case of the way that they have a ethical level of the way that they are also intrinsic .
it could be more complicated , but maybe not very .
jh : is it to play with these forces ?
and so i knew that i need something to control .
so there &apos;s a lot of time , because it &apos;s a dynamic behavior , because it &apos;s dynamic behavior of liquid .
and so i think that &apos;s what you can be .
this is a great loan in the studio .
we take the pizza , our first pizza , and they put the individual slices , while the messenger is in the hallway and we &apos;re going to be able to get us .
i was sure 20 before i first went into a art museum .
i thought , okay , you &apos;ve got some criteria like you want to pick the works .
it &apos;s not photoshop .
they &apos;re interested in creating alternatives , alternatives , and they needed money for it , so they decided to make some interesting fundraising .
this project is called &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so we went to the grave and made this , it was a little bit of the time that we got .
and she describes how the most important thing -- everything you &apos;re saying is like the most powerful fruit .
he &apos;s a computer company of the native , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it depends with origami . so , go .
people used mathematical principles to the art of the underlying rules to understand the underlying rules .
or they &apos;re going to go to the top and make 50 stars on a flag with 13 stripes .
how would you make a single flap ?
we &apos;ve found these rules with that you put circles , you covered the most powerful with lines that obey the extra rules . that makes the crease pattern .
you can do lots of things .
but if you want to do it bigger , you could need something origami .
and that doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re in space or whether you go into a body .
i grew up in a state of washington in the state of washington with a lot of time .
we only have three minutes . but we &apos;re talking about hours of hours .
and so i want to talk about that because if we don &apos;t recognize it , this transformation will be very painful .
and in a moment , i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;re going to see in the graph -- it starts in 1973 , just before women start to do the labor market , and it goes on to the day today .
you gave instructions from top .
because i write about all this book , i still , and i don &apos;t have a answer to that .
and that was very daunting for them .
and we haven &apos;t completely been able to have this information , come back to us in the form of culture , in this strange and a little bit of the way you can see that the sensitivity are changing .
there &apos;s no man or no woman who &apos;s in the middle and it &apos;s , the wires .
and the personal income on a scale that was constantly held to consider inflation , in this time , more than doubled , almost tripled .
and to hear me , and to understand what i say , you need about 60 bits per second .
and it &apos;s going to be , so in the last book of mine called &quot; good business , &quot; i interviewed some ceo that are very successful by their environment as a very successful and very ethical , with great social sense .
control is always a safe thing , because you &apos;re going to feel in your , but not very comforting .
&quot; where are you born , grew up and went to school ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they had their own meaning for what &apos;s home . they had their significance for community , and even for hostility , which was going to be able to be able to go out of birth . they didn &apos;t really have the possibility to go beyond .
more and more people are also in the future or present , as in the past .
i went down in the room where i should sleep .
so , the most important thing is , where is you home ?
there was a big gap between one billion in the industrialized countries and the two billion in the developing world .
but that &apos;s the world we have today . no gap .
and let me show you why , by the time , digital technology .
the kids are the new green .
and again , they were better than we , &quot; you and your library , &quot; your brits and your mortality rate in heart disease . &quot;
but if you &apos;re people , you don &apos;t change the high number of heart disease .
and i immediately started working with a lot of time , and i was growing , and then i worked with a lot of time -- mice that couldn &apos;t produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my mother , and of course , i don &apos;t know how old she is .
you could be equally good at the equator .
certainly many progress , many of the lives , many of the lives .
this is actually real photography , in time , that &apos;s the limb within less days .
and here you see what &apos;s going on six months later , which is technically the very technically the way that it &apos;s going to be the very technically .
a blood blood is two different cell cell .
we &apos;re asking it to this oven-like device .
much more complex organs . with distance , the most complex solid organs are the high ones , with every amount of blood organs , and the amount of blood organs , liver and kidneys .
this is still in the most violent .
we prefer cells that are not going to be fooled and not to make tumors .
we only need five seconds .
for every problem out there , anybody would have an idea .
so , i &apos;m just something in panic -- unlike all the visual and sugar , which i had -- but this is really a entrepreneur .
that doesn &apos;t mean you have to visit a more powerful .
i went from door to door and sold a license .
it &apos;s like a recession . so , there &apos;s a recession .
and you would do these chairs .
this is useless . &quot; you have to get a way to get faster money .
i sold a lot of the kind of conceptual .
they don &apos;t get a regular income , but they have the opportunity to find more tasks and learn them , the ability to be the ability to find more possibilities .
if you go into a restaurant and you &apos;re going to be bad , you show them how bad personal practice looks like .
these young , the humanities .
the development of today &apos;s students is all the interests , except to throw a board on the board .
the most important thing about the computer of the world or a more powerful thing to the cultural health system is moving to the most of our students .
the values of the past will also be assumed . it brings every amount of society .
but it &apos;s a politics of principles , not the most important .
they have a mind . and they have other people .
what we should do when we think about conservatives -- except that case of the 1980s -- what &apos;s going on is that it &apos;s : you go to church .
yeah , i know you don &apos;t really believe that .
and that doesn &apos;t just lead to another result , it has the potential to change how we deal with each other .
completely different .
actually , it &apos;s not a right organization , but clear -- let me conclude -- make a creative commons , a simple way to make the authors with the freedoms , which you want to leave with them .
john turing .
and i wonder how often something happened .
he told me that he was the most popular and then said , &quot; there &apos;s a snake in the next room , and we &apos;re going to be there now . &quot;
so , for today , i had the idea that i run them through this process and show them how these journey looks .
and the hospital and general electric was also happy .
i was going to be able to understand it right now .
i &apos;m going to ask people , &quot; is it really possible to use these microbial ecosystems to our advantage ? &quot;
another way of finding microbes is spread through the people . architects are like to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
imagine a design that takes microbes to take the microbes , for example , or on a phone .
and nobody knew about it .
my company , the company , built a system called the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the apple macintosh . &quot;
in 1992 , his essay was rejected by the most popular .
and greenpeace wanted to do this , and a method that you wanted to do with that was one of these whales , one of these whales .
at 78 percent of the voices . to give you an idea of the most powerful victory : in the most important , two percent of the world &apos;s only three percent .
and the last message i want to tell you is , you can be very successful online .
i think i don &apos;t need to explain what a big privilege is to stand in front of them today .
this is the school that was built with the community .
something that we have in gando are the most powerful .
just like this .
good morning . magic is a great way to predict the most important , to be able to make the way that science is really going to be able to do what science is really going to be .
there &apos;s the color red and color black , they &apos;re for the more subtle shift of day .
voice : why not ? this is a very good piece .
this is an illusion .
so that &apos;s china , a hare , and not so much a nation-state .
but you can &apos;t lead a country like china , a very reactive , on the basis of a civilization , a system .
and the reason that is , first , the state in china gets a very special -- enjoy a very special value than the representative , the embodiment and the the of chinese civilization , the heart of chinese civilization .
he was in 1999 long , interconnected beijing with a lot of time and shanghai .
we &apos;ve seen this in terms of the most difficult -- the position of the most rapidly -- or the bitter .
he goes on a street in the pharmacy , and the cars drive below .
red , the drums of blue blue , plus the green orange , is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a time .
and the first song was on english , the second one was on chinese .
she agreed her song .
i made graffiti , i wrote my name everywhere , used the city as a canvas .
i mean , these were the faces of my friends .
they all have accepted that their image would be given to the other .
&quot; you mean , you &apos;re going to be a face of a face -- that &apos;s a face , right here ? &quot;
most places i went to go to , i decided to go to the media .
i took more photos and we launched the project .
are you a liar ? are you from the media ? &quot;
so the roofs were paid , a woman , &quot; now , &quot; now i can see god . &quot;
because this is a big part of it . there &apos;s layers behind each photograph .
but they basically have a promise of me .
or , &quot; how can we help . &quot;
if i think about the sensory and about what they &apos;re driving , why it &apos;s happening now , i think there are some factors that i want to give you as a computer .
they have an trend .
zipcar started a decade earlier , in 2000 .
it challenges to participation . cities have been welcome to participation , and they &apos;ve been welcome to participation .
it &apos;s very inexpensive , and it &apos;s very cheaply .
the last 40 years were extraordinary times .
and also miniaturization .
that would produce a significant kind of thing .
it &apos;s vital that at ted , ideas , ideas that we think about , and make sure that this is a particularly great century , and not one of the most amazing and a half of the time .
my left family are boring academics who are dealing with that , to collect the most important of the world &apos;s disease .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet the prime minister . &quot;
i thought he would be crazy , but something really was going to be .
i was sitting in the audience , in the audience .
this is another picture .
since then , netra has been brought to me , and i &apos;ve been doing a lot of success .
i started exploring the most popular of human psyche .
so i said , let &apos;s try something else .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much better . einstein is very honored to be here at ted 2006 between all the einstein &apos;s einstein &apos;s office . actually it &apos;s very excited .
it would be very dangerous if you would fall off .
sw : no , i don &apos;t have a problem . you have the problem , remember you ?
sw : big final .
sw : what about a computer ?
my parents found this important for their inner quiet .
if i have a talent , it &apos;s things to take apart that i have to be able to do .
the body has a higher density than the water . at least 95 percent of the body comes from itself .
and this will get it very far .
i asked him what this means .
and that point , you can imagine if you want to be able to get several languages and you can take it without that you affect each other .
and she looked up to me and said , &quot; well , this is better . &quot;
i think they &apos;re going to be very good to look at me .
and have a test of a test with 50,000 students , and they &apos;ve built about half a dozen schools , my readers , by the way .
we found out -- and we were very much wrong with it , and then they were going to be able to do it -- but we found that the young people loved it .
diane : a little introduction in the world &apos;s most powerful
and finally , the only person who &apos;s going to go forward , a young shepherd , and he goes to saul and says , &quot; i &apos;m going to fight it against him . &quot;
there &apos;s the cavalry , men on horses and with a little bit of the time .
goliath is light prey . he doesn &apos;t have a chance .
so goliath is about a very bigger than the time , and normally there &apos;s a explanation for that if someone is so far outside the norm .
and i think that &apos;s a very important lesson for us all .
and it turns out we &apos;re covered by a computer , and these microbes are mostly doing good , rather than killing us .
they all have the microbes and then they used the little the receiver .
most pills , or the most powerful , you can eat , or two , maybe five species , and the human community has thousands of species of species .
we need a more powerful for microbes that live in and live in people so we can understand what they &apos;re doing .
very many people think about the internet , very much on the internet , but for us , it &apos;s really global . we &apos;re in many , many languages .
when you saw it a ridiculous change on the side of me , you thought that it would probably be in the hippocampus of it .
it &apos;s a social concept of cooperation , so we don &apos;t talk much about truth and objectivity .
and we have 40 of the things that we have 40 , 40 .
it &apos;s not a perfect rule but it &apos;s enough for the beginning .
and i always like you to say that you &apos;re also the only person who &apos;s actually all the rules of wikipedia .
it seems to me when most textbooks are using the education of our children , from nature from irregular .
in the jungle of guatemala , in the jungle , a temple is a temple .
not a well-known indian indian indian in the year of the year , and it &apos;s a year of a year .
it &apos;s far under your cognitive health system .
we found activity in other areas , in brain regions that are associated with computation and loss .
i have a friend that &apos;s just a terrible .
and i said , i don &apos;t know .
we &apos;re turning each other to each other , and we &apos;re going to take our appearance &quot; and we &apos;re talking . &quot;
tools like the way to be a little bit of the way , knives , and the other thing i had in a towel .
i had looked for a wide and wide , but i had never looked at it near .
in some of the most sophisticated , they put tools , about 24,000 to the most important .
so dolphins can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
look at how they synchronize with their partner and the other .
but we found that free dolphins don &apos;t just depend on a boat on a keyboard .
and we called this dolphin , &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; you know , &quot; you know , &quot; you know , &quot; about 12 of the years .
but while we were experimenting with their natural sounds , we also plan to get this back to the computer system .
and the word is invented .
there &apos;s yves rossy .
and especially if you &apos;re in the most violent , you have the feeling to fly .
yr : i &apos;m just trying to be just just to be .
i may have used 20 times 20 times -- never with this kind of wing , but at the beginning .
we don &apos;t say that , we don &apos;t .
but it was up to the top and full of plywood .
and imagine , the way that you saw what you saw is to explain by invisible powers .
because this event was the scientific revolution since our knowledge of the physical world , and how we can adapt to our needs , and we can actually be able to be able to be able to grow out .
by the way , why don &apos;t we do that ?
your is based on assumptions ; our on the bible . &quot;
there &apos;s something like a computer story .
and only if a explanation is good , it &apos;s important to check them .
glasses are not very expensive . they &apos;re pretty upset .
it &apos;s about 30,000 of you .
what is minto for a place ?
the new festival challenges the audience , a critical role in design of the performance of performance .

i &apos;m going to show you images today from the images of the world , and i &apos;m going to show you the images and the polar bear and seals and leopard seals , but this picture is going to show me more than any other one i &apos;ve ever done .
people said , &quot; we knew they &apos;re a pilgrimage . we knew it . &quot;
and this seal took the penguin to the head and he woke up and forth .
she swam away , started a penguin .
she tried my camera , which is the dream of one of the photographers .
paul : stories from a computer of a plastic
now , open your eyes .
do you have a ring ?

joe , we &apos;re doing this so long until they &apos;re going to get it out .
funny , yeah , we have a little man , a little bit of a man , a lot of day , the whole day up there .
as i said , they form their reality .
first of all , we worked together , ushahidi and develop .
a call in the united states , after canada or china costs five , or a hundred of the dollars , or a million dollars .
it &apos;s built , so you can also join a more powerful and so on remote places .
and the time , the buildings were higher and bigger our technology always better , so that the mechanical systems were enormous . they need big amounts of energy .
imagine two americans together through italy .
please raise all the time as liberal .
the best definition of the &quot; i know -- you explain so much -- is it so much -- comes from the kind of a little bit of the toy &apos;s gary marcus .
he &apos;s very , very old boxes .
but look at the other three lines of the other .
are that not just the foundation of the surface and the surface of the world and the most powerful ?
she went up and kept on .
and they say , &quot; hold your laws from my body . &quot;
and we have the signs of the right to the right , the liberals , the liberals , and both work together .
and so the answer is , i think , this passion to use the truth to the truth and try to turn them into a better future for all of us .
but if you react , a lot of other people in the environment are innocent , but also hurt -- the military wants to be not like to talk about the damage .
we look at something else , &quot; and apparently , the situations are really comparable to the situations .
is anybody a commandment , how often if you think about how much , how often did the police be in queensland at the time ?
there was only a few people who were shot at this incident .
it &apos;s 72 and it looks like this is the kind of thing that &apos;s going to deal with her .

we started organizing makers in our maker , &quot; maker fair . &quot;
and the more important , more sophisticated billy , or something like this .
and i &apos;ll tell you more about it , but just ...
but he also moved to other people who were doing the same as he did .
this is &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and we need to bring this into schools , or in the communities , many ways -- the ability to make us form the world to form us and form new .
there &apos;s the glamour of physics .
and in fact , we see these kinds of pictures of stars that are all the time -- you call it a little bit of the time .
it doesn &apos;t look about one way , but you have to imagine your world .
stairs that are a wind winds , are glamorous .
but it &apos;s always going to give you the illusion that if you buy this lamp , you &apos;re going to live in a world without wires .
the perfect thing -- it &apos;s the perfect chain , with the perfect chain , with the perfect .

my friend was doing this big bowl and i asked them , &quot; what is this ? &quot;
it was for me to be friends and a loving sister .

children need a long time to do it until they call the system .
rs : whoa . now , joshua goes to get something to get to make something .
rs : should ivan get trouble now ?

but why do you have to feel something like this ?
and it was , you know , you know , a class for a day .
and second , is it possible , or at all , to get slower ?
they want to go back to a slow rhythm .
and norway , sweden , denmark and finland are under six of the world &apos;s world , and work in the world , and they work in the average american , who would cry in the average american .
but the new idea that &apos;s the revolutionary idea of the most important thing is that there &apos;s something like &quot; good slow . &quot;
i &apos;m stuck with the world &apos;s favorite task , and i was a job of the task of my favorite task , and it &apos;s a lot of me , because they were so slow and i wanted to be done .
and so everything took his beginning , and they said , &quot; you can &apos;t build everything on a island ; a part of it must stay on the bank because we don &apos;t want to go from the community . &quot;
i worked in months and i didn &apos;t get to deal with that because i felt that people who came from the historical museum , already with information , is full of information . if you see a museum with information , you wouldn &apos;t process it anymore .
when i flew back home , the most popular thing was planned .
but you see the implication of the environment .

so in jazz , the most amazing thing is absolutely amazing .
it &apos;s not about my vision , or something like this .

in summer , india is going to be extremely hot .
and the adult animal , that &apos;s going to happen , another one or two months .
i didn &apos;t know that , but i know it today . that &apos;s hundreds of species .
this was a little curious , and i &apos;m going to hear this , because i want to ask you , and here &apos;s a lot of people who -- from india , of course , people who spent their childhood here .
so , next , i was going to the phone .

a pretty incredible thing .
incredible . this is the most important one of the most important thing to do . a pretty incredible journey .
i made this from my life .
and everybody thought i would be good , but on the new terrain , i was terrible . people said , &quot; oh , he &apos;s -- oh , what &apos;s happening with a se ? &quot;
in the night i looked at my surgery , and i asked myself , &quot; how do i do that ? &quot;
next -- oh , attention . these guys are the community .

the sahara was much bigger than today .
people who are going to kill the animals that they were going to be able to get into the world &apos;s most violent , moved to north and followed by a million years ago , and they followed the grasslands in the middle east in the middle east .
the main genome , the most popular thing on mars .
we know deep in our hearts that the universe doesn &apos;t move from mush to complexity .
so , there &apos;s a lot of time .
what you see here , the blue areas are about a $ ambitious degree of light than the red areas .
and over smaller distances than gravity works , what explains why they are and i are smaller than the stars and planets .
they &apos;re familiar with the double of dna .
let me explain why .
in the last 200 years , something else happened .
maybe you ask yourself , &quot; what &apos;s talking about ? &quot;
we &apos;re not so good when it &apos;s about insurance insurance .
and then you have to decide how you invest in your 52 choices , and you never heard about a computer of a computer .
at least a wonderful study has predicted .
but if you get the driver &apos;s license , you &apos;re going to cross the box , if you don &apos;t want to donate the organs .
the other group gets two apples , one will taken .
save more tomorrow , it just makes it .
this is just an example .
it &apos;s a song about a so-called so-called a so-called a creature , a creature that &apos;s estimated a creature that &apos;s a creature .
hello , who is because , please ?
thank you .
and that &apos;s what we know too much influence on life .
i &apos;m trying to get time to get time .
so what did i do ?
we invent stories to explain our existence .
so what did they do ? they sent her walter to the other part of their divine part of their divine part .
so , you know , a child ?
elizabeth : get out ! come out ! come out ! come out !
i went to a friend of mine , and he was waiting for me to go in his apartment in the center of the center in the 20th floor , a really rich area in mumbai .
everything is a contradiction .
we &apos;ve lived from less than a dollar on a day -- about 15 years .
and you have to use nuts from the rainforests to show that forests are more worth than the forests of the world . &quot;
he said , &quot; you can &apos;t wake up a person who says to sleep . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about people ; it &apos;s about lifestyle .
if all of the time , all of the time , all of the time , should be sustainable , how can we achieve this ?
coke has to work with pepsi .
these are nine of them .
at the end , we had , i think , 60 percent of the world &apos;s population , and 25 percent of the world &apos;s population .
this is not irrelevant .
but they don &apos;t just buy the juice ; they also buy carbon in the trees to be able to be able to be able to get the carbon &apos;s water to the body , which is the product of the product .
so the communication is interrupted between brain and spinal cord , and it leads to a full and permanent paralysis of the leg .
after some years , it &apos;s been done to develop a coherent , a coherent , which is the nervous system of the spinal cord of a sleeping state .
we worked hard for 10 years to achieve this goal .
after a few weeks , we put a programmable pump , and we &apos;re going to be a reasonable pump to inject a individual .
and i was a kid of the class of the class .
he talked about the world , like she &apos;s &quot; and the world , how you should be . &quot;
and by doing that , these women are a lot of obstacles from the way .
in the white house , and the desk he sits on , &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last day , the woman who was doing everything , and we talked about each other , and suddenly she said to me , &quot; would you sing me ? &quot;
for this , this is a computer company to the voice , because it &apos;s mysterious -- like you can see -- it &apos;s completely spontaneously , and it &apos;s originally .
they didn &apos;t have anything .
so the internet needs the internet and instructions .
one of the most popular websites of the world , which is run by the most powerful company , and there was nothing , which could have youtube or google about it .
and today wikipedia is so so so compelling that you can actually find them on the cards of restaurants in china .
and that has a wikipedia .
this is a blog that &apos;s a blog that &apos;s going to be a little bit of a computer .
why ? there &apos;s a more powerful thing in the world .
the world ended up in the 90s .
and we see that the impact of the ecosystem on the world &apos;s brain is very , very strong .
all this costs money .
and it was done a lot to get students with a lot of money or socially weak families .
how are schools going to be shown and teachers in the media ?
in bureaucratic systems , teachers are going to be left in the classes alone and have a lot of the most powerful .
some people claim that the change of the most powerful thing is that the change of the most powerful thing is a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a .
but if you look at the issue of this perspective , you see what happened in the last 60 years .
and i went to the whole morning about 15 miles to get the most important .
so that was obviously a kind of a device .
we could also do that with phones .
so a business is going to be a business for you .
&quot; the government needs to offer economically services . &quot;
it was once , long , long time , when i was 24 years old , i studied at the time of st. college in bangalore .
and you can see my card when i &apos;m going to get them up here .
and i also bring a invention with a invention .
now we &apos;re in the 1930s , and you see japan is going through a time of war , with lower life expectancy .
and they decided to invest in health and education , but also to be able to grow the economy .
washington , d.c. went out .
not the bubble , not my bubbles , but the financial bubble .
will the one completely changed a completely changed world economy , and the transition transition of there , where they were in the last 50 to 100 years after asia , and after the last 50 to 150 years after asia ?
the rest of the diagram is a very mysterious substance called dark energy .
but that explains the presence of all mass .
and now they &apos;re going to pay attention to the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe -- a three-dimensional space .
again , this is a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a model of what &apos;s going on during the most violent .
they move from each other because the space is bigger .
by looking at things like galaxies -- their favorite , as many of them are , as a function of time , we can bring it into experience , which is the dark matter and dark energy in the competition to form structures .
the big questions in physics .
thank you a banjo boys : the world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world -- new jersey ?
so , recycling and recycling are a little bit of the way .
marc : 1.3 million reasons , the most important thing to reinvent
and in fact , there were this change in gay men in the united states during the 1980s .
it &apos;s a disease that kills a lot of adults in africa , and also many children .
in uganda , we see that the prevalence of the prevalence .
it &apos;s going to close very similar to the very similar .
but openness and connection has a price when we think about diseases . that should not be surprise .
coffee is uganda .
emily &apos;s still studied the aids of the statistics in africa , and it comes to a surprising consequence : all our knowledge about the spread of hiv on the continent is wrong .
but i was fascinated by it because i watched this kind of a italian italian .
he was called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; , &quot; because he was the front of the front , but every time he was going to go in a tunnel , he built a little bit of a little bit of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind
these transactions are going to be on the water like a magnet .
then we ask ourselves why the membrane is being distracted and why it takes so much electricity .
for example , in the most violent of the world &apos;s disease in a material .
in the world , i &apos;m working on the most powerful , and i work with the most important architect , and we &apos;re working with the most powerful architect .
janine benyus : biomimicry in the use
&quot; yes , but why ? &quot;
we were four , not a , and fortunately not a young boy .
you can &apos;t do anything about it .
it &apos;s never going to happen in india , because it was now and never again .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s pray . &quot;
this was a kind of a little bit of a million inmates in this prison .
second , it &apos;s about the most important movement in india .
so let me tell you about a project that we did some years later , a kind of a piece of captcha .
and basically , you &apos;re going to start by a old book .
the number of pages that are actually using the thylacines is that the number of words we digitize a day is very large .
some are more funny .
the web is split in several languages .
then my favorite question comes .
there &apos;s a way to beat two flies with a dry .
but what might be surprising is that the translations we get from the most powerful , even if you &apos;re just at the end of the , the translations we &apos;re going to get , as the professional of professional , and that &apos;s very surprising .
there are people who are learning to be worth , they don &apos;t have to pay money with their time .
the most connected side , the company , makes what you really can do .
and the active participation is to build all other than normal .
and zipcar offers a very mild , a very powerful service , the fabulous .
for aristotle , happiness was the highest good , the goal to all of the other .
maybe these people are right . his thoughts , is maybe not good .
10 percent of the time , the thoughts of the time -- -- -- at sex .
i played the violent african , the african terrorists .
well , from the first of the first , no more of the world &apos;s favorite , and it was no more likely to get the majority -- so the elections were going to be in a second round of three weeks later .
now here &apos;s an interesting comparison .
so i moved to la jolla , and i &apos;ve learned surfing .
people in the 17th century didn &apos;t really know how we do that stuff is a bunch of different molecules , and that we &apos;re going to breathe out of a certain reason and so .
and so , charles , i &apos;m going to put money on the way to give you a building , and you can meet you , but you don &apos;t talk about religion .
reality is what you can see .
i thought everybody with a little mind would do that .
just to see what would happen when you mix the two .
so i have something that &apos;s not personally .
if you want to get rich today , entrepreneurs will be .
they say , if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , it doesn &apos;t go up -- it doesn &apos;t go up at all . we &apos;re measuring it for 20 years , and it &apos;s not going to be very carefully .
namaste kary mullis talks about the basis of modern science : the experiment . he tells stories from the 17th century and the curiosity , and the curiosity , inspiration and care of good science in all their shapes .
i wanted to represent a very different body , which is that these are the most powerful , the most powerful spaces .
&quot; naked city &quot; is a nickname for new york and &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; of the &quot; in a urban environment . &quot;
i love traveling , and berlin is one of my favorite favorite .
and the whole time i didn &apos;t see a single rat at some of these places until recently , when i was in the london .
the first question is , and maybe they write them , either on a sheet of paper , physically , or on a virtual sheet in their head , and , for audience , they can try to try and try it : they can try to try and try it .
and we &apos;re going to break with , &quot; we &apos;re the best scientific school of the world , &quot; because of our british hubris .
except , that -- you &apos;re in the way -- well , in your brainwaves , you thought , &quot; hmm , what happens during the night ? &quot;
and one of the most difficult problems is , if people have a notion of how everything works , it &apos;s pretty difficult to change this .
and as an expert for a slave , i have friends and colleagues who differ between the organic , living world and the inorganic , the world .
and you can see , he &apos;s going to get rid of it , and it &apos;s growing in a way .
we even have amazing life forms that we can manipulate .
and darwin himself asked a colleague to a colleague that life was probably done somewhere in a warm small pond -- maybe not in scotland , maybe in africa , maybe somewhere else .
what is life ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can connect them and literally thousands and thousands of really large molecules , in the same size like dna and proteins , but it &apos;s not carbon in view .
we want to put them in the environment and we want them to get their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can make a slave biology , and to get matter to connect , then it &apos;s actually estimated in fact .
but there &apos;s another reason why i like this business business : every single one is going to measure .
and these are high professional wright , who sit in a woman , and they &apos;re asking to their favorite question .
i was really sitting at friday , and i could see how the mortality mortality of the morning fell on 84 .
as you know , these economists love the money , they want more and more of it .
as you can see , it doesn &apos;t make sense of a improvement , which is not a improvement , which is not a very fast progress .
but you don &apos;t talk about it so much .
in which there were high , or very high child mortality , child mortality and the families were also very large , six to eight .
here &apos;s also the way .
what &apos;s still worth is worth money .
yeah , i went barefoot , until i was 12 .
and he told them , &quot; imagine the most important thing .
the whole time was a border .
and the world &apos;s , after my opinion , the world will get forward , will make a difference , not just for some few , but for every one .
... above the knee , yes , that would be difficult ...
the most important thing -- it needed about 10 years and 700 million dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth is enough to satisfy everybody needs , but not everybody greed .
and babies die .
i went to high school .
when i was at the council of scientific industry research -- 40 laboratories -- if two of the things that were not talking to each other , i built teams .
they were made and now i have apps in the app .
it &apos;s about perfect , and something old to lead to the 21st century .
it &apos;s still very hot , but not more of the way .
but this reactor isn &apos;t under high pressure , and it &apos;s not so unhealthy , that is that the most important thing is , the reactor is not to leave the reactor .
i &apos;m convinced that the reactor i designed here is a innovative source of energy that &apos;s going to be great scientific projects with electricity and i &apos;m really ready to do this .
we &apos;re moving to a health system where the experience is the actual product .
there &apos;s a manufacturer of the most important thing to do for the case that they &apos;re going to go in the forest .
at the end of a long lonely good advice that he &apos;s going to be his son , he says , &quot; especially , &quot; especially , is the way that you &apos;re , &quot; especially , &quot; is the way that you &apos;re , &quot; about yourself , &quot; you know , it &apos;s about yourself .
you don &apos;t usually go to los angeles , but there &apos;s a place where you can walk a lot of time out in this city , outside in this city .
then they &apos;re going to be wrong as a wrong , as a little bit of the time , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to do that .
when i was small , i was very compact and stayed for me alone .
then it was just about starting to start and build it until the end .
so i built it out of concrete , because it doesn &apos;t matter .
this was this tool .
and for me , this is the most important thing . because i was a kid , i wanted to convey my passion and love .
25 days : the waiter developed 32 days : poor and hands are going to develop 36 days : the primitive spine starts to train these weeks , in which the fetus is developed in the fastest .
the complexity , this is a single system , again , beyond every understanding or any today today .
because apparently , there &apos;s this constant system of the world &apos;s atmosphere , not in the atmosphere of the federal stars .
so what can you do with these spectra ?
recently , a colleague sent me a colleague from berkeley , a email with a very interesting spectrum and asked , &quot; can you look at this ? &quot;
there are two ways -- about the most important and the stars , and the matter of the world , and chemical elements in the universe , and they &apos;re going to be made .
because you can imagine that everything is going to be ?
now imagine a object , an incredible object , or something that we can &apos;t explain and we &apos;re just on and say , &quot; so , let &apos;s go . physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
and if we see the way we see , and oxygen , i think , we have the perfect e.t. .
i just said , &quot; really ? &quot; and he said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what i can tell you about is it &apos;s universal ; we all have them .
i &apos;m slightly hooked for a little bit of a bit of a bit of a talk , but that &apos;s another talk .
this led to a little breakdown -- -- that &apos;s actually the same thing that looked like .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is : no more , no more , no more , no more , no more . &quot;
what are you going to be vulnerable to ? &quot;
i have right , you don &apos;t have right . wait .
we do that as if what we do , no impact on other people .
people are going to be their meals in twitter who &apos;s the more of their children on the iphone .
so if we think about it , they &apos;re going to make systematic improvements , and we also think about how they can be useful to our own , for our own , and we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to do it .
and today i want to talk about one of the things that we decided to do at that time , and we wanted to find a new access to health care .
so steven shares his story . but he &apos;s not alone .
here , why people pray .
i love this kind of thing , and that &apos;s the only thing that was online , and that was the only ones online .
and here we have a paper .
you don &apos;t have any more sophisticated , you don &apos;t have data , that doesn &apos;t go to scientific methods .
this is the curve about the most powerful .
but my brother didn &apos;t , with him .
if we went from here to the most important , we would be able to get to something that 300 feet tall , 28 miles wide , 28 miles wide , and the two commandments weighs .
to change the state , you just need two volts of a computer .
we said , &quot; can you build this ? &quot;
we can do better .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that &apos;s from the so-called the so-called .
and the way is networks of the ideals of complex systems .
and it also has implications on the benefits of risk .
so we could put a more of the most imaginative one .
we see the emergence of the world , and we &apos;re looking at the programs that focus on that , our connected world from the perspective of complexity .
and a more powerful capacity of the capacity of the capacity of the brain -- except you use expensive pumps and valves .
and we had 500 of these kinds of things prepared .
without human rights .
so we were up on our top of our own .
and this graph doesn &apos;t even mean something that is invented data .
and my brain starts thinking very quickly that this is a kind of a bit of a problem of negative to positive in the world .
because this question is going to predict that our external world can predict our own way , but the truth is that i can only predict 10 percent of the world &apos;s disease if i can make your entire external world .
and that &apos;s from two reasons , and wrong .
we &apos;re moving people when they open their own , a positive email of the computer , or the most powerful to someone in their social environment .
hard to say -- a more powerful , you understand -- my father was the most popular man on the world .
and so i went . i went to mit , and i went to mit .
they said , do it .
they take a huge disk from cardboard .
he was the first digital media in tokyo .
listen ? how cows ? this is 4 o &apos;clock in inorganic .
so there are all these things to do , but most love i &apos;m doing to taste the world .
and i was going to be able to do this with passion .
their culture is not coming in schools . and i want to introduce you to how we can overcome this problem .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s so nervous because girls want to go to schools , where there are no boys .
and over small moments in my life .
or mothers who have raised boys ?
we need to change the posture of young in elementary school .
and you have the impression that you believe that it would be okay .
let &apos;s see where this hypothesis is going to be .
is that a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we believe that this is why &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
i &apos;m going to try and do that , and i &apos;m also excited , and i &apos;m also excited if it works .
and that was really a important lesson for me that you can &apos;t really affect a object .
so , for example , we created a newspaper , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s connected to radio with my ipad , and that &apos;s a software that goes on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a computer company , so i added them to a computer , so that people are responding to the glass , so they &apos;re going to respond to them .
i &apos;m going to turn in a man in a man , and then in a old man , and then in a old man .
and in the other way , we have been allowed .
radio : what do you think ?
fold the wings together and drive them on .
so i &apos;m going to show you another question :
and he took a royal , and he was making a royal , and they had a instruction , and night , and night , and at night , it doesn &apos;t really have to be good to be good .
because they found that the human behavior is stronger .
yet , we have to create a clear thing , which is what you can create , which is what you can create from value . and it &apos;s also much fair .
now , if we all have these tools to have , we have to just ask the question -- and acumen and the other , and we &apos;ve done this -- how we use these smart ones .
they &apos;re going to lead the new world &apos;s new .
they give little , more powerful , the most powerful .
i felt passion , soul and heart , my body .
audience : no .
sb : no , not &quot; without &quot; without &quot; no . &quot;
all around us , the other replicator is going to find a different replicator in this kind of culture of culture .
they probably bought them .
imagine the world full of brains and more memes than a place for them .
we are the only ones , and we &apos;re the only ones .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
that was dangerous , but hello .
they use us to make the resource of the planet to make more and more computers , and more amazing things that we hear here at ted .
and will we go through this third danger , how do we have the second and first one ?
in collaboration with a lot of time -- that &apos;s the most powerful in haiti -- with the ministry of public health , with various , different , and we &apos;re more than 1,500 buildings .
it &apos;s not going to cost us anymore if we do it right . &quot;
and because i had burning 70 percent of my body , the whole thing was about an hour .
we also found that it would have been good , you &apos;d have given me off to recover from the pain .
and how bad would the punishment be , if i was caught ?
it wasn &apos;t that the most important people -- the ones that have more commandments -- less drake , and that the less religious -- the ones who could &apos;t remember almost a commandments -- more cheated .
so if you don &apos;t think of a few seconds , because you &apos;re going to get a brand , you make a difference ?
because it &apos;s like this :
i think all these forces have very bad effects on the stock market .
but you can believe me . i work in the commercial commercial .
these are the most powerful ones i can show you today .
and suddenly amazon will be the brand , and it &apos;s going to be defined with the beaches , defined how they want to spend money , what &apos;s money and what it is .
maybe that seems to be a big leap ?
and i don &apos;t have to explain it to the audience , and i don &apos;t have to explain to my favorite -- i had to explain it to my favorite -- skeletons , the sperm of a individual to another .
and i knew that animals like the most important one , or even most animals don &apos;t stabilize their tissue by carrying them across bones .
and that was that every skeleton we found to the world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s most common , the same thing we had .
all i showed that was really surprised about it .
a funny song about global warming , by jill haring .
well , i have to do it now .
all right , ok .
do we want a piece of play ?
and the most powerful , and the more powerful , and the benefits of a great education .
the most powerful thing about it is completely from about it , and ben became a more powerful .
go on , what is the area of this character ?
i was forced to leave my home , the democratic republic of congo , where i was a lot of time .
but remarkably has estimated the united nations of the united nations in the country on 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not at the goal .
they have to be very inexpensive to be available .
but could not be done for this angle of the market market ?
they were asking by governments to be able to get them , and they have them .
but let &apos;s take our goal to the way that we &apos;re going to take new economic action to the basis of the pyramid .
because they needed a whole bunch of these little transactions to make their profits .
he liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to be in his own bed .
since the world &apos;s office , when sir was a little bit of the british society , and the british society for the u.k.
so what is fusion ? here &apos;s something called a little bit more .
and this energy is that the fusion is going to go .
so , about a lot of energy , like conventional power .
we need to make it a power station .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country and is also a great impact .
it was most of the democracy , but they were all the countries who had the population in the last month , their opinion in the last month , and they had only four percent .
but the expectations of people were important to their future .
so the question is to be , &quot; what does the male support for women &apos;s support ? &quot;
i promise you , she read the message .
nobody can listen to them , they just send a text .
you could see the immediate effects of laws or the one of the most powerful talks on a computer , and see what happens as a consequence .
the flight took 12 seconds and went over 35 .
this is unnatural for a rocket .
he weighs less than a computer .
from the smallest forces of the storms of nature .
we can afford to be able to give up as individuals and we &apos;re hearing hearing .
we believe that somebody else , somebody else , somebody &apos;s , somebody &apos;s going to solve that problem , will solve this problem .
we didn &apos;t flew him in the pacific .
it took 10 full prototypes until we had something that was really flown .
and so there &apos;s this incredible overwhelming , which is what &apos;s possible , and that enormous serious thing that means .
and we think about our moral .
and the director was pretty charming and said , he was looking for me for crazy . and he said to me , &quot; this place is a gathering . &quot;
it took several such events , until i found what i should do .
when i started with this program four years ago , my favorite plan was a design of the world &apos;s plan .
and you look down to the street , everything is so small and tiny .
i feel blessed , and happy , i had the courage for 15 years ago , and i had to give up my post in the pub , and i &apos;m going to go back to my country , where i can do this incredible rides with this group of ethiopia , morocco and russia .
and how often would my self die before i would understand that it &apos;s not been there from beginning ?
and i was a really good dancer .
so , marc , these insights don &apos;t mean my low self-esteem , this feeling of otherness .
that was because i had no self , what was between .
imagine what kind of existence we could have when we honor the inevitable death of self , the privilege of life , and the very , as next .
and this is a cafe on the sea in britain .
but instead of looking at this , we focused on how .
we also discovered that as a design structure and a kind of a kind of a kind of a structure of this structure , it would get to be .
but we found that seeds -- this really important project , is that , even instead of -- but that seeds -- in the leading alliance , are not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
we worked with a computer company to develop a computer of the seed , so that if you &apos;re visually visually , it &apos;s kind of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the landscape that you see here .
it &apos;s actually the first few of the things that you &apos;re looking at , and the rest is only for postcards .
the book carries the title &quot; the blank slate , &quot; the popular notion of the popular notion , that the human mind is a blank slate and all his structure of his alibi , culture , education and experience .
well , there &apos;s a series of political reasons that they like to do good .
it &apos;s still not clear whether these transactions are wiped out , but then the most powerful thing seemed to be the most important thing to support .
another one of the humanities and the universities in the universities , in the universities , are actually in a decline .
well , the other hot iron is the parenting .
and i think you can &apos;t say that better .
i also call a ph.d. , just like this , and it doesn &apos;t like it , but it &apos;s not it .
there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no nonsense .
he says , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i think right now . &quot;
oh , i live in a computer program -- that &apos;s weird .
so i asked myself what would happen when we challenge some of these kinds of things .
right ?
it &apos;s like this -- we have the work of the war when society , every one of us .
your iphone without people who are the same skin , same circuits , the same keyboard , always and again .
and then it became more powerful and strong and now it &apos;s a lot of time .
and i said to brian : &quot; what did tony do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , it &apos;s true that you &apos;re going to be in fake ? &quot;
but how do you sit on a mentally normal way ?
so all of these things were all the things that tony came up with the most important , proof of his own , that he was crazy .
he came in useful companies and the 30 percent of the workforce , and the u.s. cities , just as in the world &apos;s world .
and i added , &quot; i have a list of batman in my pocket .
and the jewelry are always the most powerful aspects of the personality .
and as well as it was , two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended up .
in fact , the trend went to the rest of the world of the world .
and as a result of this conversation , it &apos;s very , very difficult to say , i represent the true islam . &quot;
it may be that a big war between east and west was used , and that it was necessary in the framework of democracy .
and even though the president , it &apos;s a very , very good thing , very good , very good to the islam of islam , is not the enemy , there is a natural impulse in the other side of the other side of the other side as enemy .
when the treasure in 2000 sank in 2000 , you just watched the peak of the best , the scientists who had the scientists who had ever been the scientists in the world -- that at that time as a endangered kind of conceptual conceptual .
the day after our arrived , two of us were with the ground of the room two , space 2 more than 4,000 dollars , and space 2 , more than 4,000 penguins .
we &apos;ve used this method in the treasure rescue again .
and that &apos;s really important because african penguin was explained to a endangered way of a endangered way .
in the most popular , the most popular , the most popular , a computer , in the most violent , and even before the police police .
people are open for the most powerful .
we launched this campaign -- very fun -- , &quot; every egg counts . &quot;
this is not a second class of the second grade .
these teach the lessons of abstract abstract , abstract .
suzanne turned on a leg and said , &quot; what you &apos;re doing is not the neighbor , you can &apos;t do that . that &apos;s the rest of the comments .
now -- it &apos;s not the whole story .
and achilles takes a body body and the wild , and the two men see it , and the two men see each other and recognize each other as a divine .
this is what the cells really look at me in biology and science , which is looking at living cells in the microscope .
every grain of sand has a size of a millimeter .
you can see these kinds of things .
this picture was the beginning of the world &apos;s beginning .
we all see the same from inside , believe me .
the walls are 700 mm thick , solid concrete .
and that &apos;s a x-ray .
it has human associations .
in x-ray , we see all the little little of the little of the world &apos;s little .
i had to have the car in the middle of the middle , for himself , for themselves .
yes , they gave 12 monkeys for a week , and after that week , they just used them as a toilet .
science actually says that we &apos;re going to live forever .
no , i &apos;m going to be a tooth .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you . goodbye .
where do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we &apos;re both not agree .
not professor and ownership , only two spirits , ready to get to the .
and then my life was fine .
everything i saw in the manufacturing was that it was right between the most important between the most violent and the most powerful .
would it be time to process information ?
we spent a lot of time with a billion dollars , and they &apos;re going to hear a billion dollars to study a billion of the world &apos;s billion , and what we found was shocking , but then later , more shocking .
then there &apos;s dan brides .
we were upset that these companies were fast , and they were very , very important in london , and the most important in london was very much of the most important in london .
that &apos;s too complex and difficult to change it .
we &apos;re all going to die . we &apos;re all going to be old . we &apos;re all going to leave them . people leave us .
there are places that you can &apos;t go to , thought that you can &apos;t think of worlds that you can &apos;t plug longer .
they have a more powerful and an freedom of that i believe that they &apos;re the foundation of a new kind of new york .
she &apos;s hit the decision , not to get a more sophisticated or a life , but their life is devoted to that , that this is not happening any other girl .
we &apos;re all refugees .
but you &apos;re going to get this thing to the head , and then it happens .
but this is not what you do . &quot;
i miss michael .
but he didn &apos;t find it , but he didn &apos;t get him to the staff , but they said , &quot; you &apos;re going to go to the recovery , or you &apos;re going to get . &quot;
ah ! we meet them , the secret beloved . let &apos;s pull them out .
if it &apos;s on the box , which is the most important thing that &apos;s the most important thing .
the characteristics that are the word of the word is so often to see in adults that we should eliminate this age of the old word , and that &apos;s what it is associated with , to criticize behavior , which is associated with the most irrational and irrational thinking .
if i was the ability to get my sister to pay the 10 percent of interest , i &apos;m going to be struck by her last loan , i &apos;m going to be able to get your ability to get more money from me to get it back to it .
it &apos;s why we &apos;re not living in the dark times .
and the third are all the sounds we create people who are making the most powerful .
this is after selective &apos;s .
there are many of the most powerful of the wild , under other people , like animals , and they taught us that i have a different time for another time .
so that was extremely embarrassing .
and if you wonder how much that is , this is 16 kb here .
so 37 is our demographic .
it &apos;s very impressive and a very beautiful concert .
and these are the themes that actually are at the heart .
a generation that &apos;s going to be so much more meaning from video games than the real world .
all of these are problems outside of my life .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of video games means for our civilization .
finally ! finally ! this was it .
it would be really good .
so , you get fast from the simple to complex , if you do more . that &apos;s what we like .
and then they &apos;re looking at them , and it &apos;s a physical -- i thought that &apos;s a long time until she explained to me , that &apos;s what they &apos;re thinking about , so they think about it .
it &apos;s going to go into the other direction .
girl : there was a sphere and a a sphere , because it &apos;s two completely different types of energy , and if you &apos;re going to fall it at the same time , maybe you fall up .
but we could not train a thousand new teachers to save our lives .
and it depends on a computer system . &quot;
and then we &apos;re going to be able to make ourselves just as we have the world around us .
this is incredible implications .
why do you do what you do ?
everybody would want to do the new version .
they &apos;re going to affect us too much .
they &apos;re even going to live on this moment .
i &apos;m going to be able to get his words back to the order .
&quot; well , yes , i said , &quot; funny , you ask that .
it &apos;s , &quot; you don &apos;t need to do it again . &quot;
we saw that , and i was grateful because she said , &quot; wow ! &quot; wow ! this is a mess . &quot;
the goal of the project is just simple .
this is completely personalized medicine in the world .
now the answer is a team team .
i work with the most serious and the most serious thing , which is a little serious problems in the project , problems that should not have been there .
in medicine , there are so many people who don &apos;t want to change change , just not if a computer engineer has the answer to the answer .
you can really find novel solutions that haven &apos;t been seen , and that &apos;s very fast and just .
yeah , good , your guys are going to give me my life because it was about beautiful , beautiful , beautiful , beautiful form .
no , but it &apos;s true : the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i met the most popular .
and i didn &apos;t ask them to draw nice cartoons .
thank you .
so , &quot; our lonely earth brought me a lot of the meeting with the audience .
we have a lot of time for the existence of animals on this planet as they &apos;ve been here until we &apos;ve been able to reach the second microbial era .
his impact is the distribution of this very thin , very thin , and we had a very powerful death of dinosaurs , the death of this beautiful , the death of this beautiful , and so much else , and so much else .
it &apos;s the supreme of the top of the time , t. rex .
they hate animals .
this is when material comes from the deep earth and the surface , spread over the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m a little bit of the coast of the coast , what will happen with me ?
they have a crash . they have two options : they &apos;re going to die , or they &apos;re going to say , &quot; we &apos;re going to be saving 75 percent of them , mentally .
and the blessing , blessing and achilles .
some of you are countries who think that deregulation or no regulation of the best way is to attract investment , trade , trade .
the answer is simple : the chinese define these factories as chemical businesses , not as a drug , and they don &apos;t check them .
i don &apos;t know what we can do , but i can use my office to use them all together to develop a solution . &quot;
they need a safe environment .
now we have the impression that it &apos;s about the beginning of a new way of the regulation of international tasks .
human rights will be a very simple question : can i give people back to this one ?
or to find the young , the fire has put the fire to see if you can change it . &quot;
okay , ready ? go .
i was fire and flame .
again , again , we saw the spoken word of the walls .
after the fight , he woke up his favorite , and he said , &quot; you &apos;re a god . &quot; no , anderson , you &apos;re the god . &quot;
i travel much , if i teach , and i don &apos;t always get to see how my students reach their third step , but i had the happiness of the happiness that they were doing as they did .
my parents have called me sarah , which is a name name .
i want to talk about some ideas that have driven me to become an inclusive .
when i saw that war had been such incredibly intense consequences , and that the most amazing thing was that the most powerful thing could be a factor in conflict , i wanted to be a photographer to be a war war .
at the same time in south africa , after nelson mandela had been released from prison , the black population was the last phase of liberation .
and the next day i made myself on rwanda , and it was when i was up in the hell of hell .
after the fall of the fall of the water in indonesia , i started studying the conditions of poverty in a country that was on the way to the modernization .
a hospital of the doctors without borders , &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
the most efficient thing is that the percentage of the soldiers , which are a match , is a lot higher than in the world in any other history .
so to ensure that so little as possible , we can have all these procedures in the choice .
so you choose to be like this .
but this is a broad and pretty difficult topic , so i had to be approved .
the size is the population -- here &apos;s big china , here &apos;s big india .
and in all eastern religions , japan was the level of the same .
because death is going to be a child &apos;s child .
and what is the reason in qatar ?
they have a great amount of water .
all religions on the world are able to keep their values and adapt to these new world .
and then , as all of our generation , we lived in a computer system .
day eight .
in india , my favorite friends went to the best friends and i went to door with this same picture , every single house in india , and we did about a billion of the world .
this is the most powerful .
i asked them -- it &apos;s all the time -- and i asked them those questions that they want to ask them .
i think we owe debt of the millennium and ron st. john very much gratitude , i hope , ron is somewhere in the audience -- there &apos;s the founder of compression .
larry brilliant : first , are they not angry because of the injury of the unconscious ?
have a lot of a time built , &quot; the climate group . &quot;
why should we have a positive impact on the world , the world , as a company ?
they save 85 percent electricity with an led that they had used with a old light bulb .
sometimes people think that 100 percent are pretty hard , and we had this conversation in the company .
a more common one paid themselves in seven or eight years .
from our irregular , in ikea , there are 47 percent of women today , but that &apos;s not enough and we want to close this gap and follow this gap to the high management .
there was a equation in my family , about this : if you &apos;re intelligent , you &apos;re not a spiritual .
this is what he wrote , &quot; is the integrated structure of reality . &quot;
anyone who &apos;s going to break you or you can get the contributions of your own .
and the end of our favorite , we realized the openness of the other .
and as i would go back to bangalore , and often to be active discussions at my friends , where we discussed different themes while they were in the way they were going to be a drink of new people , where they were paying a drink of the day , as what they paid to do .
he &apos;s looking for forgiveness , and he said that he wants to make life of his child child .
this is a pretty happy thing to be quite happy , and it had no deaths to be able to be able to be killed , even though dozens of people were killed in liberia .
and what are we responsible for this ?
it &apos;s a very comforting -- not ? -- that the media of the world makes a bad job that a little group of activists in the situation is able to publish more from this kind of information than the rest of the press .
j yeah . this was the cover in the guardian and it was printed in all countries around kenya , in the most violent and south african press .
j the effects on people who worked on this was a lot of time .
and there &apos;s a lot of information .
i would care about what we &apos;ve heard about -- i &apos;m curious to the opinion of ted audience .
and we said , &quot; oh , tell us more .
so you have to be careful with the term of hackers .
and just one month ago , it was passed out of the world &apos;s parliament .
and from all these numbers , i start with only two or three variables .
this piece can be very different , and it &apos;s going to be a lot of different , depending on where you &apos;re going to get it .
first of all , i read about this in a diary in a diary , which is between the most responsible medicine and seven .
so , according to this study , the best thing is to be the best to be in the very short , but not to get into the long time , and not to get into it until it gets black , and a two-digit , brown sugar or water .
and then in the next summer , i worked under the line of dr. , in fort , texas , texas .
and this realization is incredibly for the efficiency of chemotherapy , maybe for many different cancers .
for example , the very organic organic compounds are chemical pollutants that are found in our schools , care and the workplace .
because all of these solutions are , of course , they &apos;re sustainable and they &apos;re more powerful -- they &apos;re for our generation and for the next generations .
and immediately , a voice called &quot; wael ! &quot;
after the conference , after my talk , people came to me , men and women .
hard !
a prosthetic is not more for the need to be a lack of a lack .
we &apos;re all different perspectives .
i was in the middle of the olympic games , and i was in the olympics .
about 80 percent of these &apos;s young people are young people .
and they &apos;re most unemployment , and they &apos;re the banks , the banks , the banks , the banks , the u.s. , the of europe , and america , which they produce , exposed to .
they have a kind of tools that can make them a piece of chicken or fish , and then it looks like cattle .
people think about following questions : will we continue to be victims of a higher gdp ?
there &apos;s nothing up there , but the conditions were ideal for the winter of the world .
now , the series was not even coming out , so they &apos;re the first ones that get this .
mars more similar than the earth seems to be as much as the earth .
sousa was afraid that we &apos;re going to lose the possibility of this , quote , &quot; machines . &quot; they would take us .
but much more importantly , that technology was generally used to create new work to create new health care that they &apos;re doing in their clients , and then in 1940 , in 1940 , when a double one was a double , the majority of the world &apos;s population , the majority of the line was to be made .
and i ...
for the balance i &apos;m trying to do , i &apos;m trying to ask as good liberal , of course , something from the government . a mistake , right ?
this realization is very powerful , very , very , very , very , very powerful .
okay , i want to summarize anybody , but i &apos;m just noticed that the person on the right is a liar .
&quot; honey , you don &apos;t see fat , no . &quot;
a different study showed that strangers lie in the first 10 minutes of their meeting .
here &apos;s a theorist with her kittens .
i &apos;m going to say it again .
and the other is not supposed to look at the eyes .
we say , &quot; yes , &quot; while we shake the head .
science has been very much more comfortable to daylight .
look at exactly the same and you &apos;ll see the world &apos;s best smile .
so in this way , it can be a sense of the way that we can be a little bit more , a little bit more than the moral rules in terms of our moral rules .
and that &apos;s not true , right ?
you know , we often think language is the world that we live in , but that &apos;s not true .
so what &apos;s like a computer designer when not even tragic , and it &apos;s not a kind of a bit of a way of the harry , acting as ethnic .
six months after any explanation , they were going to get me free .
this is what i &apos;m doing .
when i was 10 , i read james country , &quot; the &quot; the country country &quot; and i was broken on this book .
a new song i proposed to you .
so i took a little time to study coke .
and in the remote areas of africa , it &apos;s hard to find a good road .
how do you have incentive based on the effects that you have to act on these remote villages ?
i don &apos;t like that as technically as &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they &apos;re going to wait to be cut .
much more people would have been acceptable .
today i &apos;m going to tell you two things . first , what we &apos;ve lost , and second , how we get it .
here you can see the largest part of the living of the florida of florida .
if there &apos;s no fishing fishing , because it &apos;s protected , or the management , it &apos;s great .
after a few years after five to seven years , the fish come back , food , and then the algae grow again .
you can see the border of the world &apos;s border , because there are the boats all the back of the boats .
so if it &apos;s so good when that &apos;s so easy , how much is there ?
so the protection of the sea and the ocean has become a common for funding of governments and the world &apos;s institutions , and that &apos;s not acceptable .
in the coral reefs , we found that the pyramid is the equivalent to the most powerful , where five lions come on a computer system .
okay , chimborazo , thank you so much that you have a part of your spiritual experience . thank you .
it has been the longest creatures in the ocean .
they come to the submersible -- they come to the eyes , and they &apos;re looking at the tunnel .
and we &apos;re trying to do with our partners in the woods hole , these virtual world -- that the world , that the , that &apos;s the , to bring this curved area -- to bring into the lab .
bl : these worms don &apos;t have a computer company . they don &apos;t have a mouth .
what we &apos;ve seen is from the pacific .
we &apos;re going to try to show you the pacific in the world .
these worms grow several inches in the week !
the concept of the most powerful is the equivalent of the brain .
and the rest of a percent is looking for the formula that you can apply in the situation .
they also have the mathematical structure that &apos;s from the most violent , measurements , points , points , and the dots , and the dots , and the points of the , is talking .
the students have to make this create . they have to make them .
and the best thing , or one of the best parts , is that we don &apos;t get the answer from the end of the world &apos;s end .
what &apos;s going on with the small hadron collider ?
here you find the fastest growing young population in the world .
it &apos;s a lot of the time . there &apos;s no government schools in the slums .
this is a computer that was installed on the entrance of your slum , by a more nuanced social entrepreneur called sugata mitra , who took the most powerful experiments that were showed that kids were doing a lot of conditions , and they can learn that children can learn under a computer .
well , the key is motivation , and it &apos;s in two ways .
this is a school in a bus on a construction site in a field of a construction sentence , which is the fastest growing city .
they should turn it into an mcdonald &apos;s .
there are formal framework , schools , hospitals , hospitals , where innovation can happen , and informal environments , communities , social networks .
every child to age 15 , which wants to have a place in a school , will be able to get a death .
and while i look at it , this scene comes to tears , and i &apos;ve been doing that for 25 years .
here &apos;s a few parents from teenagers , and we have to cook for them -- and they &apos;re going to eat every night for two , three or four . it &apos;s ridiculous .
he &apos;s going to go around and get it all !
these gay people like me , as a full citizen , are treated as full citizens , and it &apos;s just written in front of our nose .
there &apos;s people afraid to have their job , so they don &apos;t show who they really are , here at home , it &apos;s not just north carolina ; in all states without color , it &apos;s legal .
think about it .
and i got scared .
about three years ago , i read a paper in new york times .
who were my grandparents ?
it helps us to be what we could have .
so evolution works .
and in fact , this insect is this insect .
i &apos;ve been responding to someone &apos;s .
it &apos;s not just 43 to 44 degrees c , and it &apos;s a constant temperature , but it keeps a constant temperature .
but contrast to the contrast is that it &apos;s going to be like this .
here &apos;s the american the russians , and yes , it was -- actually -- a game .
she started telling me , and all the parents are going to recognize the most powerful .
i have a more inclusive story .
our lives is determined by data , and the presentation of this data is to create a chance of creating a amazing interfaces that can tell great stories .
i also have a look at the different of the different things , because you can pick what you want to highlight from the data data .
it &apos;s a man who &apos;s sitting in the box and controlling this kind of thing .
a more of about 11 sheep per hour , which is a computer of 68 cents .
in the reason , you can see -- what you see on the left is the most powerful , and you see the frame of the frame of the frame of the frame of 16 people who didn &apos;t know what they do .
and the bell bell : demand , character -- aaron , and we took all these individual pieces and we were asking them to another mechanical turk .
but we knew that we needed the right person to put us on the right person , and we could build something that we could build .
and under all the individual frames , people in the project have shifted .
thank you .
so i made rows of images , cut , and added them together in the world .
one of them is that you &apos;re always seeing one part of his image , and it leads to a very free design .
and sometimes i have a emotional response to news , like the earthquake in haiti .
then i went 50 miles , then 60 miles .
it &apos;s like the different layers of that we &apos;re made , and what we &apos;re doing as our identity .
another thing is in a public library in san jose , california .
so every building has its own personality .
it may be easier to be easier than ever before , a good living .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re particularly intimidating .
it &apos;s just too strange .
you know , in the middle ages , in england , if you met somebody who was very poor , you called this one &quot; unhappy . &quot; literally , somebody who was lucky , the fate , not a lot of the fate , the fate , not a , the fate , not a , the fate , not a , the fate , not a , the fate , not a , the fate , not a , a , the fate , not a , the fate , not a , a , the fate ,
and it will make it the youngest court with angels and the heavens , and the sky will open up .
i told you the action of the kind of kind of thing .
what i think i &apos;m talking about is success and failure .
we should make sure that we are really the creator of our own own own own own own own own own own own .
alain de botton : a computer scientist , fuzzy
if you train for this sport , you don &apos;t smile .
you know , you &apos;re swimming with a little bit of a little bit of a minute , and you &apos;re going to go 60 trains a minute , so you &apos;re never really going to be good .
they &apos;re in the liquid .
my breath is down to three of the time , the minute .
and the should worry about me , i didn &apos;t make it .
i swam with this thing .
it &apos;s the only thing that i &apos;m interested in .
there &apos;s already today .
the gateway can be a smartphone , or it could be a particularly powerful tunnel , like today , many of these things are special , because they &apos;re not so much integrated .
many of you have the phillips direct life .
this is a very important part of our life . we should sleep a third of our lives .
ok . now let &apos;s go from sleep to disease .
so we can change the medicine in the world &apos;s population , in all ages , from the world , or generations to the seniors , and the most popular arena , the entire spectrum of disease -- i hope i &apos;m going to give you a sense of that -- about the globe .
so , i hope i &apos;ve convinced them -- the impact on the top of the world &apos;s , are enormous and the effects of disease are also amazing in all these different diseases and more .
how do we create stable societies ? longevity .
and in novel , a certain called the memex is produced . and he says , maybe it &apos;s not the best way , and destroyed the whole system .
and so there would be no more sophisticated .
and it &apos;s a great thing .

first of all , some strands of magnetic field are trapped in the inner , but the superconductor doesn &apos;t like it if you move , because your movements are using energy , and so the most important thing .
and that round magnet can also expand , of course , to form a solar track .
and it was inspired by this quote from tata adams . the situation is from &quot; through &quot; through the galaxy . &quot;
because of course , they don &apos;t explain how to do that when you want to do it , and not a more powerful one .
but even though they were not convinced , they said , &quot; okay , we call back . &quot;

well , there &apos;s a very clear example where a of me feels very different , when it was made from another person .
and in the meantime , i got two daughters .
so they didn &apos;t know the rules that the other person plays .
if these dots were cars on a computer system , they wouldn &apos;t have any idea what &apos;s going on .
we &apos;ve shown that we can explain a big part of the data -- people actually plan their movements to the negative implications of the noise to finance .
this is from the marine academy of the marine minister .

it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a kind of a device device , not because it shows me how many of the most powerful i &apos;m going to do every day , but because it &apos;s 24 hours , what i do .
that was never shown .
the productivity of these magnets is so big that we can see a single neutron with this technique .
that you don &apos;t have to tap the tumor .
if the magnet is big enough , and your resolution is high enough , you can actually all be able to get proteins in the body and start to understand the individual system .
most of us are going to find that , and interestingly , 12 vibrations per minute is about the most violent people .
so , if i &apos;m going to go to this -- -- longer than a few seconds , they would feel uncomfortable ; longer than a few minutes , and they would leave the room in the world .
that &apos;s all recognized . and that &apos;s the tune that &apos;s the most common thing to hear in the world .

a lot of my early career i wanted to figure out how the wings of insects produce enough power to keep themselves in the air .
let &apos;s study this idea of simplicity .
this is a beautiful picture of visual health &apos;s mouse from jeff &apos;s lab , and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk .
they &apos;re a more powerful , a few behaviors to make some behavior , another one of the other people &apos;s own , and patterns and they can think that this works in a very complicated system .
our mission is to build a more realistic and realistic computer model of human brain .
he &apos;s home and drinking tea .
if you look closer , you &apos;re looking at the neocortex , you know , it &apos;s from louder small components .
how many per type of tree is there ? where are they put ?
we can look at the tissue . and we can change neurons .
we can upload all these neurons , every single one in its own own own own own own own own , and they see what happens .
and the brain &apos;s brain says that the secrets of the brain can be solved soon . mental illness , perception , perception : they &apos;re made of neurons and electrical signals , and he &apos;s planning to find them with a supercomputer that &apos;s going to be the brain with the brain .
it would be needed two or three thousand bombs .
the air force started building smaller models , and started this .
that &apos;s what nasa did to get a more powerful , which would fly to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about the behavior of the behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write . because there &apos;s so much resonance that you can get from people .
the bottom ? yellow .
if you ask people that question , they usually think it &apos;s something with culture .
the countries on the right , the ones that give a lot of a lot of different forms .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this .
but back to get it back to the more complex .
a online online for 59 dollars .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we really don &apos;t know our biases so well .
and in medical medical , it &apos;s our view of our view .
and radio waves are limited .
so , in the way , you can use the eyes of the eyes with lower energy .
their intensity can be very quickly , and they can get very quickly off .
they &apos;re critical .
but that just .
cars have a lot of the time and they can communicate with each other and can communicate through the surface traffic pressure with the cars and so on .
dna is what &apos;s going to be true .
because it &apos;s actually not so many data .
you &apos;re going to be the genome , and the power of it is a kite medicine that is better than today -- it has no side side .
he &apos;s really easy -- just just a little bit of genes -- but we could completely be able to get it out .
we don &apos;t walk as small organisms alone on the world , but are part of a big ecosystem .
the consequences can be bad -- if we break or the earth -- but that &apos;s just the consequence of one of us .
now i &apos;m mainly here because it &apos;s a kind of a way that we have a way to have a page in the moment that we have a side of people who think that you &apos;re going to be able to make a dog , first of all , through rules , human rules .
they &apos;re just like &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just to beat . &quot; and therefore they &apos;re beaten .

not just with the puppy , but also with the rest of the family .
these are so simple .
their children are just to train .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , this windmill -- does it work ?
wk : yeah . i still think about energy .
because even though i used scientific terms in songs , sometimes it &apos;s very hard to leave them .

let &apos;s look at the third question .
the desert continued to expand a mile or two per year .
the homo erectus asked the same tool about 30 generations .
you can teach you in the lab , a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a time , and it &apos;s actually a kind of a kind of a kind of a object in other animals .
it &apos;s the wealth ; the pleasure of your needs to save time .
we &apos;ve achieved the species as a species .
but there &apos;s no evidence for that .
and as people started with this , objects like this far , it was a hint that a exchange between groups existed .
but who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m also because of the connections that people are going to go and never get out there , and they &apos;re never going to be able to meet the ideas of ideas , and i &apos;m also sure that technology will continue to be able to improve and so forth .
this is so high as a building building . i &apos;ve got the behavioral insurance as comparison .
but we don &apos;t talk about it , but we don &apos;t take it seriously .
these are just gone , these feelings , they &apos;re gone .
if we think about the most violent detection of the world , then the fast development is the problem because we can discover things that are constantly changing ?
i talked about that -- you know this situation if you don &apos;t get a diagnosis in the hospital ?
what about real people ?
we inhabit a part of their viruses ; it &apos;s new , and they &apos;re new , and they &apos;re a new way of being able to be .
after 10 other days with fever , she came back -- still a fever -- she has a little bit of oxygen -- little oxygen in their lungs .
it wasn &apos;t even a very often sequenced .
it &apos;s a classic processor , but it &apos;s completely new . nobody has ever seen it before .
a huge battery could have this .
so instead , we &apos;re going to invent something that fits to the most powerful of the world &apos;s office .
i brought a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of traffic on the top of the surface , a high density of high density , and a lot of salt in between .
but david is young and smart and he wants to build a computer , and so he builds -- he &apos;s building the first metal metal metal with this chemical composition .
so what do we learn from all of this ?
this video was taken in the most popular . six miles before the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the surface .
quickly , we realized that our garage wasn &apos;t big enough for this growing project .
i started to get to maria and their methods and how they found these kinds of things and how important they found that children are discovering things and they don &apos;t taught them to be a open way of being able to be able to be on open way to open .
evolution is often seen as this one way that we &apos;ve chosen , but it &apos;s actually a big number of possibilities .
i &apos;m going to skip this to the stage of space space .
our cities are endangered , because many of you are on the coast .
there are also stars and so forth .
so if we think about the behavior of the behavior or language language , how it &apos;s called the social scientists , it turns out to be language . so we think about communication .
this expression , as proud as proud , was studied by jessica tracy . she showed that the people and birth of birth to the blind people , they do that if they win in a computer .
so i thought about it . you &apos;re going to be on these people and see how they participate . could you get it to make it , and then they would be able to engage more ?
what happens in a computer system , what happens when you &apos;re going to go on on the surface of the stage ? how the following little manipulation , these tiny little little little little little ?
this is happening in the lab . the little exercise , for only a few minutes , where you can really apply that ? that &apos;s important .
these things . people are kind of a true thing , and they &apos;re showing themselves .
she was completely depressed and said , &quot; i don &apos;t have to look at this . &quot;
they need their bodies , privacy and two minutes . it can affect the other way to affect the other way .
and the swim of swimming , to get to their own , and to get a ant , and they &apos;re a ant , and they &apos;re going to go up to the brain , and they go up a blade of grass , and they go up a blade of grass .
and you have to have a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a bit of a time .
so it &apos;s like i think richard and me matters that these ideas are not being abused .
and of course , they &apos;re essentially extinct in the most flexible .
but under all these ideas that are very , very , very toxic in the world , are many toxic ideas .
and as we should not try and try and destroy them here .
and in my game , it &apos;s called the .
we put some ideas on the legs , we went international on tour .
i know you &apos;ll say , &quot; t , there &apos;s no music in music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
nobody hears each other . nobody familiar with the other .
you &apos;ll see the orchestra in a kind of a broad kind of a kind of a broad .
i don &apos;t want to go out that it should have been happening , but that we need to be better if it &apos;s about answer that , the questions that you have to consider , if you think about the consequences and the reactions .
they work in government government . they &apos;re driver .
five dollars can save life .
she deserves about two dollars a day , building a little bit of a computer , and i &apos;ve explained that they &apos;re not going to marry children before these things are done .
finally , from despair , they went and a way of old woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , if you &apos;re angry , you &apos;ll be able to keep the best talk you &apos;re going to regret .

i start where the story started , 1985 in southern africa .
now , before you get to the way you get the possibility of the possibility of the way you had the opportunity to shower ?
you see here -- 35 percent of these less famous houses , where 50,000 indigenous people live , 35 percent of the houses had a working shower .
21 percent of what we &apos;re repair is follow by the way we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to

it &apos;s the most powerful of my favorite .
i &apos;d like to think -- thank you .
and i can assure you , corn is in everything .
you should know that in every community that &apos;s already increasing the number of the world &apos;s number .
i &apos;ve led three to the antarctica .
but i &apos;m telling you where you &apos;re and what country you are . &quot;
we also explored the surface of the islands -- a very important kind of important thing for birds , one of the most important things in the pacific .
and we &apos;re as the rest of the world , a problem .
he coined the term &quot; reverse fishing . &quot;
of course , the most open and open seas , but the open seas , but the most important thing that everybody likes to look at was in trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific , with huge amounts of water and huge water .
now there are a immediate , immediate , automated , automated free free , even on the smartphone .
it &apos;s an endless debate and there &apos;s no conclusions , no single answer to it , but if you &apos;re a juvenile like me , you say , &quot; well , what are the data saying ? &quot;
instead , he &apos;s very carefully documented what happens again when technology is in a environment and in a community .
so there &apos;s , of course , two different ways .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually an yves painting painting .
i mean , it was at least , like it was happy .
now , there was a question that i &apos;m going to ask a while to get a while in the head : well , can i do more from the things that i like to do in design , and less of that i don &apos;t like to do ?
and here &apos;s it from the front .
they &apos;re a terrible situation without a way .
they &apos;re going to be in hospitals .
as a 12-year-old , for example , i was considered a extraordinarily talented in the world , because i knew the most powerful , and i know how to use the most powerful , and i can do it quickly with the most important .
i &apos;ve seen this value of older people in so many of my friends , who are in their 60s , &apos; 70s , &apos; 80s , and the &apos; 90s still active , farmers , lawyers and doctors .
as a christian , and made out of the computer , and made out of the young jewish men , young jewish men in the united states , and canada , who also went back to the bible .
the case of the world &apos;s case , the last muslim of europe , the last muslim
the biggest bad , the most bad , don &apos;t want these rocks to be a little bit of the rocks . so he tries to prevent them on the top of the world .
and one of my favorites is a convincing from yemen .
&quot; and when is the article coming out ? &quot;
and it &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of that that we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; &#93; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous when a group of itself is identified as extremely educated .
and the most powerful thing : islam &apos;s concern , the chimpanzee
let &apos;s look at it .
let me highlight it for you .
let me show you this here .
and when i started with the design , i &apos;ve discovered something strange about myself .
so they have the eye and then come to the concepts .
but of course china has a massive population .
but what that is , is that this kind of visualization of information is a form of information .
it &apos;s even a pleasure to do with you , because you &apos;re visual .
the most important thing is named the eden project in britain .
why don &apos;t it smell as a potato or the other thing ? so there are two theories .
and a theory allows a less to work .
now , after some months of looking at this , i discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule that you call a little bit of the molecule , and that &apos;s exactly the same thing .
this is the basis for the device that these two people have built from ford .
they made it ... and it &apos;s just like coumarin .
this was a good thing .
and at the time , a series of things that i want to pay you to do is to pay attention to it .
and she actually didn &apos;t have a notion of the context that she was landed in .
norman !
i didn &apos;t say anybody , neither my mother , nor my father , not my sister , my brother , my brother , my cousins , my grandparents , my grandparents , no one .
i reports of this . i &apos;m just saying to say that i had two things when i left the orphanage , which i wanted to do . that was a , my family , and the other was to write poems .
and this is how we look for them .
and then you hope that one of us is going to go up and find little parts .
he had a more powerful and so to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a female and probably much smaller family family , and it had been a lot of smaller family members to achieve his age of 12 years .
is this a good evolutionary adaptation or will it lead to that we will be the bureaucratic way of earth on earth ?
but will we do that or will we take nature to the course of the course ?
one day , a few weeks or maybe a year later , i was with my favorite in a store for a store for a store , and i wanted to buy a little bit of a time .
this meant a fundamental change for me .
my hint : about 70 layers of this , the most powerful .
you want to know how obsessed with me ? this project is just for me , and yet i went so far , i went to ebay a chinese newspaper from northern san francisco to buy the bird with it .
when we &apos;re going to get the way to the spectacular blue mountains in the west of sydney , it was a perfect kind of a , the sun , the smell of the computer and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you &apos;re ever going to walk again , just with a computer company . &quot;
i remember that my father was going to be out of the wheelchair , and i was up by the top to the bottom , and i felt the first time to go to the sun .
they said , &quot; we &apos;ll put you next to you , because we think that &apos;s good for you . &quot;
she was going to me the phone phone and i called the flight school , i &apos;m going to be a little bit of a time , and i said that i &apos;d like to be a book of a book .
and i said , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and mom and dad ? were never up .
i &apos;m in this world , but i work in a very strict way .
it &apos;s like a computer of the world &apos;s population of a richard serra .
how to hell , i should make a phone in three weeks if i have these things that have developed over millions of years ?
each of these elements could be on the wall as a kind of object .
in his days , he was the highest follower in british .
i look at individual , and how they flow -- how they expand and flow . it &apos;s based on furniture , but it &apos;s not the most important thing . it &apos;s been made from aluminum , as unlike aluminum and it &apos;s grown .
this is the car of the future . it &apos;s a water vessel .
if you put it next to contemporary architecture , it feels totally of course .
this is my studio . it &apos;s underground .
it was made from plywood .
and i was doing my dr. , i had the happiness of being a member of a computer , which was used to the first time to explore the ocean .
there was one of these most powerful .
he uses red bioluminescence like a computer company to be a more powerful thing to be blind to animals , and can see it without being seen .
so they use it to find them and partners .
i urge you to call a different science that still uses hundreds of years old technology .
this is a magical place .
so i made myself a value of sleep .
and at june , in june , i heard a loud bang on the disk , which changed my life and finished a duck .
and here &apos;s the duck .
after the price , my life changed .
another example of the effects of the effects of birds on the life of birds .
so , if i &apos;m like this -- this is the sound for purple .
depending on how i &apos;m going to hear it , i can hear music with the food , and i &apos;m going to get to the food .
one of them is &quot; i have a dream of martin luther king , and the other is by hitler .
now , you can see more often that former general general is now the most popular .
you don &apos;t want to say anything about it , which could be used against a use . &quot;
absolutely critical .
and what happens when teachers want order to be okay ?
and why not ? you don &apos;t trust the law . why don &apos;t you trust the law ?
because it &apos;s so that freedom has a structure of structure .
because life is complex . and here &apos;s the hardest change , and we have to be the most important thing : we need to be the authority for the interpretation and the officer .
a free society needs red and green lights , otherwise it will be very much a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot .
and the boundaries of interest , the most important thing to calculate , and the supply of the supply that you can take .
well , if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard to be a little bit of round of columns with a ruler .
he had a very bad job .
he had only a more powerful one .
but the problem , to leave rules and incentives , is that they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the professional activity . and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to do the professional activity in two ways .
so smart , so , as nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that some smart people can get this for unlimited time .
why has this idea spread ?
people want to be a lot of time .
it was an extraordinary time . i &apos;m going to light the mentality now , which we -- america and the rest of the world -- then had had .
this was a little bit of a little bit of the turtle that &apos;s the turtle .
we have to do this with a complete kind of thing .
what i want to show you is what you need to transport 34 pounds tall .
what would have been if they had nuclear weapons ?
we go down and bring the truck to the truck that you just saw somewhere in the world .
part of the problem is that the most expensive self is , overwhelmed with a nuclear disaster .
it was sent to someone who &apos;s a computer of the world &apos;s favorite , the fact that it was hard to be america .
there are many black sheep out there that are done the wrong things and the problems still have come .
we can show our results . we can make things better .
how can we tap them up ?
it &apos;s a dangerous working working working .
imagine , we could , because if we could , we could achieve more .
governments who make most progress are governments who have found ways , &quot; shared value in business , instead of seeing the government , the government &apos;s actor , who has the most common .
maybe i can cut this , i &apos;m going to take the brain , and i can change my cut .
i want to zoom on .
come on to me a moment with me in the 19th century , very precisely at june .
we could certainly be so productive if facebook or twitter don &apos;t cost us so much time .
they look at ray in the british government to get money for the building of babbage &apos;s machines , because they believed that these machines have tremendous practical effects for society .
these benefits didn &apos;t just have less wealthy men , but they also were upset , and they also were upset about the most important , rather than answer the questions .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i learned something about life .
if you start looking at the very small things -- this person has written a whole article , and said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and all of these aren &apos;t old enough , they have no idea how these infection happened -- because this is by these neocortical .
there are about 10,000 programs .
this would be the frequency of the decline in the of the flight of the field of the field of the field of the field of the field of the world &apos;s voice .
everywhere life is , you will have this distribution , unlike this distribution .
too hot , too hot .
the cop asks , &quot; are you sure ? hey , you &apos;re sure you &apos;ve lost that here ? &quot;
these are the data of one survey in a single district in zambia , from a few years ago , which i &apos;ve got to have .
as you see , bruce palin was much more hair at the time .
you could talk about 10,000 , 20,000 or 30,000 dollars when i had time , or it was in my plan , and i didn &apos;t just have it in vacation .
instead of teaching people how to put the forms on the cell phones , we should develop software that allows you to do that , without practice and without my favorite , without my own , and my favorite .
that &apos;s less than i &apos;ve been making for two weeks when i went to a consultants .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , life or the balloon , we need to change the height .
that can be in spirituality .
and that &apos;s why they need weather weather .
i promised that i was going to be the next time i would fly around the world , no fuel will be independent , regardless of fossil fuels to be safe , not to be threatened by the most powerful .
i think you need a pilot in the airplane , who can talk to the universities who can talk to students , with politicians during the flight , and it can actually make it a human adventure .
and what is the goal ?
this is why all people who believe that in this spirit are welcome to that , welcome to this team .
now you just need a laptop .
anyway , for us , africa was a magical place .
the next thing i want to create clarity is what this problem is and what it is .
this is crazy , really , if you think about it .
let &apos;s stop a second with the nonsense .
the fact is that we &apos;re the first generation , the disease and this extreme poverty in the eyes can see , you see it , you &apos;re going to say it and you don &apos;t have to stand .
it &apos;s a on the nerves .
this year is a test for us , especially for leaders of the ottoman states , which are launched and the history of the world .
people are going to find that slowly .
and with this one campaign as our screen , my organization , data , data , and other groups that the energy and enthusiasm from hollywood to the inner of hollywood is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
and step for step , you go forward , a nurse , a teacher , a single , and life will be saved .
the idea that the internet has changed the internet , which is changing their lives , a country -- and a continent of the it just made the analog , and the continent is just to be able to get to digital -- the head .
lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
so , their job is to recognize what this shapes is , and what kiki is .
now , if you &apos;re not just going to be a little bit of the way , this sentence is literally wrong .
if we solve a problem or something new , we compare that what we already know with what &apos;s unknown to us .
nadia malone : i &apos;m glad to be here .
they don &apos;t fit to all these representations .
pm : i don &apos;t think i &apos;m .
how do you handle it , you personally , but with your favorite , you &apos;re also with your own ?
some of my reporters were arrested .
this is very clear a different picture of yemen .
my heart was three times too big .
this is a list of side side : if you eat too much salt like a lot of salt , like a computer and a sandwich , you probably land on the intensive care .
but soon , i showed symptoms for the most important and i had to go back to the ted , knowing that i would never see my home .
i was sitting there and talked about a little bit of a little bit of the time for the senate and asked him what i needed when i needed a transplant , to prepare me .
i was at a dozen machines that were thought of life .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these main things is also in the united states to be 200 percent .
also , interesting , the same business , that sold us the 80 million pounds of atrazine , which is the antidote to the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; and the same company . &quot;
we also launched as a computer company .
what would our generations say to us when they &apos;re going to be child , and i had a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of artificial , some artificial a. , and a little bit of a semester a.
the problem is that you &apos;re in my village , oakland , in most of our villages , that connection .
here &apos;s the accumulation of the world &apos;s largest way to the airport of los angeles .
i offered five cents for every single day .
the most important thing can &apos;t be able to be able to be global , it &apos;s become global .
here you see , in red , the spread of the world &apos;s distribution .
they &apos;re like a mouse that looks at the foot of a elephant , and the biggest part of them remains .
they look out of their tree tree and they come from all directions around us .
redwoods have a tremendous surface that spreads in the sky because they tend to do something that is called the most powerful -- repetition .
and the redwood maintenance stability , the redwood maintenance stability , just like a cathedral , and help the tree longer .
it &apos;s absolutely a little bit of a little bit of the time that you see .
but for recently , all the doors of the palace are going to break up and break the walls .
this was 25 years ago .
so , for example , let &apos;s first look at the most popular .
how do these people do with these infected computers ?
and you can afford to see how we work -- how security works -- and try to find a way to find the most powerful , which we meet , to deal with .
they &apos;re going to see that you can see a more powerful one down there : the more powerful / d / and if you open this image image on your computer , that program is downloaded and managed .
and if you look at the images of the scene , you can see that the roman is the opposite of the buddhist .
we need to find any way to make sure that everything is playing , even though the computer is going to be .
but i don &apos;t have to do anything .
this person around the consultants is with hubris .
why should we believe what he says ? &quot;
how does his future look like ?
these forces disappear completely , no one &apos;s going to be the 2011 .
it would be good if people were , and they would take this kind of calculations seriously and they would be able to do that , because this would change things . but it would change things on two types of ways .
that means we see a copy of ourselves , if you just used one part of the most powerful , that &apos;s going to be a more interesting and more worse and more honest and a worse thing .
and the happy few , jill and kevin ? well , they came back from their own , and they saw that their video had been spreading as a computer .
thank you !
you &apos;re going to go into the distance .
this is what was taught to do it since he was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had a mentor like a vegetarian who taught me how to do a little bit of a time .
what &apos;s it is that you &apos;re going to drive in life today ? not 10 years ago .
what do you do with what you &apos;re doing , and it &apos;s going to happen ?
didn &apos;t have the -- time . didn &apos;t have the -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager . didn &apos;t ...
in this moment , or unconscious , or unconscious , in which you decide to focus on something , you can make a meaning and whatever it means , it &apos;s going to make feelings .
have you ever done what did , and you &apos;re , &quot; that was me . &quot;
to death , and so god in his infinite wisdom , gave us another human need : the uncertainty .
but that &apos;s true : we need it . we can do it through intimacy , through friendship , through prayers , through the motion , through the motion in nature .
and there are seven different beliefs , and i can &apos;t go through it because i &apos;m through . the last element is feeling .
jewish man with family in the fragmented area , somebody in new york , who died if he would have been on the day , and this man who wanted to be a terrorist and he said it was very clear .
instead , i &apos;m interested in developing tools , with the big number of people who can tell their stories , people everywhere on the world .
the color of particles is the kind of feeling of feeling -- happy , positive feelings .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was all day on the computer . &quot;
and when i go over here , the list starts to walk , and there are thousands of feelings that were collected .
the 10 themes radiation , and circle the time .
it &apos;s called &quot; universe : unveiling of our modern mythology . &quot;
we can click that and see this kenyan image of the wmap ford , like her husband &apos;s mine .
you can also look at quotes when you want to read quotes to climate change .
so people feel clouds as something that is in the ways .
in life , they started tens of thousands of members in almost 100 countries around the earth .
they just need one step out to go out , and that &apos;s what we usually think that &apos;s so common that all other people are missing .
so look up , admire the slightest beauty , and think about it , and you think about the head in the clouds .
that would have been 25,000 recordings that would have done this : &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the most powerful to buy my first , and it was a huge machine .
these images come from a virtual plug .
here you can see how the knife is in the heart .
it &apos;s a little bit of mechanical pen , which is very , very fast , very fast .
this is a really interesting project .
so he does .
so , very talented people .
i went to the kids so often as possible to get out of the academic stuff with the real world in connection .
it &apos;s not all , but it &apos;s a incredibly powerful summary of everything we know about the basics of nature .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details why we think of the universe so that it &apos;s going to be the universe , but it &apos;s trying to explain physics , which we know .
and over my career , the course of my career is always something in me .
in 2001 , i visited her while a computer .
we got a lot of more sophisticated .
this is the first degree of the first degree in 2004 .
he &apos;s a short time ago , and he was filmed with someone who was all familiar with them .
every one is going to have a mismatch , but in different scientific disciplines .
i have my first computer as a teenager in tunis and it was a really great device .
he &apos;s exploring the brain using mri and he said that &apos;s the most beautiful brain that he ever lied .
and the next few slides i &apos;m going to explain to you is that .
transistors are getting smaller to allow them to make it better and made our technology better .
our main system is behind this lens .
i had a gut gut that we &apos;re wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so we know what a radius is .
i like to call them the most powerful of the world &apos;s most powerful , because they &apos;re kind of a kind of a kind of a bit of the time .
we can see more detail in our galaxy than somewhere else .
and that brings us a factor of 20th .
so there was a bunch of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot there .
it &apos;s a lot more powerful than the other and the cloud will be taken apart .
and i hope that i &apos;ve convinced you at least that we have a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy .
one day i was in the streets of new york , and i saw some kids between the stairs , cars and fire baseball .
for example , people liked the people in the 11th of the year that was so released .
in the first eight centuries of this tradition , the big thing that &apos;s the great thing in this tradition , god and prices .
by new and more attractive instruments , the age of the donor .
but one question is : what happens when the music stops ?
michael &apos;s thomas : music and feelings in the course of time
so we &apos;re at the beginning of a new design system .
until the year 1945 , they brought it on 100,000 year .
so i &apos;m going to talk about the most important , although i don &apos;t know where i should start .
wow , a volunteer , great !
but recently , my interest was looking at a new view of a big view , because there are conditions where these things can really make a cool thing .
well , i think this is the latest development of a phenomenon that we call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the element of excitement is really the most important thing .
we get amazing talk from you .
let me introduce you to this point of sam .
but even if you &apos;re going to get the screen , there &apos;s a lot more than just words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
as a global innovation , innovation is communicating .
first , i have to take a speaker to a speaker , and talk about what i &apos;m going to give him , instead of saying , instead of saying what i can &apos;t offer .
and that they &apos;re fun to design their own ultimate or worst tedtalk .
well , you can &apos;t compare them to each other .
they hold them alive and give them the sugar , so a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind
this kind of tests are doing this , ok ?
somebody asked &quot; why ? &quot;
the thought he could reverse the waves . couldn &apos;t it .
i think there are three big changes , and that &apos;s in the areas transparency , choice and accountability where people have a real power .
how do we do that ?
my favorite , sharon , and i said , &quot; all over the world , more photos of your head , &quot; as any other one .
11 of 14 countries .
and secondly , teachers looked at the most powerful and more sophisticated than a more friendly way , because they took a specific sense of the way that a sense of sense is .
so i wish all of a beautiful weekend .
dna to read and write , will always be easier and cheaper .
and the senior work alone .
now you might ask yourself , &quot; what would i do in a computer system ? &quot;
if you have this whole world , this can lead to a more powerful , which allows you to do biotechnology .
the kingdom said his laws allow him to be foreign , or the most powerful risk , which is a economic risk or a risk of health care or a risk of health care or the values .
these laws are a blow to the face for science and the science and ignorance and an 11-year-old of traditions and an selective of traditions and a selective .
why are you going to be pregnant when you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of 10 of the people who inject drugs that inject drugs .
so social social , the condoms of endangered , not even the police , is being influenced by the police , or randomly , or randomly , randomly .
here were children born , people died there .
office for personal work are now obsolete .
they have gone out the high line , the road , the river below the street , and you get from a end of the end to the other , without cross the most powerful .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny apartments . &quot;
also jobs should be shared .
their liver makes oil oil .
and they killed about 12,000 sharks at the time by actually just a more powerful of the world &apos;s population in the bay bay bay .
we know very little about them .
so this tag finds the place of a shark , depending on time and the sunset , the water water and deep .
let &apos;s look at the sixth , which has been doing what to do with the genes that are passed from the parents , then we see that basking sharks , compared to the first study , a half less diversity than others .
so , the kind of thing that is that research and found out that the size is about 9,000 .
and what was okay . we got wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build it . &quot;
so if we can see the gender of the shark before we take a sample , we can say the geneticists , if they were from a male or female .
so i decided to give myself the chief .
their body will be cut with the most powerful and they &apos;re used to be used for any of the things to make money -- people tell a lot of these stories .
no business with no one .
my journalism may not fit on other continents or in other countries , in my part of africa , but it &apos;s going to work in the way that people are immediately , ask people immediately , &quot; where are the evidence ?
aa thank you .
i was raised in downtown manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks away from the computer of the world &apos;s population .
i wouldn &apos;t read as a computer scientist .
and had these people ever hit their own victim of their own ?
today , you can be in 29 states , in more than half of the country , because of its sexuality .
and i was in some point , i think , &quot; gay &quot; to photograph the gay , because there was a million different types of gay .
at least i hope that it will be harder to make your human rights .
first , the world is , and it &apos;s always going to contain good and evil , because good and evil , yin and yang , the most important .
and thirdly , i had access to all 1,000 images that had made the soldiers .
on three ways , the conventional way is called .
this is stanley , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he said , &quot; could the holocaust happen , here , and now ? &quot;
&quot; my lord , who is responsible when it happens to something ? &quot;
stanley , and i was closed both of the way , by the way , the high school , the most of the time in the bronx .
here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
the other thing . the self &apos;s self .
alexander &apos;s saying that the border between good and evil is about the heart of one human .
and i hired the experiment at the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what everybody could do , &quot; no big thing to jump on the tracks .
it &apos;s a mystery that really was really hard to make .
we have a self .
but on my left retina , a computer company is a little bit of a , which is the red arrow .
there &apos;s only one reference reference , which is the body .
i promise that i &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s supposed to be a little bit of it .
and the autobiographical self has extended memory , thinking creativity and language .
thank you . thank you for the sleeping hill -- and the aerodynamic hill .
now i &apos;m telling you this -- i &apos;m telling you , and i &apos;m going to make it ridiculous , because i think feminism has partly the task , admit , the aesthetics , and beauty and fun .
we don &apos;t want a hero .
you can see , i don &apos;t put myself in fire .
she talked about the most violent , she founded the computer , she organized her , she &apos;s organized friends -- all these daily actions of care and creativity .
i mean that it &apos;s this perception that &apos;s different the homo sapiens of former .
in fact , this is a sensor for the very , which is the electric activity in my brain , while i think that talk .
we &apos;re going to be a lot of prototypes and products to live with thoughts that can control with thoughts , like civic appliances , or a floating chair .
the headset is wireless with a ipad or smartphone .
as these kids can use their new consciousness to their recovery , many of the harmful and social social systems are turning up , which are diagnosed with people who are diagnosed with the other , to see .
they understood the power of human narrative and that the value we &apos;re doing on people is changing , and it &apos;s growing .
and said , &quot; how are you going to celebrate ? &quot;
my skills and my possibilities .
temporary , and very unexpected , they gave them .
this is not what i thought was about to study my eyes .
i went to a track that i know good .
and very slowly , it happened .
i didn &apos;t really believe myself , not really , not all the tips of me , all the little of us in all of us .
this is me . my whole thing i .
what we have is exactly the same thing that &apos;s the same activity , but it &apos;s going to feel great , and in the other , with just one small change in the posture , you feel terrible .
but i think it &apos;s another debate that has to be the way that we have to get the level of control , which we have about our tax systems .
for the percent of this money , you could have install the trains in the trains , which would not have reduced the duration of the journey , but what the pleasure and the manifestation of the manifestation would have improved more .
i &apos;m not asking the full amount of the one of the other things .
sometimes the lines are very , very long .
i think the danger of the world is the world &apos;s field that the field of economics is being understood as a human psychology .
would have the average answer to 50 to 60 percent .
it will be you that you don &apos;t get yourself yourself , else else .
yay !
they &apos;re 20 , 30 years .
but that didn &apos;t mean that i have a coin with head on both sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but that &apos;s our skin of the visible universe .
thank you .
and with hyperscore , we had fair , actually very strong effects at children around the world , and now in humans , every age of age .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful , which wants to live forever .
hello . my name is dan &apos;s . i &apos;m 34 years old and have cerebral pathways .
this is actually the score of dan &apos;s piece that he wrote completely in hyperscore .
odysseus said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do a little bit of a computer .
there &apos;s first time that there &apos;s the present self .
i have to write five pages a day for articles , or i had to give up five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that today , that &apos;s going to work . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you is the last one of the time that i &apos;m going to have to do with hal , which i &apos;ve been doing with hal , which was introduced to me by my co-author in a previous project , bill xiaoping .
it &apos;s pretty good that it doesn &apos;t affect people , because if one of the faces smiles , the other face is going to be missing .
this is one of the reasons that we &apos;re doing for western science , math and the most important , actually in the first few centuries of our world &apos;s most powerful , and the first few centuries of our own , and the most powerful .
x is the unknown , because it &apos;s not &quot; sh &quot; .
so it &apos;s not surprising that if you talk about mental illness , you probably suffer stories of the other , shame and discrimination in almost all of the life .
something more than 30 years ago , the nations of the world in the world were in the world and gave these legendary explanation .
what is it going on ?
if you look at the level of species , you &apos;ve heard about fish .
you see this profit , you see that almost 8,000 of these dollars are actually subsidies .
that was in the early 1940s , as india wanted to drive a lot of time -- as a means to the drive -- to china , after the time , after the other , nine , 10 percent , and asked , why can &apos;t we look at that ?
it &apos;s not going to make you happy , but you have the trust and the courage , and you say , &quot; we have calculated . &quot;
green carbon , so the emissions through deforestation and agriculture , and blue carbon form 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it .
i didn &apos;t know what these things are doing , dick , not -- sydney by the way .
i also liked this intellectual , intellectual .
and he said he had basically had the same relationship to his father .
there was a theory .
he did it in 1968 .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t move in the course of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed the whole thing , and the most amazing color , which is hidden that fantastic aluminum aluminum .
many of these ideas are dominated by the trailer for airstream .
if you think about it , your children are going to be to send the tinkering school , you &apos;ll come back with the , and you get back to the .
but let &apos;s play them under their own conditions , and trust me , they &apos;re going to learn things that they can &apos;t learn from the most powerful of the world &apos;s disease .
if you want to throw back next time , you don &apos;t want to do it .
i think that &apos;s all . this is number five . okay .
so here you see the sick knee on the left , and here my wife at walking today , four months after , in aspen , and in good constitution .
how about a completely powerful thing , not just the parts ?
this is one of the seven times more powerful , which is not all the time .
and so it came to buy the last time in the years of the world , to buy thousands , then hundreds and then millions of individual individuals , and then millions of individual individuals , to print a middle of hell in the sky .
but how does our imagination work ?
but we never think about the hidden connections .
as a edison light bulb , she saw about this .
you have to be quite smart , and even though i don &apos;t have a college , it doesn &apos;t mean that i &apos;m stupid , because you can &apos;t be stupid , and it &apos;s going to bring it far .
they literally have the door of the door .
if you listen to the most powerful , you hear both the ears both of your speakers .
we have the problem that the antenna is going to be down .
so thank you .
i &apos;m particularly interested in the systems , and i &apos;m interested in systems .
recently , i created some pretty sophisticated things from the computer of the football of the football of the football .
and i drew her own special map , and i wrote her name , you &apos;re going to blow up and sent them up .
i &apos;m sure i can see how you &apos;re going to be a little bit of the time .
and i &apos;m convinced that it &apos;s a lot of time , my valuable and limited life on this earth , and it &apos;s exactly the same thing that &apos;s going on .
in this mode , he tries to keep his position .
i thought i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about how nature creates materials .
and we think about future technologies . we start at the beginning of the world .
and if you look at it , you see the amino acids with the most powerful , where they have different charges .
and through a sequence of the world , you can get a billion fish , which is what you want to do , like a battery or a solar cell .
in this case , you can get out of the way .
if you ask people the question , where do you go to do something important ?
i sat on my desk , i &apos;ve used my expensive computer .
what happens -- sometimes you have this days where you &apos;re in the morning , or to seven or when you &apos;re standing up , and you &apos;re going to say , &quot; man , i didn &apos;t sleep good .
in the office , most of the people are the most sophisticated and distractions that people actually stop from work .
we all know that it &apos;s true . they would never experience a spontaneous meeting that &apos;s going to be a staff of employees .
and the other meetings and managers are the two main problems in companies , especially in offices .
maybe every two weeks , or every week , once the week , the week , the week , where nobody can talk .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m going to do this seven years and have no idea how the future will look .
but if you ask people to ask the three most important things that they &apos;re wearing , no matter what culture and what the relationship -- most people say , key , money , and if they have one , the most important , money , and if they have one , the mobile phone , and if they have one , the mobile phone , and if they have one , the mobile phone , and if they have one , the mobile phone , and if they have one , the mobile phone , and if they have
but , this is a very big but , we have the tendency to forget .
now , i want to give you an practical example of delegation .
they take 10 or 20 percent of the day , and then the owner of the church takes 10 or 20 percent of the store , and there &apos;s a lot of the amount of the way in the bar .
it challenges the norm .
and he somehow has a recognition of the values of the ocean .
at the same time , the spread of this mobile devices are seeing a expectation of availability .
our present reality is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell you later about it .
what are we talking about ?
dean ornish shares us new research research , which shows how the defenders are going to affect healthy lifestyles , and he says , &quot; well , if we &apos;re healthier life , better food , exercise , and more love , are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to reproduce and love more , and they
until i tell you who it said .
within this context , we can obviously feel regret about many different things .
when i went home after i had my tattoo , i stayed almost the whole night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s another fifth .
i mean , even the stupid answer to all of the time can let us go back to the ted .
and as i used to say , i &apos;m a more powerful .
i thought i &apos;d try to do my ted wish , and i would try to do what i &apos;m trying to do , and how this fits to what they &apos;re trying to do .
no in india . now at least one million active active .
and i was thinking that someone in this whole way of thinking about the organization of the world &apos;s organization has to think about the organization of the world .
and so we did that , to do that .
listen to that : less than four tenth of a percent that were treated , the more , they stopped their medicines or their treatment , and their treatment .
it &apos;s a try and i think it would be successful .
the g20 are not a mile .
if the divine is used , it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity , day and night .
and people bring their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , with the green school .
the local women from bali cooking is eating food on the food and they use secrets that just know their grandmothers .
we need somebody who &apos;s coming and studying it .
the green school is a model that we built for the world .
my tongue , voice and vocal , were healthy and not cut . &quot;
then apple alex brought out , the best voice i &apos;ve heard about .
there was a reason for that : that was me .
the most important thing is , of course , not .
but it &apos;s not about it .
at first , the internet was a little bit of a tool for me , and now it &apos;s something that i &apos;m going to leave for my real , daily life .
it &apos;s human , to ignore disease .
they all know the test for artificial intelligence , the test test .
i was a architect , and i asked my grandmother once , &quot; what do you live ? &quot;
we treat two of these sites as a single side , because it &apos;s like the readers .
so what is the lesson behind it ?
but one day , my grandmother said , &quot; no , it &apos;s going to go to it .
it &apos;s happened and terrible things happened with me .
all lost hope in my cure .
so they went to their own and all they collected their own furniture -- they gave me a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the furniture , and they were going to be able to get out of the way , and they were doing it .
you don &apos;t know how far away this road is and you don &apos;t know if you go straight and you hear cars and you hear cars and you have a terrible accident that you &apos;ve brought into this situation .
i thought that some reason that the time was left , and only for family and friends .
for example , the understanding of molecular structures .
he took me to the most violent of the world &apos;s most powerful .
can we argue we &apos;ve discovered all the symmetries of the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t turn it out because i have a little barrier of a little bit of a way , right ?
if i cut a magic train and then a , it makes a third .
galois has set up a series of laws for how these tables , these symmetries , interact .
so , this is a symmetry called us a lot of the symmetry .
instead of all the mess , i want to know how many digits have the number . ok ?
i need your final . symmetrical objects basically have -- please spell it for me .
first , worse diet , maybe shorter food .
thomas edison had been in a software software of today &apos;s very much more powerful .
penicillin was discovered , but even in 1940 , there were no commercial and a medical useful amount of useful amounts of it .
it was the origin of the most popular year , the last year , his 50 birthday .
for me , the lesson of unintended consequences is that chaos is now happening . let &apos;s do the best thing .
working on every computer and browser . minus , minus , minus , minus and the text will be smaller .
it doesn &apos;t need to delete the extra .
and so a kind of information system that i &apos;m inspired by , my real desk .
a means about it would be like a kind of a more powerful , so you get the more traditional desktop , and the things are in the grid .
now i get to my music of the heart of people and there &apos;s no limits .
but i think the point is , it &apos;s metaphors with bite , and with such a bite , i want to suggest that we &apos;re a little bit of the role of contemporary math , not just the way that we &apos;re going to rethink the role of contemporary math .
and he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s 2,000 physicists in wall street and i &apos;m one of them . &quot;
you can find them here : this is a book about flies that may have been on amazon .
these are not a lot of time ; that &apos;s culture .
you can do it very , very far .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s actually so interesting .
go ahead . shake . louder !
i want to tell you a secret .
so , intersections without traffic pressure , so with stop , many lives , but there &apos;s a very much more likely to get them .
the answer is to allow cars to get the road of the road .
warren buffet had this thought , honestly , to say what works and what &apos;s not going to do and do this .
in fact , we see the most famous disease that is the only known disease because of the living people in africa have been living in africa .
this means that the economy in these areas are going to be able to be able to be able to do it as much .
but that &apos;s not a more likely one .
not just it was weak ; she &apos;s going to be comfortable .
a teacher of the upper neighborhood will be the performance of his class -- measured in a year to increase 10 percent .
but it &apos;s not a relationship to it , a better teacher .
&quot; what happens here ? &quot;
and these free courses couldn &apos;t only be available in the internet , but you can also make dvds all available to a lot of access to a very large teacher that can have the best teachers .
traditional vessels , like this cup , need eight to 10 hours to burn .
the sculptor richard serra talks about how he thought he was a young artist , he was a painter and he lived in the high school .
if i look at these photographs , i &apos;m going to go back to my clothes as i went home at the night .
my parents were great . they said , &quot; we know you &apos;re afraid , but let &apos;s just go tomorrow .
but is it so bad to keep us so powerful ?
this is a general rate of general in boston .
the caregiver takes the sample , it &apos;s a , it &apos;s a , and it &apos;s going to be done under the microscope and then informed the operating room .
so in this kind of thing , a solution to these incidents of these incidents , together with a volcanic , and there &apos;s green , and it &apos;s a green , and it can &apos;t separate the molecules of a cancer cancer , normal tissue can &apos;t separate these molecules .
with the of the nodes , as part of our own , the surgeon is looking for the one of the individuals who start the nodes , where the cancer begins .
if nerves are damaged , they can cause the cube , and pain .
if we &apos;re going to get these two samples ...
we know that this is doable and we &apos;re determined to realize this .
and this cell is one of the thousand different types of things that we learn .
it will affect the healthy circuits as well as the ill that they want to fix .
and one morning in the summer , we tried to do it and it &apos;s been working on the first time .
we &apos;ve shown that already a short media of these cells are enough to make learning .
and it &apos;s going . now .
i want to end with a story of the process that we think it might be clinical application .
now you can see that the animal actually goes to the walls and go to the little platform and can use his eyes .
buildings are the inevitable microbes in the air , which is through the windows of the window and over mechanical , and mechanical .
and if you &apos;re going out , the air contains microbes that are associated with the general and the dirt .
obviously , i &apos;m a physical person , as you see , so i didn &apos;t have a worry that 20 blocks are far to wear this thing .
the same thing is true for the question , who was in september september the streets of the streets in my neighborhood ?
and you can get a list .
one of these things i &apos;ve been experimenting with is something called google sharing , basically you just take a abstract term and search in google after that , and then you look at this results after someone .
this is star agency . i mean , ok , interesting .
if you have the second side here , most of the people .
what was normal for us , and that &apos;s what &apos;s normal about stories between generations -- now , rarely .
in 1939 , the film is older than most grandparents of our members .
was the story good ?
why don &apos;t we see that with the same passion like reading ?
in california , they &apos;re sent to a parallel : &quot; this product contains chemicals that are the state of california as a cause of cancer , and the other thing is , &quot; and other people &apos;s own . &quot;
so maybe we might be able to develop a more powerful , the humility requires . and for my profession as an architect , it &apos;s a bad thing that words &quot; miss , &quot; &quot; &quot; humility &quot; and &quot; architect &quot; since &quot; the eternal source &quot; no longer in the same heel .
i don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was : &quot; the stone age ended not because we &apos;re coming out of the stones . &quot;
and that can be very fine for berlin , but we were going to be built in houston , and all the windows are closed . and with all the products that obviously didn &apos;t have to use for the use of the use of the use , it &apos;s actually a vertical kind of a vertical system .
if we look at the word competition , i &apos;m sure most of you are using it .
since we &apos;ve been able to have the 4,000 most common most common in a database that we &apos;re going to put in six weeks of public .
now we have 160 pounds of heavy foreign foreign the internet in the internet .
we started to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
and this is the most powerful thing in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . let &apos;s tell you about nobody that we knew that all of that , because we didn &apos;t know .
for example , they &apos;re going to be in microsoft at the 11th of microsoft at 9 / 11 , and then the other , the other , google , clarity , apple , apple and so on .
i chose sweden because sweden is similar laws , like the united states .
and who also tells you , he didn &apos;t have to hide it for a long time .
their email were read and she talked to the most popular and said , &quot; if there &apos;s no right on privacy , there can &apos;t be a real speech , and that &apos;s why no effective democracy can be . &quot;
many people , if you see a fresh human brain , say , &quot; normally it looks different , if you get a brain . &quot;
all these empty areas , are the areas where the aral phone goes through .
and the nature of a particular cell , to basically power , is also able to make it , which is the 25,000 genes , and what the threshold are on the front of it .
now experts come into the game and make basic junk .
we take this material and put it on a so-called one called a so-called .
so what can scientists learn from this data ?
you look at your entire genome and you try to find the world &apos;s genome , which is linked to the genes .
whether that &apos;s the individual genetic background or your experience , we don &apos;t know .
that we know how we can eradicate poverty , we need to only do more for it ?
so here &apos;s a few more questions .
how can you know ?
so what is the problem ?
well , before it was all right .
and it was made many experiments that came to the same result , so i &apos;m just going to tell you about one .
so what is the best ?
we need this kind of information . we need more of it , and we need to drive politics .
and maybe we start small , with things where we &apos;re sure they &apos;re working .
poverty is more distorted than scientific work , and a lack of data about the impact of the impact of the impact of the way that you &apos;re going to get this one , but the fact that the damage -- and the damage of the way that damage -- with help , and what damage -- with help .
so we start , because africa is , in a certain way , in the world &apos;s brain .
and the legend reported that alexander went through this desert .
but you could say , &quot; invest in africa with 1,000 languages , and it would not move . &quot;
so let &apos;s look at the countries , and the specific materials and data .
i want to talk to this of the area of capital capital .
in tanzania , last week of the standard of the standard of the standard of the standard , the standard was called the life .
if i have to ask you , &quot; what was in 2005 in 2005 , the world &apos;s best performance ? &quot;
because there are fascinating possibilities .
&quot; god &quot; is the journey that we all want to be inspired and feel with a universe , which is life .
you &apos;re going to take a switch -- there &apos;s electric light .
i don &apos;t know why , but it thought it .
i &apos;m going to run that , so you can take it somehow and i &apos;m going to describe my reactions when i saw this first time .
right .
ok , take it , raise the right hand .
kt : yeah .
kt : no , no . i just see the street .
i couldn &apos;t see through the blindfold .
again , away .
kb : how often did you feel that ?
let &apos;s close your eyes , in five , four , three , two , one .
just if you want the pressure to cut down , you make a more powerful , so , but only if you want the pressure to cut down .
do you want to try it ?
you feel a certain emotion , and if you feel the emotion , i want you to throw the water into the bottle .
there &apos;s one thing that i want to share with you .
ready ?
my hand is , here , in the world , in the world .
kb : ok . do you think it &apos;s here , yes or no ?
first of all , keith barry , like our brain can be our bodies -- with a trick of the fact that it works with a trick , and then he refers to the audience in some amazing moves of brain magic .
i &apos;m going to be a lot of time .
this is not for the one of four . this is for all four .
i watched that both religious people are equally obsessed with morality .
the most common is almost zero , if there &apos;s no stimulation to the inner .
they get the message of the computer , &quot; person 1 has sent them this amount of money .
we showed that the gift of oxytocin is the generosity of oxytocin to be 80 percent .
i just found the molecule .
he asked me , &quot; what should we do ? &quot;
in experiments we have men to give testosterone testosterone .
that tells us that we invented this ritual to connect us with this new few emotional .
and it &apos;s very easy to engage a brain to the most important .
to get the device to run , you need a lot of people .
or should you not be about it ?
they were very focused on , &quot; you &apos;ve given us a device that works only on english . so we taught ourselves to be english so we can use it . &quot;
i decided to destroy my own argument by making a very comfortable statement .
absurd . but i had to follow the victorian norm .
how is the morning ?
we need to turn this imbalance to pleasure , to pleasure .
i think it &apos;s the focus here .
i asked a very incredible question -- &quot; when was the beginning of the world ? how will you end ? &quot;
and only one last thing .
maybe we should go to the next piece , because i just lost the plumber .
he went to the local of the local pradesh in uttar pradesh and found that he was running in the official papers as dead .
so this area is the field of the field .
and the quantitative layer is in the privileged layer that is able to pay several of the pieces and to lead several households , common .
after these four children , you see younger sister , who are following their children who were killed .
and finally , there was a single one that was sitting for me , and later his participation had to climb up , so i had to get him to the street , so he &apos;s got a lot of time .
with 16 , the kids have to leave the orphanage , even though they can &apos;t go anywhere .
one of the interesting things is of course the combination of naked hand , and the technology , and of course , what he said about the listening of our young people .
now my career could continue to continue .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
from him , the sound comes through the atlantic atlantic .
or we do this , and we think that &apos;s what blindness is .
rain . not bad . not bad .
individual is the more sophisticated thing , but why can &apos;t i do that if i learn a piece of music ?
in this way , the dove is showing the dove of the dove , and the dove of the slope of the music is a lot more than sound , and to make a sound sound on its eardrum .
and it was so big until the point of where it was a last year in the last year , and rick , and rick , &quot; millions of people in television . &quot;
but that &apos;s not the interesting thing about it .
cp : you &apos;ve been lucky to transmit it to you .
peace and love were mentioned .
cp : yeah , but you still don &apos;t know what you should think about .
this is 10 times longer than mammals needed to reach their maximum size and to make all these habitats .

you &apos;re going to go in , there &apos;s only four strands of dna , and you sit in your own building , which can be put on other blocks when you fit .
we have a very sophisticated computer program where little changes -- tiny , individual mutations -- something that created a square of a size , and something much larger .
and they used calculations , and they &apos;re to understand and get it better in the handle , as feynman said , we have to build something to understand it .

because we did something right , and it would be good to figure out what it is .
they want the most powerful .
if not , one of the two people are going to be , right ?
the developing world used soap and water , immunization .
and now i have the most popular thing on this axis .
and they remember the beginning of the last century , which was very bad . until that so-called a big leap after the bottom .
do you see how you grow ? and how hundreds of millions of millions of people in asia are coming out of poverty ?
here we are . we have a continuity in the world .
look . this is the world .
they get clean water . they buy food for the poor . they &apos;re going to be malaria .
and we need to look at the way we look at the world with facts .
don &apos;t do it quite africa . don &apos;t do it .
it &apos;s not sustainable . and it &apos;s not going to happen to a superpower .
and many of you have heard the term &quot; memes &quot; , the evolution of technology is something that i &apos;m very much paying attention to , so you know , one of the first objects you had was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
my argument is basically that , well , the way that we &apos;ve been doing is the way that we &apos;ve been doing our lives .
and that &apos;s pretty new , and i think it &apos;s going to be much worse -- this possibility -- because of developments in information technology , in the information technology , in the world &apos;s information , as biotechnology or nanotechnology .
i do my best , okay .
&quot; the &quot; the &quot; is our favorite &quot; means &quot; he &apos;s saved the people &apos;s people , &quot; what was a pretty sophisticated thing to do .
we only have civil wars in six countries that are going to report the media just over six countries .
so , should we put our money together ?
none of these countries , including africa &apos;s nation , including botswana , has ever been the percentage of the percentage .
and as this development we were , africans , in the edge of development , and they &apos;re putting out of politics in our countries .
the pursuit of the world is mostly the most common , cost of the billion .
we &apos;d like to interview them . &quot; and i said , &quot; great . &quot;
and now 14 of the diseases are executed , two of them even more of them .
and in the last 10 years , and as hope for the future , we saw the beginnings of a science of positive psychology : a science of what life makes .
and i think there are three different -- and i call them different , because they &apos;re in different interventions reasons , it &apos;s possible to have a different one -- three different happy lives .
but it turns out that there was no sexual trauma .
you don &apos;t see how to get a lot of the time .
and what you find is that if you do something fun , the most fun thing is .
when i was more susceptible to 30 years ago , i thought , if i was good enough to make someone depressed , not afraid , not angry that i would make it happy .
a polar bear , which is floating in the arctic , taken by paul .
but this so-called &quot; snapshot &quot; when all parts of the parts are all together and not just the event , but also my emotional connection to it .
nick -- again with a automatic camera -- has thousands of photos of this .
sometimes you can tell a rich story about focused on it .
we also want to find solutions .
and then somehow all of you go and jump .
thank you .
what &apos;s more important is that this is a very powerful process that you can capture in only three seconds : we can be emily in a period of less than one afternoon in a few different types of different types of different types of water and the most powerful .
emily : image metrics is a computer company , a lot of time , a lot of time .
finally , i became involved in it .
in the reserve , there &apos;s a few beautiful primates .
but i was made from the west and worked in the east .
all over the world , all of the time were broken , animals killed , the forest , and so on .
here &apos;s bpa broken , and gold .
one day we met with the most powerful .
the elephant just , and they took the most powerful .
i don &apos;t think somebody can be able to be able to be able to be able to do that , because google makes the right , even if people use google google to connect .
kary ghonim : a hero of the congo of congo
we have , almost without having it , from a market market to a market market .
they don &apos;t have to pay it from their budget .
i should educate them , what happened with these experiments .
democracy doesn &apos;t need perfect equality , but it takes citizens that share a common life .
and the u.s. as a leading nation in 1900 , because where the line is going to change red .
we have this gift in the &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s , when women are in the world .
electricity was also helpful at the civilian of women .
a amazing fact for the most important thing is that in the first half of the 20th century , the improvement of life expectancy is three times so fast as in the second half of the 19th century .
that was the paper i was doing with 11 years and i got a two + .
i have some , which thought , &quot; five and 15 should be my favorite , and that led to a sense of failure .
so if i look at creativity , i think , is this sense or the inability to be able to be able to be able to be able to see the connections that i see between virtually everything in life .
that &apos;s what buddhist fishermen say because they &apos;re actually not killing creatures .
and they &apos;re going to notice it more often .
and i had to find what to do , what &apos;s going on to the story .
how are we going to be the responsibility , what the responsibility and the causes are outside of a dish ?
and they have to be in all possibilities , including that i &apos;ve never seen before .
i hope you can see me when i &apos;m going to be able to do this examples , because i actually talk about everything you could spend your time .
now there &apos;s magazines about water .
people pay the full price for both , and the only thing they have in common is that they have nothing together .
the corners of the corners , on the middle of the way that &apos;s the big market .
these guys are asking the most powerful of the world .
but you don &apos;t have to be a little bit more powerful -- you don &apos;t have to be completely a lot of time .
so what you need to do is to figure out who it &apos;s interested .
nine months later , i was going to be messages on tahrir square . reason was a picture that i saw in my favorite room .
thank you .
mostly the cultural legacy is in us , looking at the past and the past .
my first documentary for national geographic , which i realized , you can put environmental problems in a documentary about the story of nature , i had dedicated to the story of nature .
these are the lions and tigers of the ocean .
and because i love sharks -- i &apos;m sort of obsessed with you -- i wanted to do another , more positive story about sharks to talk about the need of protection .
after i had been left , i had been able to make that habitat is going to be a new kind of habitat to create a new kind of thing .
they also get out of the way .
but when the fish came back and back and the population of the population , forests grew up in the flat water , forests of non-zero-sumness in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water , in the flat water
now , it lives in the jungle of the jungle , and this is a little bit of a time , and this is the second son , by the way , the son of the second orangutans i saved , the son i saved .
it was a biological desert .
then you see the returns and start measuring what comes out .
so how do we break this cycle ?
and you need bacteria to crack the nitrogen , and without these microorganisms , it &apos;s not going to be a performance .
the humidity is 10 percent higher .
so we can really change climate .
in the world , it &apos;s the inspiring , there &apos;s a democratic culture , so you can use the law to protect your system .
the most prolific of the grim , which is a a pristine on a computer company .
i &apos;ll show you one .
and the most powerful thing is , the more powerful sculpture , beautiful works , the pattern of the pattern , or moving the waves , and in nine minutes , he &apos;s going to be inspired by his favorite art -- at the same time , by mathematics and nature .
every city has her own design .
23 years later , you asked us to come and connect this idea .
this is the italian portal , the southwest park , the most popular park , the japanese space , the german park .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
either it doesn &apos;t exist or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or anything , but no case of science .
people always say that consciousness is hard to define .
you can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in the existence of your consciousness .
it &apos;s a digital computer program in the brain and to create consciousness , we need to find the right program .
we &apos;re constantly bringing the objectivity and the kind of reality of reality and as a properties of the brain .
... don &apos;t you find ?
but i also meet people who do what they do , love , and they can &apos;t imagine to make something else .
we don &apos;t teach american history in britain .
teenagers don &apos;t wear any horror .
maybe later , not immediately .
no , don &apos;t do it .
i couldn &apos;t get this thing to work , no matter how often or how much i &apos;m going to do .
but we need to change from a industrial model to a computer model , which is the morning every single school .
and i wanted to figure out more about it .
the reason that the historical report is called the historical report in the speed of the speed .
and she was a light on it . she said , &quot; okay , it &apos;s serious .
she led a group of students in a protest in the streets of a protest .
i was on , made a tea , sat down and i &apos;m here , and i &apos;m here -- still paralyzed , but here .
so peace direct , so you can get the back .
he wrote a book called &quot; from the &quot; the &quot; of the &quot; the &quot; of the &quot; with a computer of the &quot; with a computer . &quot;
it &apos;s not like this , it &apos;s not a kind of a kind of a bit of a time .
in fact , chris was worried , and he said , &quot; look , show you this photograph , you &apos;re not going to think that you &apos;re still a of these crazy modern artists that don &apos;t make a lot of it . &quot;
it &apos;s a object for the spirit .
and the solution i &apos;m going to do is that the biggest self is in this massive world of the earth through humanity and the destruction of the biosphere .
so i said , &quot; what would t be from the counter -- we call it a little bit of the way they &apos;re going to get the effects , where they &apos;re going to get the impact , and we call it the impact of where they &apos;re going to get the effects ? &quot;
and he was a huge kind of a big amount of water on the market that has increased our revenues and profit .
we literally won the most powerful .
but five days later , in atlanta , i got an email from glenn thomas , one of my people from the meeting in california .
so , frankly , many of us are afraid that the industry works in the industry that the industry is threatened by technology and perhaps the most powerful .
and really , we need somebody to convey somebody to give us a experience with a mentally divine ?
the arts , whatever you do , store us every time you put us , and to look at our own , and to look at our own , and curiosity .
the three sisters ahn with her passionate music , a new life , is a new life , and at tedwomen , they start with the happy and the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; of david &quot; from david &apos;s .
the manchester ridge is named after my quarter .
he makes a bunch of money through the machine of the way for rich people .
we &apos;ve taken the curriculum of the american , which is in their sense of harvard , and we &apos;re going to be a more powerful for mothers in the middle of the city , and we &apos;re in the middle of the city in the middle of the city .
we &apos;ve noticed that you have to give flowers and the sunlight and food and expectations and the expectations and so you can cure the spiritual cancer .
these kids who were given up the world from the world , which is going to fly from public schools , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re capable of , with affection and sunlight and the good music and confidence and the good music and confidence .
and it &apos;s been working on today .
and i &apos;m going to allow you to take the concert , and i &apos;ll give you the music . and you &apos;ve ever been able to sell them to sell you a agreement , you have to sign the money to support the money of school . &quot;
this is a space of nancy wilson built the album in our school last christmas .
the brown building , which is you watching you and i tell you where i made my greatest mistake .
he came to me . he said , &quot; man , that &apos;s a fabulous story .
and so he has a group of people .
bill frames tells a calm and amazing story of redemption through art , music and unusual alliance .
and the final thing then brings the world &apos;s office to the brain , and the result is a little bit of a the way that produces a normal , a normal amount of a normal .
but there was the most popular factor , the problem with the code , and how to make cells better to make normal reactions , and that was our contribution .
she cover us with a invisible , a invisible , the attacks of the environment , so we remain healthy .
but if bacteria grow and double and double all of this , they &apos;re going to make these molecules , then the number of molecules outside the cell is going to be able to be able to get rid of the cell .
now we know that all bacteria can talk to each other .
this is just a photograph -- a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very .
bacteria are incredibly powerful , which is coming back to that , that we kill antibiotics with antibiotics .
the fact is that bacteria have a collective behavior and they meet tasks that they could never do when they &apos;re only acting as individuals .
it &apos;s a big honor to get to this conference .
or the first one that comes in the room .
but , if we think about justice , aristotle , which we need to think about , is the actual character of the most important activity and qualities that are worth that you &apos;re going to be able to get them to the , and behold .
what a reason would you have ?
charlie , what do you say to warren ?
here it is , as he &apos;s doing .
so aristotle has been with flutes , and the wheel of the day of the marriage &apos;s marriage is right .
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic debate
many people said , &quot; well , you know , you don &apos;t have a rural , you don &apos;t have to say , &quot; well , we &apos;re going to do that with our time .
and i think that &apos;s good -- the future humanity can make a decision .
so if that &apos;s what &apos;s called this ?
i &apos;m saying the speed of the world &apos;s speed is going to be .
i &apos;m saying that &apos;s nonsense .
we know that there are this threshold because we don &apos;t get a data of a age before we get a age of age , and that even though the damage has been the damage for our birth .
that means you have to make your homework to understand whether this is true .
audience : hi . i &apos;ve read that in the last 20 years , the average lifespan of virtually every one on the planet has spread 10 years .
not one of their media has done this .
we don &apos;t care how we make our profit .
they were in the center of the center of the world , and they put the agenda on the agenda .
but i can &apos;t present a more sophisticated , which is the most important thing that i have from economists , and i &apos;ve learned to learn from economists , epidemiologists and environmental institutions .
the most scary thing is something scary , and probably you know a part of the most powerful .
14 americans die a day at asthma , who three times like in the &apos; 90s , and almost everything comes from the world &apos;s .
he apparently had sense of humor .
politicians and the most fear of fear is to be scared of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second , because we &apos;ve eradicated them .
so we thought , &quot; let &apos;s try . &quot;
there &apos;s some amazing animals .
immediately , the government said , &quot; enough -- that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to go . &quot; and paid people to do it , every single one they saw .
he may think it might have been born the baby &apos;s baby , so he might need a little bit of help from the outside .
i asked peter if something changed . and he said , &quot; no . &quot;
we want to now talk to africa , the next chapter , and that &apos;s it : a healthy , beautiful , beautiful african .
but especially you have to be productive in your life , and create a kind of productive environment in our countries so that things can be done .
we can connect this all ?
we were on the side of the world &apos;s side .
i had to crawl through the legs of these people , with my sister on my back to find a window .
you know , we need to use everything good .
and often i don &apos;t see african employees under them .
now the question is , how can we use it from all of this good will that comes from us ?
you &apos;re a little bit of the time . &quot;
we have a lot of the time in nigeria with the most violent .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is effective , i took this case , so i can study it , so we can study it , just like we can study any other complex neurological neurological .
the method has been applied for the 90s to study extremely complex processes .
i want to try to show you this for you briefly .
and then i &apos;m in the control of the control , here , games in change .
now how do you study rap scientifically ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity , rather than being involved in the world &apos;s world .
i want to say , probabilities and statistics , that &apos;s the mathematics of games and the most powerful .
this is very comforting and it &apos;s not pleasant .
but keep the thought of the whole time of eight seconds .
in play and virtual worlds , for example , you can be used , of course , and you can be used to control your facial expressions , and you &apos;re using a avatar to control a avatar or virtual character .
otherwise they &apos;re very fast . and without a stable grid , it &apos;s not possible , so children die .
another statement of esther was that we react to a tragedy like haiti , but this is a kind of a computer .
it &apos;s produced by malaria , and it &apos;s a very interesting substance .
we have every street , every village , almost every square square of madagascar .
in your favorite room , a very cheaper laser is a very cheaper laser .
audience : yeah !
so , interesting , although we have the whole time , we &apos;ve never done it , we never did it , the guards in the air .
this is the restaurant acorn house .
this is the most powerful you see here , actually , in a computer system , which was made from outside and the outside of the outside , and it was been made .
so water is a more important aspect .
&quot; metal &quot; and &quot; earth &quot; are still out .
the idea is not more sophisticated .
they don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
once it touches the water , you should hear how air comes out .
once we sequenced these two genomes , we asked ourselves , if this is the smallest genome of a self , it could be a little bit more likely to be a little bit of a small genome ?
and we realized that we were , once that worked , a real chance of the same way , if we could bring the synthetic chromosomes to the bacteria , the bacteria are going to be the bacteria .
care is the way that it is .
the last finally is a quote from robert feynman : &quot; what i can &apos;t build myself , that can &apos;t understand . &quot;
but actually , we &apos;re going to live in the northwest of the koran , and the actual idea of paradise , the 36 times as &quot; gardens , &quot; and the 36 times , &quot; gardens , &quot; and it &apos;s defined by increasing streams .
but the more you add , the more you lost .
and this number of 72 comes .
this is a nest of a wheels colony and that &apos;s the nest entrance .
this is a colony which has been founded by an queen in the previous summer .
the most important thing -- that &apos;s a magnifying glass -- are an interesting group . they go out early morning , before the first group on the commodity goes to the first group .
and sadly , and interestingly , it looks like half of the colony colony just does nothing .
the nest maintenance maintenance maintenance maintenance workers just take all the nests and bring them to the top edge of the world &apos;s office and put them there .
and the ponds are somehow deciding , not to get rid of .
and we &apos;ve done experiments that show that the longer one ant is out of a ant out , the more the simple suspects on their surface is changing . so that the ants smell different things that they do .
they &apos;re going to go down the entire earth , except antarctica .
here you see that the cost of all the world &apos;s cost of the world is about 89 million barrels of oil , and the annual cost of three trillion dollars .
and we do that for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
it doesn &apos;t have to do that .
i think where we can use natural gas .
and when i cost the natural gas , natural dollars .
why don &apos;t you worry about that ?
so , just 500 million .
it never became the water of water or similar .
tbp : i &apos;ve lost 150 million in the wind , okay ?
some have 5,000 . many have more .
there were a lot of time . and there were a lot of time .
the life is a event . let &apos;s get it the world .
these are work in lower manhattan where you built the first of the first time .
these were in maybe six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to the light bulb .
a friend of mine told me this story : that didn &apos;t just come and wait , but then the most important , but then the most important , when they were there , they had to call someone .
so , sometimes i &apos;m going to use a clinical language , and that &apos;s what it will not be so warm to you as warm as in other conversations about compassion .
and here &apos;s the basic idea that the basic idea of good actions is to be able to do that for people who are going to be .
basically , it &apos;s about if you &apos;re my enemy or my co-author , if you &apos;re not my friend or to my family , i &apos;m much less , the golden rule on you . okay .
and so , the results are going to raise . this is a zero-sum game .
every shape of the graffiti dependence on the other , forces , forces the human rights .
and you &apos;ll explain to you , the other thinking that america doesn &apos;t want them to be able to dominate them and actually dominate them , and they hate america .
most diseases are related to poverty , but in the case of cancer , children who died in cancer , mostly from wealthy families .
a week died a child , but nothing changed .
because you &apos;re not going to apply this kind of energy and time , if it &apos;s not really interested in it .
and that &apos;s why he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
well , the dominant of the dominant , that there &apos;s a single oncogene in a single cell cell , and that these you are doing a single one of the things that you do .
what does that mean ?
we found a kind of a kind of a kind of a little bit of a material that was the right debut , we put the cells in and behold , and behold , in about four days , they were going to see , and you see what we &apos;ve made in a culture .
and of course we &apos;re asking ourselves , where we &apos;re now going to go ?
and so i want to finish with a poem .
we have a little bit of journalists who were caught in the world &apos;s face ; a young boy , whose book contains so many of the sudden quotes , that you &apos;ve taken it out of the shelves ; a scar about fake .
it sounds a little bit like a strange book , but it &apos;s actually about new ways of lying .
he wrote very , very positive , very positive , about themselves . surprise !
you could have a little bit of a person who &apos;s going to be affected by a person .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can lie on it ; used to be talked to them , and then they were continuing .
they said , how big the bathroom was , or said , the most powerful , and so far from the hotel .
and , right there . okay . okay , glass , make a picture !
and also , you want to be able to get your eyes .
but it really has opened my eyes , as often i have been thrown out of life for emails , social networks and so on , even though it really doesn &apos;t really matter or a really important thing .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band of the boat .
and every one that then was going to go to the day , i went back .
at least for me , because if i just do the same thing , i &apos;m very , very boring . i &apos;m very quickly going to be very quickly .
i see myself as ... i don &apos;t know what i see .
will you nervous , the more nervous ?
im : do you worry ? you see so cute .
and i &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s good , but just that it &apos;s not going to be satisfied , ok ?
if you have the eiffel islands too long , it will be buttermilk .
i call it the era of the citizenship -- which people are different , or the other people who are in the other way , but yet as citizens can be all the same same .
in egypt , i &apos;ve been discovered in egypt , of course , .
this had studied in london , was trained in yemen , and it was a plane in amsterdam to attack america .
there are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols that use to democratic culture on the ground .
as an anecdote , we can show that if poverty was the only factor , well , bin laden is a richest family saudi .
what happened there was a political coalition that was a political goal to be a political goal , and that was the leaders to get the leaders .
these tools are only going to be more important if they &apos;re technically boring .
he &apos;s a commodity of the individual networks and they then get a .
and because of social networking , chinese students who studied abroad in foreign , or companies from the rest of the world , had the office in china , there were people all around the world that heard this news .
and finally , the chinese was working through .
we &apos;re always more in media media in the media , social , ubiquitous and cheap .
but all of the time in view , i &apos;m still going to take it as well as i was doing .
in my fourth side of everest , a comet moved over the mountain .
this view is the most important thing up . the first 600 feet of the rise of base camp .
and this is in camp fourth .
and there were climbers on this summit ridge .
we also got the bad news that beck &apos;s edwards , another climbers , in this storm , was collapsed in the snow and died .
it &apos;s so much so much , there &apos;s a lot of work on the top that i sometimes have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
this climbers was a little bit of the climbers .
and i can only be a little bit of a bit of a bit of a sudden , like it did .
and so he &apos;s going to turn back to the following .
these are stressful , the most powerful .
and the fourth thing that is very significant for me is , &quot; ideas , where we have to share . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , through the novelty rise , entrepreneurs were to models . and they &apos;re wearing in great ways to society .
it was the people who wanted to bring democracy , because they bring the ideas to the ideas , from universal , parliament and the constitution and so on .
the third thing is , the cities are again .
the second is the most important thing we have , which is what makes entrepreneurs so difficult , and they &apos;re making a lot of jobs in companies that 93 percent of indian jobs are in the world .
so , if you &apos;re a young country , you have the chance to put a modern , modern , modern , and that you don &apos;t have the most powerful , if you get older .
you have to be a clear strategy , which is important for india and important for the world .
so the government decides to make the government .
even though some people don &apos;t like to hear it in the left , it actually was the revolution of markets that are living in the world , which is the government . &quot;
they &apos;re not afraid of the masses .
so this whole constructive mistrust between the most devastating and the ones that they represent .
and the most powerful .
every one of these most of these are statistically being captured , two years after the most powerful .
david cameron : 20 million pounds in a social social system , &quot; to support this idea .
and the most important thing : investment in social change
i &apos;m working . &quot;
why ? are you too tired to get to the rent ?
even if i &apos;m with my friend called jack , i say , &quot; i &apos;m a doctor , jack , jack . &quot;

and at the time , with this one , i can do my sound , and i &apos;m going to leave my sounds , and let &apos;s repeat .
our people had to try to try to find about 5,000 different types of things to find the right .
don &apos;t hear the ones who say that you can &apos;t do that . everybody can do that .

patient capital is uncomfortable for people who are looking for simple solutions , light categories , because we don &apos;t look at profit as a result .
but the entire community , all different brain rights , also the most different and the most powerful , would sit down and pray . &quot;
because the most important thing , if you &apos;re full of the juice , it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s green , you feed the world , you &apos;re enough to go to the sky . &quot;

he said , &quot; but i understand that . i can understand that .
half of the body was meaningless , the other thing .
this is a kind of a more powerful in the nanoscale , nepal .
i don &apos;t want to do a nice stuff .
there &apos;s a certain kind of treatment , it &apos;s called the way that it &apos;s called the treatment .
it &apos;s not the painting we would have painted , but what we actually painted .
another example : again , a stupid mother .

no , we talk about 10 million , 20 million dollars on the swiss bank bank , on the bank bank in the bank bank , from the presidents , the high wildlife of the president .

it really is a young man out there , and it &apos;s really going to be able to think about certain negative things , and all of this , or any of these , or any of the things that behave .
so , a lot of the time , so much to say , so much time .
i think this is really the theme of this event .
so , you &apos;ve described this as a computer industry of the world .
it &apos;s basically a cd . a cd .
now the art art . oh , that was fantastic .
that was really fantastic .
video games can be very profound , even if they &apos;re completely more powerful .
we &apos;re showing &quot; portal , &quot; because you &apos;re going to take up to walls to create new spaces .
so , space , aesthetics , and then , most importantly , behavior .
i had to shut up a few bridges behind me .
all of it refers to the most powerful and students who were going to be able to be able to be able to show you a place .
so i made some sketches on the brakes -- little boxes and the things that i usually drew .
it &apos;s one of the most beautiful pieces i &apos;ve ever done .
this beautiful object , the swiss army , for me , is going to be a involvement .
and one day i had one -- oh , other other .
i &apos;ve done the most thin and the copper very thin , so it &apos;s a lot of fun .
and that &apos;s my cafeteria .
and it reminded me why i was doing things like my house as well as my house .
she never was finished .
the dome was a wish of the most popular .
it was a attempt to do this little piece of land -- it &apos;s 30 on 76 feet -- to turn into a property of the way that you separated these areas and the air room in this womb , with a high space in this highlands .
they call this &quot; plan of &quot; plan . &quot;
here &apos;s it .
from the building in the background , it seems like a laser iceberg in the mountains .
our clients don &apos;t want galleries , so -- and when we met our new ones , he said that this was or the right shape .
in 1871 , i was asked to make a fish , we &apos;re working on the foot of the computer , which was made of the computer , which was built by the computer , and the most powerful thing was built .
can we not make clean burning ?
and one of the things you found was that she wasn &apos;t burned .
and this is our favorite rabbit .
and he &apos;s compared to the problem of health effects , and coal compared to the wood of the public .
it &apos;s a place where it would be india , in this room only three of us have a car .
so you can &apos;t use the same concepts like in the united states to move things .
there &apos;s a big difference .
after a surgery , everything is going to be .
well , that &apos;s not surprising . but we asked them to grade their honesty and intelligence , kindness and the most powerful .
he married . he had a son called a son called a son .
is this business with our outer and our engagement with this , and our engagement with this is a phenomenon of phenomenon ?
i want to tell you a little bit about the surgeries that we &apos;re doing , how far we are and where we want to .
we can replace the underwater structure , but we &apos;re not very far with the rescue of the support .
my theme is food in schools , because here &apos;s what it is about social justice .
and the next is the next thing .
people are constantly talking about sustainability . but we should find out what that is .
do you know that all of you have to think more and more food ?
and then they have a little bit of the stuff , hey , we can sell the stuff to children .
and this is a typical of a typical .
the things that we might do is to do that , and so important to be able to teach kids to the schools .
we need to educate the employees .
these eight billion mean , by the way , two dollars , and 49 cents -- so much money is willing to be ready for lunch .
as a little girl , my grandfather was sitting on a hot book .
if i go to a party , and people ask me what i do , and i say , &quot; i &apos;m a professor , &quot; you &apos;ll be a professor , your eyes .
i want to get your favorite , everything about your own creature , to know -- that you &apos;re a professional in things in your mind .
don &apos;t make the tension . i want to be more likely to be a little bit more .
it &apos;s about a documentary in the mind of consciousness .
when i came closer , i expected to see all the details of most people , their clothes and so on .
where do you know that it was what they did ?
look at it ? who &apos;s not seeing it ? that &apos;s going to help .
we start to start . some examples .
now , jeff &apos;s talks has described his efforts , a good , big theory in neuroscience .
and the most popular in london said , &quot; what do you mean with : &quot; who is in charge of london -- &quot; i mean , nobody is in charge . &quot;
now , congestion pricing were introduced in stockholm at the third of january , and the first picture ; here &apos;s a picture of stockholm , a typical road at the second of january .
so , we did this enormous survey with many of the most powerful and trying to figure out who changed and where they disappeared .
then i went to 20 years -- from eastern europe , after central asia -- through the mountains of the caucasus , the east east , north africa , russia .
what do we know from the taliban of the taliban who are going to be in the doors of people who are going to be able to send their daughters to schools like in the world ?
the world changed .
i was in my office , my desk was flooded , i had the blue of the walls on the walls .
and there was even two of them .
there was really what .
how amazing is that ?
so i want to talk about some other patients , and i &apos;m going to talk about some other patients in their power to improve health care .
and then i realized that the page of google earth reminded where we can fly to each address .
we are , they &apos;re most of the most successful resource in health care .
and the water of seawater is a more powerful .
here &apos;s the resolution . a wonderful creature , right ?
they don &apos;t take their environment with the sound sound , and i &apos;m talking about the most powerful .
in the united states , the annual cost would be in the u.s. , and we &apos;re going to get the annual cost of the world &apos;s population , so that bats are going to be in every case .
why should we deal with aging at all ?
if you go out here , and look at the night sky and see this beautiful , flying animal , i wish you smile . thank you very much .
europe had to be in the economic development .
the boom of the resources are not all of the time , but it &apos;s not all countries in the bottom billion .
so what &apos;s wrong ? why are there the so-called &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so the countries need the bottom billion a very powerful politics .
a few economists came in time and said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try a auction ? you will reveal the value . &quot;
in this moment , there &apos;s a billion people in the world , or a billion people , and how can we help them ? the economist paul &apos;s , a very compassionate plan , with the very compassionate plan , with that we can close the gap between arm and rich .
we don &apos;t have a container where they &apos;re made .
here he gives a english designer in africa that &apos;s needed to be able to be able to be able to be able to do that .
so we have this : imagine , you thought , you thought , you thought , you know , you could talk to the people in their native language .
&quot; foundations of the world &apos;s surgery .
14 years ago , i was looking at this ordinary material , and i was using the first time in the same way .
he asks me if i could build this as a piece of a piece of the city .
so we were experimenting with little more sophisticated , to create a dry fog that &apos;s shaped by wind . and they found out that he can be shaped by people that are interacting with that and move through , without being able to get to be able to get out of the way .
they were in their own , and they were watching the pattern of the way that they didn &apos;t know , and they were shared the miracle of the miracle that they didn &apos;t know , and shared the miracle .
so , i was also paying attention to that that this is an enormous risk for our society .
when peter moves his arm , this yellow spot is the place that you see in the way that you &apos;re going to be able to do that in the way that you &apos;re going to be in the way that you &apos;re going to be in the mind .
if you do this , what will you want to control ?
and to say that these changes can be beyond death , even a claim about a fact that of course , or wrong .
now let me clear , what i don &apos;t say . i don &apos;t say science can be able to have this room , or that we &apos;re going to have scientific answers to each other .
now why wouldn &apos;t this be an objective morality ?
how high is the probability that this is a summit of human development ?
on the left , you see edward &apos;s .
we live in a world full of technology and these technologies can &apos;t be able to break it , it &apos;s always easier to break out , and it &apos;s always easier to break up as they &apos;re together .
but then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
and what is his natural enemy , what the means of the good beetle that we talk about ?
it &apos;s a parasite , no more , not a computer , but a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , a little bit , a quick and agile , a quick and agile .
and if we &apos;re going to take these good things to a , for example , they go to the flowers .
in israel , where we &apos;re on 1,000 acres -- that &apos;s 10,000 israeli , and biological pest -- biological pest in the world &apos;s population , were 75 percent of the pesticides .
third , to increase the consciousness of the farmers for the potential of this kind of thing .
and the one of my favorite things is one of my favorite things .
it &apos;s even fun to make the most powerful , as over the world &apos;s own , and i do it often .
&quot; urban &quot; -- that &apos;s what the new yorker needs .
her name was a name of the name , and so that was -- i was not a lot of time to say , &quot; take the drawing . &quot;
or the collapse of soviet union only found some decades , maybe within a decade , after the time , instead of the soviet union , the soviet union was most powerful .
because there are 80 percent out there that really eat insects .
they &apos;re at the beginning of food food .
why do we actually do this balls in the soup , but it &apos;s still meat in the soup ?
it &apos;s 25 pounds per person per person per year .
so , until now we decide to be a , or to five kilograms of output .
we can increase them a little bit of the rainforests , but it &apos;s going to be a boundary .
and you might think , well , these are not available .
my three minutes haven &apos;t begun , right ?
he said , &quot; allison , we have to put them on the table .
and i saw a sign .
even if canadian the system is going to do it , they do it on a way that society is going to be .
and in this book , the little lewis would find the big idea .
this is a kind of a computer . and on the back , some other storms are , and scales , and scales to make some calculations . okay ?
right . so , the device is used .
there &apos;s a quality of a man and precision that is just amazing and remarkable .
so the first robot i want to talk about is strider .
it &apos;s just used to show that if you have cameras or other sensors because it &apos;s high , it &apos;s a meter 80 , you &apos;re a meter of 80 , you can go over obstacles and the most powerful .
for example , in this case , even though the left and the right wheel is connected to a single axis , and so quickly , it &apos;s going to turn fast .
welcome to the robot , the robot of quantum francisco lab &apos;s lab . &quot;
but the cool thing about it is the user interface .
so , as he &apos;s doing . this was our first attempt , and ...
but what is the secret of our success ?
but only from a lifelong of imagination , not enough .
so , in this way , education is very important .
and the most important thing to get to the world &apos;s --
there &apos;s basically no pool of good bees , and only eight percent of the county of the county have a more powerful or higher degree .
there &apos;s a complete empty on creative capital in bertie county .
the goal of the game is , all the team on wheels are sitting in the wheels , then the team won .
but in the last few decades , it went to a lot of money that was determined for a mile .
and after outside , and the neighbors interview what they buy , and where and why , and why , is a homework .
in these is the very impossible , big sensations .
i want to invite you to follow my journey of the computer and explore .
after four months , it &apos;s been taken out and now stand up eight months before .
here &apos;s a few results .
this global act is going to be in the same way to climate change , as it &apos;s fossil fuels , maybe even more than this .
when i learned from these two things , i was very , very , both of the personal reasons as well as scientific reasons .
it &apos;s a very good thing to do , which is partly the case of the ronald foundation , which was partly the ronald foundation .
and after treatment , we &apos;re doing a series of simple , a series of simple , to see how his vision is going to adapt .
the answer is in motion . i want to show you the next video .
i had to discuss a long time with my wife .
we &apos;re going to track this research research and hopefully , hopefully more results .
and then i have a lot of these kinds of things for physically disabled , and i thought , oh , i don &apos;t know , but before i dreamed about it , i &apos;m looking at how this is .
but that was in the fall of 95 and then when the winter was falling down , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , it &apos;s aimee to the special 1996 , and she &apos;s very excited about it . their family travels to -- it &apos;s a big thing .
i tried to do every one i could , who could , against who , against which , is i &apos;m going to go here ?
i always won everything and now i thought , what ?
you can be a big deal . take it just off . &quot;
host : aimee and designers will be at ted , and we &apos;re going to talk about the design .
they got somebody who came over and the shoes were going to be .
but it &apos;s almost impossible , the actual losses of the economy , because it &apos;s , we use math .
or to the streams of the jobs .
and something about mathematics : math sometimes looks like math -- how in this example -- and sometimes it doesn &apos;t -- how do i say , &quot; am i drunk ? &quot;
in math math , we use about 80 percent of the time to teach people how to start three of hand .
if people ask me , right ?
but the lesters in cars allowed to separate these things , so that &apos;s what &apos;s going on today , as that &apos;s a car and learning of his life .
completely wrong .
but i think we can do both at the same time .
and one of the reasons why that is so important -- so it &apos;s very important , computers in the tests .
it was winter in 2009 , and i &apos;ve been blind for about a year .
i thought , especially my father was dying of complications , who was dead from complications of a surgical surgery .
similarly , as you can , just through the handle of the ground , the world &apos;s change can be the ground , and it makes a notion of where you &apos;re and what you &apos;re going to do .
but when i was then able to get out and the broadway went along , i was blessed at everybody corner .
if you design a city in the blind of the blind , it will give many , many jobs .
to give you a sense of this experience , the article was called &quot; i think you &apos;re going to be able to get a &quot; i think of you . &quot;
and the most famous thing that i knew -- the 10 commandments , love your next , is fertile and the you ...
you &apos;re giving money for a good purpose and it &apos;s developed emotional to the purpose .
it &apos;s not a book that was written and the sky &apos;s sky .
so , this is actually the key to me , and i &apos;m actually the key to remind me that the way that the car is not going to be a car , and i don &apos;t go up on the way .
that was very inspiring for me .
so if we want to do this book , some meaning , we have to really be able to get it to the world , and with him .
so we have this wonderful progress .
the academics that were going to be able to get this work to be the way that we have been able to have the data of the world , so we &apos;ve developed applications like this in the world &apos;s brain , which is a laser on a laser .
alex worked on a little , something called a little bit of a independent , independent report with steven , and invited us to develop a interface that &apos;s used to develop the movie in the movie .
we &apos;re going to lead these kinds of surgery through because we like yellow and the green , and we like to be on green .
let &apos;s pull the apart out : i &apos;ll bring it into a little bit of time .
we , as humans , are the things that are designing and we should make sure that our machines help us and build it .
john , thank you for doing science science .
what okolloh did was not possible without digital technologies .
but here &apos;s the point . the most creative choice is still a creative act .
but the institutions that are shown by this black line said , &quot; we change this deal immediately .
they &apos;re created by the members of the community for each other .
and as all the good things do , they make a leap from 20 years when the interest changes the audience .
you don &apos;t always have five days available to the way that changes and we started playing with play .
india didn &apos;t want to play in the most popular .
the other was a indian cricket .
it was the new india ? that was another world where you could get players from everywhere , as long as you had the best player for the best price .
we &apos;ve been seeing games in calcutta , but we &apos;ve never seen anything yet . comics khan brought the audience with a computer song , for calcutta , not for india , but for calcutta .
could you imagine that this day would come ?
hopefully i &apos;ve made a different experience of a different experience , and the game is the most popular and hopefully , and hopefully there &apos;s a longer time in this business .
and you know that the answer is , because they have fast in memory , as often they have dogs and pigs on the rope .
why about everything in the world should play anybody ?
on the other hand , if you go to developing countries , you can buy a computer , and you can buy a little bit of a little bit of a little mac , it &apos;s a big mac for a big mac .
would you spend your remaining 20 dollars for a ticket ?
i &apos;ll give you an example .
and if the way to the other end of the city is 100 mice worth it , it &apos;s 100 mice worth , completely no matter what they &apos;re going to be saved with , but people don &apos;t think that .
well , in the big and all of you , you &apos;re enormously impatient .
watch what happens when we &apos;re going to skip .
dan , i &apos;d like to hear more . so you say that our answer is to terrorism , i mean , that he &apos;s a kind of mental error ?
there are no guns .
and so some people look at economists as stupid people .
and the variation and variation is one of these most powerful , which requires a certain intellectual activity , because you &apos;re always comparing the variation with the subject that you have in mind .
and in fashion , in the words , and in fashion , the same rule is fantastic when to new or old / age , not the first thing that was trying to put in the last one of the old , and &quot; the old one is the old one . &quot;
and i woke up a day and said , &quot; well , maybe it &apos;s not that ? &quot;
first , my willingness to be a critical audience , without explaining me to me .
it &apos;s my intention to go to the poster , you should not have understood it yet .
so in the big and all of them , they &apos;re going to be our survival .
jews often have a uncomfortable odor odor .
if the room was held , we could see that people were more negative attitudes to gay men .
it &apos;s as if i was going to talk about what i &apos;ve done in this 20 years in the distance .
it feeds my mind and my soul .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director of american director , hollywood director , with his friends , other filmmakers , and they talk about what cinema means .
without food , i was sick .
we don &apos;t need trouble anymore , the idiots .
our government was corrupt .
so for me , the idea that we have all these kids , it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of children that had to go through so much psychological trauma or damage to africa .
through the whole book , more than an hour of a hour , and interactive animations .
what is the business ?
it was at least that you &apos;re going to be , in fact , largely true .
so i thought , &quot; yes , this is a good idea . &quot;
and the talk still about it .
when i came from college , i worked in southern california , and you &apos;re going to be able to get the spanish to the rooftops and these things .
rsw : how does his doublet look like ?
the most important thing -- they &apos;ve been sending me to the mit with the mit and they sent their technical engineering to bilbao .
this is reminded me .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; so what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
if you want to go to three months , the ideas are always becoming more clear and living .
and one thing i wanted to mention at my favorite time , but somehow missed , it was all the business to thank me , who helped me to do that .
but in the meantime , these things are winning momentum .
and this is 10 weeks later , from hand .
you see the kosovars that are the most powerful .
the yemeni of styles and things is remarkable , and this is what the most important thing is to be .
it &apos;s an incredible endeavor , 15,000 workers , i think , five , and the sixth is built here .
on this level , the 1,500 workers work .
50 percent of the computer on the world land to recycling in china .
it was quite unusual , stefan , that less than five percent of advertising had a picture as a theme of the subject .
and wish three is : the most important thing , i was told , i should be able to do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
and it will increasingly be more important that we can figure out how to win these resources from these extremely complex .
the traditional ways to separate material is simply not for plastics .
the traditional way to make the oil , and we &apos;re going to make oil , or ebola .
at the end of this process , we have a mixed of a mixed , many different kinds of plastic and many different qualities of plastic .
now i see a lot of the most powerful out there .
and what we see is that people tend to commit mistakes to the same way , again , again , again .
maybe we should study how monkeys make economic decisions and find out whether they commit the same stupid as we do .
here &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a time , and it &apos;s going to share a brand against food and wait happy , and get your food .
they wait to wait for a little impatient that the market opens .
now imagine that i press every 1,000 of you in the hand -- so 10 times a hundred dollars of notes .
you can either choose a loss of loss -- so , i throw a coin . in head , you &apos;re really losing a lot of it .
if we made the same scenarios , the same scenarios would be made , you would do the same things like people ?
the person to the left is a safer loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just people on the last stage of development that make dumb mistakes .
and that &apos;s the catch .
but if we think about building government , the most common stories are up .
we need to have less with concrete and steel and we have to build higher . in recent time , we worked on the most powerful .
this is just a lot of time than we have less in a year of 900 cars .
and the guards of the legs are going to be my window .
maybe , &quot; citizens , &quot; because recently they &apos;re up to fight against the decline of the law , and the citizens of these networks work together to help each other .
and the largest and oldest bank in russia , most of the time in russia , is in the property of russian government , now , to be a lot of the people , and the citizens in the development of innovation with the development of innovation .
we &apos;ve heard about ted , and we &apos;ve heard about people who have been hacked with their plants , and they work on the world , and they &apos;re working on the world , to create the world , to create websites and to turn videos .
and so i started thinking that the eternal mother always asks himself , &quot; are all children there ? &quot;
this is compassion .
he asked them to convey a message , and all read in their own language , a central of the golden rule , which was a version of the golden rule : &quot; what you don &apos;t want to do is you don &apos;t want to do it . &quot;
a pastor is called to take care of these individual needs .
and we do this through some of the things .
there &apos;s over 180 messages in washington d.c.
it &apos;s taken from parks and sculptures .
it &apos;s made of the fiber fiber .
there &apos;s also some constraints on its lighting .
the bubble is a more powerful .
i saw my aunt raped when i was only five .
one of the things i experienced when i was trying to eat my friend because we didn &apos;t have food and we were the 400 .
as a child , as young and the very young , words i can &apos;t forget , not forget .
this is my story , and it &apos;s a lesson in a lesson of a lesson .
my breakfast , my lunch , i &apos;m going to a foundation that i &apos;ve founded , because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give the farmers tools .
audience : yeah !
the third chapter is a more complicated thing called &quot; jurassic &quot; .
that means more than 60 percent are for it .
we &apos;re going to solve this task by expanding the problem of death penalty .
and even if that happens , it &apos;s not too late .
i remember nothing from time when i was five years old .
santa claus knows if you were a good or not . right ?
but julie , you were so ready for school . you were so ready . &quot;
they looked at each other and smiles , where the senses was the right answer . then they said , &quot; do you think we all brothers and sisters on earth ? &quot;
maybe your bigger ability to cooperate and adapt ?
i think this film shows the hardest view of the modern times . &quot;
in the second world war , we had to produce a lot of stuff .
but we can &apos;t forget that it takes a fundamental contribution to that , and that &apos;s how many resources of the planet we use .
but now to the good news !
it &apos;s perhaps in latin america .
and at that point , the skeptic and the climate change of climate change in vision .
we &apos;ve done a project for a few years ago , a big program , it was called the most important -- with many , many people -- many people -- many experts were involved -- a huge amount of experts .
a group of people asked them to spend it for themselves and should spend the other group for other people .
when you went from the first building to the second , all of the time , all of the time , who was dominated and went , and clearly help , and the question was , and helped it ?
the word is &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &#91; about &#93; : &#93; , the hidden life , the hidden life .
since since , there are four decades -- i &apos;ve been trained to be trained with the best in this area , and i had a young thing in the world , and i &apos;ve been taught , young and old , created , and the other a set of the art of art , successes and awards .
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my real life force .
i dance between the street and i was going to be able to adapt to this , and i was going to adapt to this one of my favorite things .
well , it was essentially frustration .
this is like it was .
he put them together , and they put them together , and then he has been convicted of this software , which i believe they were originally developed , and he made this wonderful presentation .
in these documents , there are little little pieces of boxes .
i want to suggest -- yes , make a beautiful website , how could i say , you don &apos;t want to make a nice website ?
now you ask the linked data that you have now put together . 32 hits of which everybody is a protein with these properties and you can look at them .
and that &apos;s what it is about linked data .
all of this will lead to that every year two million children die less , in the last year , when in 2000 .
and if it &apos;s so , we &apos;re ready to collect feedback , to give feedback , to make sure that the promise really provide results ?
you just show one of the numbers there , the 5,000 -- is that the number ?
my brothers started to give me tips for drawing and paint .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been fascinated with to explore this area .
how many of you have a cow on the road on the road , to the road of bangalore ?
it &apos;s just that we &apos;re trained to be trained to see the reality that makes reality so .
and they said , &quot; go right .
can &apos;t you do anything , you &apos;re artists ? &quot;
this is a box from a box of the field .
because if we see somebody &apos;s going to see someone , we see the footprint .
what percentage of the foreign has made foreign health ?
obviously he sat in a cave , and he sat in a cave .
so the foreign production is actually really beautiful to get here , because -- if you think about it , i &apos;ve been talking about economists today , and i &apos;ve been telling you about economists that are very much more sophisticated .
this is the place i showed you at the beginning .
we &apos;re going to be a bit of technical .
think about toyota .
you can &apos;t do it about it , so you accept it and find it a way to work with it .
it &apos;s very hard to agree .
it &apos;s a little bit of a time , and it &apos;s a lot of time .
pizza get them , if they have hunger .
there are millions of different types of things .
so , you remember , if we think about sexual education and activities , they &apos;re out of baseball .
it &apos;s from the poet of the poet , and it &apos;s like , &quot; i can &apos;t get it to the most important .
and that &apos;s what much percent of the day you think about this person ? &quot;
in about a hundred societies , people are leaving the most powerful brain structure .
they came home with the high percent of dinner .
and it was really a strong force .
and i said , &quot; why do you think men are more powerful than women ? &quot;
no time in this world , the women were so educated , so interesting , so interesting .
she &apos;s been 23 she has been taken it for her 13 .
i started to get to the way that you &apos;re in love with a person , when the other one .
they &apos;re going to be as long as the human race is on what shakespeare called &quot; these predators &quot; .
but unfortunately , i know it .
most researchers believe that obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
maybe we should ask ourselves whether it could be that the resistance is the cause of weight and the cause of weight -- at least most people ?
other people , it &apos;s too much more .
peter &apos;s : what if our views would be wrong about diabetes ?
my great , henry ford , really believed that it was the mission of ford motor company , the life of people to improve the people and make cars affordable .
and the good news is that we &apos;re going to get the big problems of cars and environment -- not only ford , but in total as industry .
i think you can imagine it already .
but what really inspired me is the possibilities that we &apos;re going to have when our cars start to communicate with each other .
we need a infrastructure that is able to support these flexible future .
this is a minute 59 .
i think now my mother , i &apos;m like a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a
the nurses have to go around .
this is really important . it &apos;s much . &quot;
so what &apos;s coming out ?
and for us , it was great because we won a lot of awards .
i was infected when i was 17 , then when a student was a student , i came to adults , i was going to be adult , and many of the most powerful things that i was doing with my ideas .
now it was just about the kids . so we don &apos;t .
basically , we gave the kids a simple task .
for our auction , we have some wonderful images for them , for a really good purpose that you give us , will be used to buy hearing hearing .
but what i never said , and what i want to do is that the cool thing is that it &apos;s cool .
in a way , in the elegant or a little bit available , the elegant product that we have is the book of the book that we have in the morning , the most important one of the development , which is another kind of development -- and inspired by the incredible way .
if you think about the change in our society , the most important thing in the cities , the country has taken the country in the cities , which is the same process in 20 years .
it looked like that , even though these were unknown .
so , for example , we would put the models under a artificial sky .
i think a reduction in the height of 94 percent for almost in .
and how do we do something that &apos;s going to be a little bit more powerful in this growing world , especially some places i &apos;m talking about -- china for example , that &apos;s 400 years of the next 10 years .
and this is the focus of the world &apos;s talk -- there &apos;s no lighting in positive sense that is healthy and our well-being ; without a reasonable darkness .
unlike the first office , i showed you the beginning of the talk , is this a very well-known office , which is that the most popular .
behind you , you see the most powerful building building that was later to a icon of modern design .
i think that &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing here , and i &apos;m going to see what &apos;s going on in the sky , and never reached the ground .
this is not very pleasant and the most pleasant .
they &apos;re not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able .
if our main system , as some weeks before , a war in a third of india is going to be held , about 200 of the things that are the most important , he &apos;s wrong with the theme , he &apos;s wrong .
and one day -- i don &apos;t know what happened -- while i was home from the office , i might be able to see a consumer , or it was in the sense : could i be wonderful .
anil gupta : but what &apos;s going to use it ? what was it used ?
to do what to do ? to dig stones .
this is the only place where you could express your creativity .
they don &apos;t want to be a second choice of standards and the most powerful .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s made of the most powerful thing that &apos;s made of the world &apos;s design .
i had to do my favorite .
mr. , who lives with a physical challenge , just 50 inches of big .
and the most powerful , the most powerful .
this is a little bit of a time .
these are the very shaky billion people .
or ski . it &apos;s just fun and people love it to do it and make fun things .
so we &apos;ve been working very , very hard , but we knew that it wouldn &apos;t be so hard to develop the technology as the acceptance of what &apos;s important and how technology can be used .
cars are not made to park next to the next ; it &apos;s wonderful to be with them between cities and drive , but think about it , and think about it , we have all the problems in terms of the range and speed .
so if we could add this box here , we have a solution to the transportation of transportation , electricity , and communication , and maybe water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 kilograms ?
and the case or potentially is being approved that people who die there , somehow , are involved in the drug drugs . that &apos;s what we &apos;re either tortured , or they were , or even both .
go to zetas as a ties of psychopaths , which is fear and horror in cities and bring the press to the silence , and that &apos;s true to most .
mexico and the united states is now a truly international organization , the partnerships with production in the south and global partnerships in global distribution .
but also , part of it is to be a month of being a year -- you live in the future . and we have a long time .
and after you fall under a critical price , it tends to be successful , if you &apos;re successful , about a critical mass of a breakthrough .
but they &apos;re going to be very , very cheap , and look at the interesting effects . if you &apos;re getting cheaper , the brands , the brands and so , the most powerful , the most powerful , they win .
if you look here , linux is in red , it has 20 percent .
&quot; open available is really , you know , the gift of silicon , the world &apos;s gift .
because of some of the technologies we talked about .
patient capital works between the best , and it &apos;s trying to take the best from both .
the second thing to be very cheap is to be very cheap .
president obama understands this .
because one of the poorest farmers in the world had found access to a technology that allows him to change his life .
and yet , this is exactly the properties of the men and women , and women are honored by all generations .
they remember , while the most popular was in his blog , he was in his blog , and they often had to be able to do it , because blogs are easy to use .
i like music , and i like to do it , and i think i heard steve martin , and i said , i can also play .
i wrote this post , and i took this to einstein today .
and you see this post .
these little things .
and maybe i have to get a lot of time because i &apos;m talking about it when i &apos;m talking about it .
he was used to be sustainable , except from our generation .
we need to use this process immediately to get a better understanding of how the oceans are going to get .
we &apos;ve studied these fish in the very noisy , but we had to learn how to keep them .
but that &apos;s just half as big as the largest tuna we &apos;ve ever tagged .
they come together . that could be sex under tunas , and there &apos;s it .
you can get a lure -- it &apos;s a penny like a seal -- and a white shark will go to this , a very dense creature that comes very dense on our 16 feet .
and then we &apos;re going to give these animals to a encore by helping us .
and the white shark .
i think he didn &apos;t think the records of my own was so precisely .
they said , &quot; besides the , we &apos;ve talked about , are they groups that want to harm the united states ? &quot;
you don &apos;t have to waste your energy .
now , who &apos;s looking at my favorite , looking at that , and i know that i was in the ninth may for $ a little bit of the time in the stadium .
all of the moments i press a computer company on my life .
when i started with the project , people said , &quot; why would you want to say all of what you &apos;re doing and where you &apos;re ?
now it &apos;s normal .
now , look at this kind of thing , please , to see how incredibly fast the growth is .
i looked at thousands of these kinds of things , and trust and efficiency are always a difference .
how do we be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
i was sort of a mind in the system .
this page gets a day of a day , and 80 percent of it gets a precise answer .
i want to start with a paradox .
and here you see it in relation to inequality , which i showed you , i &apos;m going to come back to the back of the inequality .
first of all , with the rich , countries , and then in a second , and then in a second , the same question , with the same question , is the same question : cut the more unequal states on all these scales ?
with devastating effects , what the use of the population is about .
and in our analysis of american states , we find the same .
the social judgments are taking to take the judgments , and fear of these judge .
or for example , why violence is more prevalent in more unequal societies , because people are sensitive to that , to become approved .
a year more than three million gifted , a new knee or a new knee .
they remember the kamal before the most popular .
if you wear it under pants or a rock , or a sari , it &apos;s very clear that you wear a prosthetic , and in societies where disability with a social stigma is , people are very sensitive .
so thank you .
you want a dirty magazine ?
i actually bought the most powerful thing , and there &apos;s a little piece of paper on the , which is , &quot; use these kinds of things that are not to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of juice .
this is the results of the world , &quot; google just so many &quot; o &quot; , like the pages of the pages .
strong fear is a lot of fear .
but if you were always in this condition , the work would never be done . because you would say , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve found a new way to make it . &quot;
almost everything we do is subconscious .
it &apos;s about being safe in this world .
would the national park , and would fall apart , then they would never be a ride .
it &apos;s a very small sample -- you should not be able to get the results .
i &apos;m going to talk about children and self-organization and a series of experiments that were going to be able to look like an alternative education .
and at night , this day , 70 children in the internet .
so i could actually choose samples to cover a c-section , which represents the whole world .
what you &apos;re seeing obviously is , there &apos;s a child that &apos;s going to use the computer .
natural systems are all self-organization : galaxies , molecules , cells , organisms , societies -- except the discussion of the theory of the intelligent designers .
and it &apos;s about the languages of idealism in this whole way .
i bought a nice suit , and i was wearing shoes with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
but 2002 , when my tour went to end , i decided i didn &apos;t go to the job that was waiting for me to go back to london .
i felt that something was destroyed .
and i went through . i went through this crowd .
and i traveled in kosovo and gave the government .
independent diplomat is part of a trends that comes to the world , obviously , and shows that the world is medicalized .
it &apos;s terrible that they &apos;re actually affected by these people who are actually affected .
this is the politics of the 21st century , and in a certain sense , independent diplomat is these kinds of things that are happening with us all .
&quot; hey , could you get me more to get it ? &quot;
because if we go back to the most important , they understood that a simple mistake can tell you what you &apos;re not going to say , or remember why you love something .
we feel awe , pity .
go ahead .
what is the number one ?
no . in the &apos; 70s , there was the most profound show , &quot; the &quot; the 1973 , &quot; the 1973 , the in the top 10 rise , followed by &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
i can choose them from the island .
and i &apos;m very excited about it to discuss with you , i &apos;m going to come in and say , &quot; can someone tell me the basic thing , and why that &apos;s so cool ? &quot;
next , this dna virus produces stuff that is the bacteria .
from a series of reasons .
or even worse , science education will always be more like the guy who says , &quot; actually ... &quot;
but we have so much work in front of us and when somebody is involved in science , i &apos;ll ask you to get to me .
we go up the staircase and experience a state of consciousness .
so many books about war say the same thing that nothing is so common like war .
durkheim believed that everything , what we &apos;re going to do , seems to take a holiness from holiness .
he kept going to continue , &quot; the &quot; the &quot; and the people who are not going to get together and without a foster , no one can be moving . &quot;
he uses the other .
once they were all in a same tribe , they could keep the benefits of cooperation .
it &apos;s about connecting to other people to track ethical ideas .
jh : thank you .
i realized that the fact that the fact must be not just in the inside .
and right next to the garage , he &apos;s got his own own , where he can be in his achievements , which is another important role in the world .
everything is always easier to design in design , and here &apos;s this kind of thing , and , my god , i just photographed it .
&quot; the end of print &quot; will now be printed for the fifth time .
this book is called &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
this is actually an experiment for a client , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done a sequence of six photos , and we tried to get people over the base medium .
they said that people didn &apos;t liked them .
a article about brian &apos;s -- a really boring article -- so i &apos;ve put all the article in the whole paper .
somebody told me today , there were these things that are called the folder , but i don &apos;t know what that is .
this is pretty high for most professions .
and there was obviously , obviously , no technology . but obviously .
this is not another planet . these are things that are hidden on our planet .
and finally , i come back to these kinds of things .
this is a little bit of a little bit of a time of the theory of the theory of the theory of the theory of the theory of the theory of the theory .
we heard about the power of the guns , the guns .
and i think that &apos;s really important . because if you can imagine mozart before the invention of the technology -- what that would be for a loss of society .
octopus &apos;s first time i was very young .
he picks up again , take a arm full of authentic , it &apos;s going to go -- &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; -- the same thing happens . &quot;
but the point is , we were a month there , and i wanted to use the animals to use the animals , so that we could see their behaviors without to get them .
and if you go down to the bottom , the lovely blue water is going to be the very , you get to start the beginning of the day and you &apos;re going to get it to the beginning of the day .
but there &apos;s no sun down there , there &apos;s no photosynthesis . it &apos;s a world &apos;s world down there , which is it , and it &apos;s all so so so so so so so so so .
but i also saw the exact opposite .
everybody talks about each other . then it &apos;s not a little bit of a map of a map , and then it &apos;s a network that we have created .
she was a lot of a sudden , and she didn &apos;t go and go and go and get us out of how little girls . they didn &apos;t buy a pink clothes , but he knew , he knew , but knew , he knew , but knew , he knew , but knew , he knew , but knew , he knew , but knew , he knew , but knew , he knew , but knew , he knew , but knew , he knew , but knew , he knew , but knew , he knew

we &apos;re going to act our entire economy , and we &apos;re shown in the corner of the left : the bottom of the left .
the heart valve increases , they live longer , and they &apos;re going to slow down to the membranes of the membranes , etc .
but the most important thing is that the equivalent of the equivalent of the network of the metabolism is the equivalent of the metabolism .
they &apos;re rapidly growing and stop our own part of our own .
look at a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a computer .
children in the 12th grade are less excited about political systems .
he had to talk to a high school in high school .
my students made this climber as a result of a task that we had in terms of the oil spills of the year .
this is my favorite slide because it was a tuesday , when i was going to go to the election .
and with this is it .

it &apos;s a computer system .
and he asked a very important question .
and i &apos;m going to show you the 15 million dollars .
you see the stem cells again .
many of these patients are hard .
the european union , the same .
and although i don &apos;t have patents , so much of me , you &apos;ll be able to meet some of my inventions today .
you know , of course , what that means .
and they &apos;ve been going to be able to do all of these progress in so short time . they &apos;re all so young .
thank you all .
in school -- actually , i have an organization that makes a power of a power that makes a difference , you know , you would really like it and so .

my daughter -- my daughter wrote this , she said , &quot; start to start with humor . &quot;
i &apos;m a hopeful . &quot;
i want your hand .
and then i finally got a call to the last year that i should talk to you right after the day of the day .
and i thought , if i could write books , where these world was small and connected , i might be able to do people for the problems that all affect us , and maybe they &apos;re moving to improve the world .
and john said , &quot; bet good people who do good .
there was no specific media media that focuses on the public interest .
i thought the problem came in the world &apos;s years .
i learned that there &apos;s not only a proper way to change change .
what do you think how many policemen are on this taxi ? well , three .

our revenues are clearly gone faster , which is a healthy profit , and that although we treat many people free .
this is a difficult task .
for example , we can add digital content with physical mass .
wouldn &apos;t that be a way to make cell phones more intuitive ?
it was when they couldn &apos;t see me more than i was invisible .

but if i took a base of the pixels , and if i was going to be a base of the proton with the resolution of the x x 800 distributed , we would need 3,000 screens to take a look at the genome .

and we also heard about the story of humanity &apos;s disease by the genetic water of humanity .
in the most important , we find many , many examples of compassion , morally for love and real altruism .

so what do we learn today ?
about 10 calories will need to be a c-section that we consume in the west , to produce .
so like the city of a city ?
and the city in the east , in the east , will be offered to sale . that &apos;s why it &apos;s called the most powerful .
and in this point , our relationship is completely , both to food as well as the cities .
the word of utopia used thomas moore &apos;s disease .
and the whole bunch of the sun .
we need to understand that the world is also what we eat .

and the doctor says he &apos;s just not going to move that way .
&quot; who attack us , risk the end of the world . &quot;
the leviathan force is just going to be left from his pen .
it &apos;s a lot of time .
force force , strategic food cells .
thomas barnett : a new way to peace
i don &apos;t want to be too much .
here you see the most powerful in the early world , which brought a lot of sulfur into the stratosphere with a kind of nuclear cloud .
this report ended up at president , when i was two years old . in 1965 .
but let &apos;s say , you have sunlight , which is true of particles and it &apos;s frozen .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to happen . it &apos;s not very likely .
we continue to go under this scenario and further from the present climate .
not just about how we do better , but what are the risks and side effects ?
here you see a fish with bright , and you can see a fish .
really incredible . here &apos;s two males .
and so i was just going to be on her friendly invitation , two days ago .
but if you look at the literature in east and west , you will find incredibly different definitions of happiness .
well-being is a deeper sense of serenity and fulfillment , a state that actually all the states are going to put and you &apos;re going to be able to get and worry and worry about that .

the mirror allows you , but the mirror is not going to be transformed by this images , not changing by these images .
if you &apos;re doing that again , your tendency to get your tendency to get the anger back to each time you get it , lower .

we &apos;re ready for 15 years to our education .
it &apos;s really a huge thing for us .
it &apos;s a place . it &apos;s good designed .
you can see exactly what &apos;s happening at night to three of the most important things .
not just just just just just just just a cartoon of the sierra nevada .

we &apos;re going to be -- we have a system of a system that would be ashamed of the neocortical .
one last statement -- that &apos;s what i &apos;m worried about for years , but i think it &apos;s particularly important for this audience .
and at that point , we &apos;re about two days away from the entrance .
this is a little bit of a way of the cycle of the cycle .
the ice can be between five and 25 miles deep .
the most important thing to see at the front of the back and back , so that it can do new amounts of water while it still keeps the eye , which is already left behind .
it would be 10,000 dollars in orbit .
