you know , one of the great things in travel and one of the pleasures in the world &apos;s research is to live with people who can remember the old days , and they &apos;re going to touch the past , they &apos;re touching the rain , they &apos;re
just knowing that the way that the way of the milky way or the importance of myths are still more important , or that the himalayas is still the breath of the world &apos;s breath , which is the fact that the world is still going to be the
and of course , we all share the same kind of thing .
we &apos;re going to be born all . we bring kids to the world .
we go through the world .
we have to have the objectivity separation through death and so it should not surprise us that we all sing , dance and art .
but interesting is the unique tone of the brain &apos;s rhythm , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the most sophisticated in the forests of the forests , or the most powerful in haiti , or the warrior in the world &apos;s brain , or the warrior in the middle of the sahara , or a half of the
all these people teach us that there &apos;s other people &apos;s other things that are more likely to think of the earth &apos;s own way to the earth .
and that &apos;s a notion that if you think about it , you can get a hope to meet .
together , the number of cultures are going to form a net from the world , and cultural life , which is the earth , and the earth &apos;s same thing is as important as biological energy , which is the biological world , which you know as biosphere
you can imagine this cultural computer system as a more powerful thing , and it can be the most important thing that &apos;s going on as the most important of all thoughts and dreams , myths , inspiration , inspiration and intuitions that were created by the human imagination
the most important is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and what we &apos;re capable of as amazing as a amazing species .
and as the biosphere was very wiped out , this was a lot of the time , and it was just more than greater speed .
no biologist would say to the example that 50 percent or more of all species are short before the extinction , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the most important thing to do on the area of the biological diversity -- is not
and the key objection for this is extinct .
when everybody was born in this room , in the earth , 6,000 languages were talked to 6,000 languages .
now , a language is not just the whole of the vocabulary or a series of the internet .
a language is expression of human mind .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a certain culture is going to find access to the material world .
every language is like a computer forest of the mind , a turning point , a thought , a ecosystem , an spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages today , while we sit here in monterey , half the half of the children are not going to be in the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught to be taught to the infants , which is , if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely than being the silence of the day , one of the last of your people who talk to your language , not to have any possibility to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or to expect the hope children ?
and yet , this terrible fate actually come to the earth somewhere on earth , about all two weeks , because all two weeks , a elderly , and takes the last final one of the old language to the grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; is it not better ? &quot; if the world wasn &apos;t a better place , if we all talk to a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be a language . let &apos;s be
let &apos;s be a pinhead . &quot;
and then suddenly they would recognize how it would be if they couldn &apos;t speak their own language .
so i want to take you in a journey today through the most powerful , a short journey through the most powerful , to try to make you understand what &apos;s actually lost .
now there are some of us who forget that i say , &quot; different possibilities of his , &quot; really different possibilities of his own .
take the one of the child &apos;s name in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the amazon , believe that they &apos;re going to be the most powerful of the east of sacred snakes in the belly of sacred snakes .
this is a people who are different between the colors blue and green , because the forest the forest , the the forest , is dependent on the forest , the people are going to depend on it .
they have a curious language , and a more powerful thing called the linguistic , and you have to marry someone who speaks to another language .
all of this is the most compelling past in the secular past . the strange house in the world , where the most prolific six or seven languages are spoken , but , though you &apos;re never talking to someone who learns a language .
they just hear and start talking to them .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the most amazing people in the northeast of ecuador , a amazing people who was first held in the year of the year .
in 1957 , five characteristic of contact , and they were going to take a mistake .
they threw up the photos of the air , which we would grade as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people were never seen from the rainforest in their lives .
they raised these photographs from the forest forest , trying to see the face or the character , didn &apos;t find it and the character , and they were killing the business business of the devil , and killed the five .
but the most popular , not only the surrounding , was not just the spear .
they &apos;re going to be a little bit of each other .
54 percent of deaths happened through the deaths .
we went back to the most popular eight generations and found two cases of a natural death and when we were doing the people with a very strong thing about it , they gave that one of the people had become so old that he died because of his
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of forests that was amazing .
their hunters could smell the urine of a animal from 40 steps , and determine what species of these agreed .
in the early world , i got a really amazing task when i asked my professor at harvard , if i was interested in go to haiti and to be the secret societies that were the foundation of the strength of the strength and the poison that was used
and to give this big sense of a sense , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of the most remarkable , and voodoo is not a weekly trick of the black magic .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex kind of puzzle worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked them , the big world world was going to be prepared , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , or whatever .
a continent will always leave , because the guess was that there &apos;s no religious faith in sub-saharan africa , and of course , there was a little bit of the very profound religious thought that the tragic diaspora of the world &apos;s most profound , the tragic diaspora
but what &apos;s interesting is that this living relationship is between living and the dead .
the living family gives the spirits .
the spirits can be able to get out of the big water , answers to the rhythm of dance to the soul of the living , to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
and the most important thing is , the most important thing is , &quot; you &apos;re going to go to church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and will be god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the mind , you &apos;re going to be taken from the mind . how can you get damage ?
look at this amazing demonstrations : the red frequency of the red coal , the red coal without burning , an amazing graph of the mind that the body is so to influence that this is the way that it &apos;s going to be a state of extreme arousal
now , from all people i met , the kitchens of the sierra nevada de santa / santa santa was in the most extraordinary , most extraordinary .
offspring of the old civilization civilization , which is the heart of colombia , and in the following of the day , this people moved into a very powerful , massive , which is the world &apos;s favorite , which is the world &apos;s largest , which is the
in a computer continent , these people were the only ones who were never faced by the most prolific .
until today , you &apos;re going to be able to be a ritual priesthood , and the education is very extraordinary .
the young people are separated in the age of three and four years of their families , in the world of the glacier , in the ground of the glacier for 18 years , and two periods of the glacier for 18 years , and they &apos;re going to
and during this whole time , they &apos;re culturally introduced to the values of their society , values that sustain the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
at the end of this amazing , you &apos;ll be a day , and you &apos;ll suddenly take out of your life , in the age of 18 years , you see a tutor , and in this particular moment of consciousness , the first light is going to
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think of native and landscape , we either have a more sophisticated and the old , the old , the old wild , which is a little bit of a thought , or the other thing that &apos;s going on , and say , these people are
so , native , native are neither a grain of a grain , you &apos;ll be able to be in the pension .
it &apos;s not a lot of space for the most violent , or the cold winds of tibet , but they still have a mystery of the earth , but they &apos;re also shaped by time and ritual , which is not based on the idea of being able
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid from the pharmacy , that &apos;s growing up in believing that the mountain is a computer , which is the mountain , or your destiny , will be a very different person , and another relationship to this resource , and a different
whether he &apos;s a coup of a mind or a bunch of pounds , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that is defined by the individual and nature .
i grew up in the woods of british colombia , and i believed that these forests are there to become a lot of time .
this made me a different person as my friends under the world &apos;s office , who believe that these forests of the coup of the day and the curved spirits are the , and the most prolific spirits , the most powerful spirits that are living on the world
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is a lot of the time of the many of you who have heard the most powerful of the most powerful , the most powerful of the repertoire of the world &apos;s repertoire .
what &apos;s fascinating is not just the most amazing potential of this kind of thing , but it &apos;s going to be made . it &apos;s actually made out of two different sources . on one side , there &apos;s this wooden wooden , which is a series of
this plant contains some very strong things that the serotonin , the serotonin , and the most similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the most sophisticated , like you &apos;ve been able to get this stuff out , this substance that you make from different kinds of species .
this powder is about being shot by a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a bit of a time of the street ,
it &apos;s not going to create a bias of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have with my professor , richard evan , who was the man who &apos;s the most powerful of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the world &apos;s office , and i said , &quot; you know , you can &apos;t put this kind of thing as a
but the thing with the most powerful is that they can &apos;t be taken out of the way that they can be in the human gut , of course , in the human gut , of course , the name of the world &apos;s name .
you can only get into connection with some other chemicals that the mao &apos;s .
now the fascinating thing is that the most important thing that contain in the world &apos;s brain is , the way that we have the way that we have the way that we have the food is that it &apos;s necessary to be able to get the most important
how can these people get from a kenyan species of 80,000 species that are not going to find these two types of plants that are , if they combine this way , a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind
we use this great euphemism , trying and error , which turns out as meaningless .
but you ask the indians , you say , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the most powerful , have 17 varieties of the world that you all see in big distance in the forest that is a kind of view of our eyes as a kind of thing .
and then you ask them how they justify their own , and they say , &quot; i thought you understand something from plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you &apos;re going to take any of the 17 varieties of the 17 varieties of water and sing them in a different way .
now , that doesn &apos;t bring you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than counting .
now , the problem is that even the problem of the people who have the sympathy for the difficult people to be the most difficult to be the native of the native , they &apos;re looking at the past , but they &apos;re kind of just looking at the
so , the fact is that you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century , in 300 years , but in a way , it &apos;s going to be a era of the world that we were in , and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new design systems .
and the problem is not the technology .
the most important thing was to be a little bit less on sioux than they were the bow and arrow , as the americans stopped to be americans when they were the horse and the other tasks .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of the world &apos;s integrity , it &apos;s power . that &apos;s ugly face of the rule .
and wherever you &apos;re in the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures are not the decline of the decline . these are dynamic living peoples , whose existence is being driven by the mud , and the most powerful of the world &apos;s own ,
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m going to go a lot of work , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the most extinct , the most endangered of people , are convicted of people , but the most important thing that the destruction of people are not being convicted of is not just not convicted , but generally , and in general ,
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of tibet if you haven &apos;t experienced it on the ground .
i went to a young colleagues , 6,000 miles of a car of a car in the world &apos;s office , and i was just looking at the back of the statistics , and i was going to see the face behind the statistics that were murdered by the
the father of this young boy was identified as a tag of the day of the surgeon .
that meant that he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle is going to be able to be in the diaspora , the people who brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked up when punishment for -- for the crime of wealthy .
he was in the age of two years in prison to hide under her own , because she couldn &apos;t live it without it .
the sister , the that that was actually a brave , was brought into a computer factory .
one day she came out of a tag , and she had to have a kind of a little bit of a sudden , and it had to be a heavy school station for seven years .
the suffering of tibet can be mathematically , but the most important mind of people is something more powerful .
and at the end , we really stand in front of a choice . do we want to live in a world &apos;s world of the world &apos;s world or in a world of the diversity of the diversity ?
margaret &apos;s great anthropologist , the great anthropologist before she died that it &apos;s the greatest fear that as we &apos;re in direction of a thread , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole range of human imagination , but we &apos;re going to be able to
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species may have been there for 600,000 years .
the main revolution , which brought us the agriculture , and we &apos;re in this moment of the front of the world &apos;s head , the poetry of the most prolific , the poetry of the priesthood , and the hierarchy of the priesthood created , and the hierarchy
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we &apos;re in the next millennia .
if we ask these kinds of things to be human , they &apos;re going to answer 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we will be able to encourage the opportunity to be what we are : people with all consciousness that are aware of the importance that all people and gardens have to flourish , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took on the northern end of the world &apos;s center when i went to the most popular , and this man , i told myself a wonderful story of his grandfather &apos;s book .
the canadian government is not always a very good deal with the inuit and while the most important years in the process of our rule , they were forced to pull in settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the guns and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit don &apos;t have fear before the cold , they used them to their advantage .
the most popular of their own , originally , were made from fish , made in the world .
the man &apos;s grandfather didn &apos;t fear the arctic night or the flying storm .
he &apos;s going out to go out , and he took his pants off , and he was going to go down in his hand , and when the feces started to raise it , he shaped her in the form of a slightly .
he &apos;s going to be a lot of the pages of the world &apos;s pages and when it was completely frozen , he was a dog with it .
he &apos;s a dog , and he was a weekly record , and he took a weekly record , and he was a little bit of a dog , and he was a little bit of a dog , and he was a little bit of a dog on
so you can do anything like that .
and this is a symbol of the sediment of the inuit and all native indigenous on the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april 1999 , the complete control of a field , which is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country and called the so-called water .
it &apos;s an independent area . they &apos;re all controlling the whole .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state , the state of the world , can look for his people and can reach .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are traveling to this distant goals of the earth , to recognize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they &apos;re the most popular of somebody .
they represent parts of human imagination , which went back in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of our own children , are part of the capital of hope .
what we finally try to do in national geographic is that politicians never do something .
we believe that the most powerful -- we believe that the most compelling is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website gets 35 million of them every month
and the other nations are sending our main system .
our magazines are reading by millions .
and we companies are a series of travel in the world that we take our audience to places like this , that they &apos;re blind from the other , and hopefully they &apos;re going to be a little bit of the central revelation of anthropology , that the world
thank you .
what i first do is , as fast as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we have microsoft as part of a thinking , and that &apos;s a place that is going to be a place that you can do , and it &apos;s
we see many , many of the most powerful photographs here , which you &apos;re going to be in , and it &apos;s constantly going to be new , and we can put it on any way , and we can put it in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this is a scan of the library of the library and it &apos;s in a domain of 300 , and it &apos;s in a domain of 300 .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference because the only thing that the performance of a system can be like this is the number of pixels on your screen in every moment , and it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of a computer company .
this is a house house of dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it really is about a text and not a picture , we can do something like that , to really show that this one really representation of the design and no picture is .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a design system .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a case of a case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of one part .
and that &apos;s really what you &apos;re doing , and the good experience of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with several scales .
we also did something on the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a false ad with very high resolution that is much higher than a normal display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technical , or technical .
and this is actually taking these ideas , these limitations for available space on the screen .
we hope that this is not a single one , and other nonsense , that should not be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i &apos;m really not going to spend a lot of time here , except saying that we &apos;re going to be able to do this area .
but these are all roads in the united states .
the top on the top of nasa &apos;s image is nasa .
let &apos;s take something else .
this is even live in the internet . you can do it .
this is a project called the name of the name , which is really two different technologies together .
one is a very good research , and the other is a very good research about the , which is from noah , a college student of university , under the advice of steve , in the university of steve .
and rick &apos;s research was done by microsoft research . a very good collaboration .
so this is live in the internet . it &apos;s driven by the internet .
you can see that if we create this kind of views , where we can penetrate through images and make this experience of the more sophisticated resolution .
but the spatial structure of images is actually meaning in the process of meaning .
the most powerful ones have been held together with this , and they &apos;ve been doing the real space that they were doing in the canadian , which are all in the near the middle of the middle of the canadian , and they &apos;re looking at elements of
i don &apos;t know if i have time to show you other environments .
there are what you &apos;re doing .
i &apos;d like to show you a straight data data of noah , and that &apos;s from a early prototype of the world &apos;s day that we &apos;ve been working on in summer to show you what i think it &apos;s really the punchline behind this technology , which
we had to make ourselves care about the lawyers .
this is a retired of the cathedral of carnegie dame , who was just going to be in the computer with images of flickr , and they just give them a little , and they &apos;ll get pictures of men in t-shirts and they &apos;ll get pictures of men
so this is all the most powerful , and they all stand in the way in relation to each other .
and we can navigate that very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i &apos;m going to work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
and i guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras : everything is to professional the most powerful , a pretty large number of them , which were all in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird .
many of you are blown up faces .
somewhere here is a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster of diana dame , which was recorded right .
we can change the poster of this environment to a physical view of this environment .
the point is that we can do things with social environment , and it will now be set up data from all of the collective memory of how , the whole collective memory of how , visual the earth looks -- and everything will connected together .
all these photos are connected to each other and it creates something bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes out of the earth .
look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen &apos;s earth .
and this is something that is through complexity , which people use it , growing and use the user to use the application of the application .
their own photos are going to be a lot of the other person who has a different person .
if someone has done the trouble and all of these sacred , and they &apos;re telling who they all are , then my photo will suddenly be made by the mammogram , and i can use them as a starting point to use the other of the other players
and of course , byproduct all of these are the immense rich models of each interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not only through the world &apos;s or satellite imagery and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you .
do i understand it right ? your software allows to be a certain time within the next few years , all the images that are used by someone in the world in the world ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t make anything else .
if you want to build them between the images .
and it &apos;s doing this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think of the amount of information that many of these images have .
as if you do a computer company for images , where you &apos;re going to go to sentences and the text of the website is a lot of information about that , which is the picture .
but how would it be , if the picture is connected to all their images ?
then the scale of the world &apos;s scale is the amount of the way that it makes it , really enormous , it &apos;s a classic , very powerful .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , how i hope , in the process of the other things that you &apos;ve heard about , and i &apos;m going to try to create a few connections , if you &apos;re not noticed .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official &quot; .
the official of what ?
the official of all western industrialized societies .
the official of the official is working as well as our goal of the common of our citizens is , it &apos;s all about the most important of the freedom of the individual .
the reason that freedom is good in itself is valuable , useful , sense , a sense of the human .
if people have freedom , each of us is to do things that our public maximize and no one has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more more good they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply , that it would not come to the sense of it .
and it &apos;s also deeply rooted in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what we can do in modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say something about the most important thing .
there are five times in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t get the 10 different extra extra people , and 12 of them can buy them to make a big number of their own own , in which unlikely case is not the one of the most prolific
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the business store to put a stereo -- speaker , a computer , a radio , radio , a radio , radio , and in this one electronics , there &apos;s so many stereo .
we can put millions of different singers out of the components that are offered to be offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a young boy , because you could have a little bit of a phone , and you wanted to have a little bit of a phone , as long as he came from mama bell .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
one consequence of that was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have a infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is the middle -- the most powerful , and the most prolific , and the cuban plaque .
and you should not have seen that until now , you can be sure that you &apos;ll soon be .
and what it does is to run people to run and ask this question .
now , you know what the answer is to be ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that &apos;s very important than buying objects , the same explosion of choice is to be the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s not longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and tell you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could make a make or we could do b .
a has this benefits and risks .
b has this benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a , a has this benefits and risks and b , and b .
what do you want ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not it . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift of responsibility is a shift of responsibility for the difference of the choices of somebody who knows anything -- the patient &apos;s own ,
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like them and me , and that if they think about it , they don &apos;t make any sense of it , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do you advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , you expect us to call the doctor the next morning , asking a change of the prescription .
something like our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide .
we don &apos;t get identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re so often new as we want .
that means that every day you wake up at the morning , you need to decide what a kind of person wants to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where the most common one was that almost every one had one and that they were so fast as they could , and then they got so fast kids like they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that .
now , all of it is just too .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i used to do .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry ?
should i marry later ? should i just have kids , or just career ? &quot;
these are all the questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions regardless of whether that means to make all the tasks i &apos;m going to get to you and not get a good note in my course .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important questions to be asking .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl shows , with technology that allows us to work every minute from every day in every place -- until the top hotel .
there &apos;s a corner of the way that i &apos;m not going to tell you about that , which is the most important thing that &apos;s working on .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of work , again , and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can watch our children playing football , and we have our mobile phone on the one hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and even if you &apos;re all off , every minute in that we &apos;re going to ask our child to be a more successful thing in the face of a computer company , we also should think , &quot; should i think that call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be your experience of your child &apos;s own way , as it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and little things , material things , and lifestyle , is a question of choice .
and the world we lived in was that .
so i want to say , there was some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world we &apos;re going to see now is that we &apos;re going to see .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to be bad about what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , the way that he &apos;s going to get to free .
so with many options you can choose , it &apos;s very hard to decide to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another more of the example of this , a study about investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to the most powerful of the world &apos;s work , the giant , giant , a million employees , about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 year-old one who was offered the employer to put the participation to two percent .
they offer 50 more sophisticated -- 10 percent less employees , and they &apos;re going to take a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of
because it &apos;s 50 more sophisticated , which is to decide that it &apos;s so hard to decide that you &apos;re going to put it on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , it &apos;s never coming .
you know that it &apos;s not just called the people eating food if they go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go to the swim , it means that they &apos;re going to be able to make a big amount of money .
and they &apos;re not giving participation to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the top of the day , which would have been happy to reproduce their contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it &apos;s going to be the world that looks like this .
they really want to make the decision really , if it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment , or they &apos;re going to be the wrong thing .
so this is one effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end less satisfied with the outcome of choice as if we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is that it &apos;s a lot of the big choice of different types of information when you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is a perfectly perfect thing , it &apos;s just a little bit of a decision that &apos;s
the more possibilities there is , the more easier it is not to regret that is a little bit of the choice that you meet .
second , what economists call the .
dan gilbert made a big point of this morning by telling how much the way we evaluate things that we &apos;re comparing to it .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to think about it , it &apos;s just attractive properties of alternative that you &apos;re going to do , that makes you less happy with the alternatives that you &apos;ve chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for the one of you who are not new york , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . they have all of them for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my favorite neighborhood is gone .
i could park directly before my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks of the thought he missed the opportunity , day over day , a great parking parking .
the happiness is lower , the happiness we get through our selection , even if that &apos;s what we &apos;ve chosen .
and the more possibilities that are the choice of the choice of these choices are going to take into the world &apos;s brain .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon makes some of the statements .
he &apos;s going to do a statement about it now and maybe things slowly do things .
but a more important point he &apos;s doing is , always who you choose to decide to do it , you don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things like a lot of attractive properties , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do less powerful .
third : the expectations of expectations .
this has met me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost the whole time .
and there was a time in the way that there was a kind of jeans , and they bought them , and they have bad , they were incredibly reactive and they were very eager to have a long time , and they &apos;ve got a long time ,
so to buy new jeans , to buy a lot of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the guy said , &quot; do you want to be a lot of a sudden , easy or big ?
do you want buttons or a half ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you want to cut down far , and you &apos;re going to cut blah blah , blah , and so on , he said .
my jaw was down and after i recovered , i &apos;d like to have the way that i &apos;d like to do the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent a hour with all these damn jeans , and i got the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best right jeans i ever had .
i had better . all these choices allowed me to have it better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it to myself .
the reason that i felt worse was , with all these kinds of options , my expectations for what a good few jeans is , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations than it was just in a way .
when they came in 100 ways , damn , one of them would have perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i had to get to the thing i expected , and what i had was a cartoonist in comparison to what i expected .
and that &apos;s what we add to the lives of people &apos;s lives , and they inevitably have expectations that are going to be the people that are going to be good about how good these possibilities will be .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world knows this . because , if you would , you don &apos;t know what it is , you know , you don &apos;t know what it is .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is , the sooner thing was better than anything worse than anything was worse than anything was worse for people to do a pleasant surprise .
today in the world we live -- we are wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best for you can ever hope that it &apos;s the things that you &apos;re expecting to do .
they &apos;re never going to be comfortable because their expectations , my expectations , are big .
the secret to the most important -- that &apos;s what they all come -- the secret to the most low are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short time of a moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really very wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have better to do . i don &apos;t have a lot of time .
but it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of the brain &apos;s brain &apos;s bad jeans , if there &apos;s only one kind of buying that if you &apos;re a kind of a little bit of a way , you &apos;re going to be a little bit of the time , and you
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and you buy one of the disappointing , and you ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to ask you .
they could have better to do it .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the landfill , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so if people make decisions , and even if the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed , they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant -- not the only , but a significant thing to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have learned the disappointing because their standards are so high , and then if they have to explain these experiences themselves , they
and so the most important thing is that it &apos;s generally better , and we &apos;re going to feel worse , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official , the official , which we all think of right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s better than no , but it doesn &apos;t follow , but it doesn &apos;t follow more choices than something .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point long at the choice of our public .
now , as a rule , i &apos;m almost finished -- as a rule , the thing that is about thinking about the way that it &apos;s all of these choices is that the material is the wealth of wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them , who is not to make the problem too big .
your problem is that you have too little .
so things that i &apos;m talking about is a curious problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry is : steve ariely tells you about how these expensive and hard car seats don &apos;t help to help the car seats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
they even hurt .
they &apos;re worried about that we &apos;re getting worse .
if something of the people who allow our society to make decisions in the societies that are going to have a little bit of choice , wouldn &apos;t only be the life of people , but our dignity will be improved .
economists call this a very popular application .
so , the most important thing is that it &apos;s going to be better -- not only the poor -- because all these big choices are going to be more accurate .
finally , read this cartoon , and , a advanced person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this kind of thing . &quot;
and the unfolding imagination , a computer view of the world -- and that it &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the point that the fish knows something .
because the truth is that if you break the most powerful , it &apos;s possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the most powerful , it &apos;s possible to reduce the happiness .
they increase the paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a computer system .
this is almost with perfect security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the most important thing is , the most powerful thing is a recipe for misery , and i suspect disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about human genome and what that might mean , and about the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology and now we try to get from the digital code in a new phase of biology by designing new life and build new lives .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve been covering almost 20 years . when we sequenced the design of the analog world , the change of the analog world of biology is the digital world of the computer .
now , let &apos;s try to ask if we can regenerate whether we can make life or whether we can create new life from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , nonviolent , which has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we tried to get it to a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it on about a hundred genes of the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at these metabolic map , that &apos;s very simple , compared to our . trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we &apos;re all looking at these genes that we can eliminate one after the other , it would lead to a living
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to go forward to the front of this chromosome , which allows us to vary the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we get a chromosome ?
does it allow the chemistry to make this really big molecules , which has never been done before ?
and , if we can , we can start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
our steps at the study of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code is very slow , but yet , we would have increased , and our final point would be going to be a exponential curve .
we started with this 15 years ago .
it actually took some years to a review of a review of a review before we did the first experiments .
and it turns out , it &apos;s very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines that can make the little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a kind of a process that you &apos;re doing , the longer you do a piece , the more mistakes .
so we had to develop a new way of putting these little pieces and the mistakes to correct the mistakes .
this was our first attempt to start with the digital information , the genome phi x .
it &apos;s a little virus killing bacteria .
we made small pieces , made a error error and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of a chemical chemical , and in a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then thrown from the cells and came back and killed e. sessions .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said they were going to understand this model right .
they laughed more than their own .
so we think that &apos;s a situation in the software actually can build its hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go to a lot of time . we wanted to build a whole bit of the chromosome , and it has more than a lot of the letters of genetic code , so we thought we &apos;re building it in a deck of the size
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information really has to be accurate .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the most prolific one was a mistake in a 10,000 base base .
we found 30 mistakes , and if we had used the original sequence , it never had been possible .
part of the design is to create pieces of the 50 letters long , and they have to overlap with other kinds of pieces of pieces to build smaller amounts of water that fit this .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve been building it .
think about it : we have a computer code : a , c , g and t. .
and this letter -- this letter , this letter , is about 20 amino acids ; there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we just have signed up .
some people were disappointed that it was no poetry .
we &apos;ve designed the pieces that we could just break them up with enzymes , and there are enzymes that repair these and together .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces of the five to the other letters , and they put these together together to make these together , to make them put together to the other , until to get to the ground .
in every step we have this pieces in the surplus , we could sequence them because we tried to create a very robust process of what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get the point of the world &apos;s point .
so , this looks like a computer company .
if we get to this right big bits -- with 100,000 pairs of pair -- then these aren &apos;t just growing in e. sessions . it &apos;s all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we &apos;ve been in other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of the most popular , which is using biology to repair dna that can bring pieces of pieces to the things that can bring these pieces .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s a organism called the most prolific of the three million rads of radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything has been put together as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely dried , they can even live in the vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life in space can be , and it can move to the search for spreading conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a computer company that we &apos;ve made by using this processes -- actually we &apos;ve used this processes , and we &apos;ve just used it to the right design of the pieces of pieces , and yeast is going to be automatically combined . yeast is going
this is not a regular amount of water .
it &apos;s a big molecule that we can even see it with the most powerful .
these are images about a long six seconds .
that &apos;s the publication we &apos;ve just done recently .
these are about the letters of the letters of the code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with the structure of the structure that has ever been created by people .
it has a computer of 300 million .
if we would print it with a computer of 10 and without distances , it would be a lot of the pages of the pages , just to get this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus , it &apos;s a lot more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier when you &apos;re in the way we &apos;re doing it , you just take the nucleus out and there &apos;s another one in the way that you &apos;ve heard all of the time , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about that .
in the way , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but only recently we showed that you can do a full transplant of a chromosome to another and that can activate this .
we were beaten the chromosome of a computer company , and it &apos;s a little bit like people , and we were going to give up a few of them , and we were giving some of the things that we could choose to choose this chromosome , and
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we tried to get the process further .
this is the most popular of evolution here .
we &apos;re all finding the species of species here , or a third of the world &apos;s first chromosome , and every time thousands of characteristics in just one second to a species of a species .
so people who think evolution is changed as a gene that has changed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called the most powerful , which actually is dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no one ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve added .
it was in the cell , and it realized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so we had only a cell with a new chromosome .
it &apos;s the blue of the genes that we &apos;ve added .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species , and it turned completely into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- as we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we have .
it may sound like genomic &apos;s sound , but we can do that by moving the most dramatic , things quite dramatic .
now i argued that this is not the most popular -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years .
and i &apos;ve been suggesting that we might be able to create a new form of the world &apos;s own explosion in the process that could be massive new design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re in the next 40 billion people in the next 40 years .
to ask it in my context : i was born in 1879 .
today , three people in this planet have been in 1879 for each one in the year , in 40 years , and within 40 years it will be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
it will offer a challenge for 9 .
we need about five billion tons of coal , and we need billions of water drums of oil , and that &apos;s a hundred million drums of water .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace it , it will be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s the whole co2 of this material in the atmosphere .
we now have , from our discoveries of all over the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the most popular ones that are the future of the future .
the most popular , a dozen components , and you see the diversity of that .
we &apos;re going to go in the first line of the biological reality and the idea of our imagination .
we have technologies today because of this fast , to do what we call the genetics , which we call the genetics .
we have now the opportunity to build a big robot in the day of the chromosomes .
if you imagine that 20 million different genes , or to optimize these processes to make the world &apos;s population , or drugs , we can change a little bit more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just a little bit of selection . we can get to the design of the production , production of chemicals or the more of the chemicals and so on .
this is a shot of real , which we &apos;re working on , with the one that you &apos;re actually running in and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to look like it . we know exactly how to look like your genetic code .
we &apos;re now focusing on fuel in the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn recently , which is just a bad experiment .
we have fuels of the world &apos;s disease and third generation that will be relatively soon , and the most higher , the most higher , as a lot of the other species of the world &apos;s disease .
but , as we think the only way that biology is a big impact without more increase of the cost of food or the limitation of their availability , if we see co2 as a result , we &apos;re going to work on cells that are going to go
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first with the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method --
but in our discovery of the world , we all have different ways of different ways .
this is an organism we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about a mile , in almost a little bit of a sudden , in almost a little bit of a time .
it &apos;s turning co2 into methane to use hydrogen as energy source .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use co2 co2 , which could just be brought into the way that we could get to the fuel , and that &apos;s what the co2 could make in fuel to make this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- the goals of the entire dependence like the substitute of the entire urbanization industry , right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where otherwise ? a key amount of energy .
but we &apos;re working on this right now , the same approaches for development of vaccines .
they saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year back , and we have a dollar to little , if it &apos;s about the right vaccine .
i think that &apos;s going to be changed by creating vaccines in the most powerful .
this is how the future might look like the future , can be accelerated today , and today , the most powerful thing is to be accelerating with synthetic bacteria , and maybe the most powerful .
we &apos;re more than improving people from the way to improve , and our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
and at the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised back to explain to you how the machine works .
so , it &apos;s as far as it &apos;s . and for all those who are not there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that was ever the previously -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that have less than a second second of the universe -- and that &apos;s to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking .
this is the machine below geneva .
we take images of these kinds of things in detectors .
and i &apos;m working on this work . he calls atlas detector -- 44 feet in the width , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction that you see the scale .
at the 10th of september last year , the machine went to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it &apos;s caused huge amounts of control in control control .
it &apos;s a picture of the first ted company that the entire track of the lhc is going to put on the lhc , and then to make a part of the lhc , to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture at the 10th of september , we knew that the machine works , what is a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was created the biggest most powerful , or that , when someone went to the google side and the front page .
it means we reached a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires here -- this golden wires here .
these wires lead to the world &apos;s machine when the machine goes on on the ground .
now the engineers under them are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , they don &apos;t do it . that &apos;s little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you &apos;re very comfortable , you &apos;ll be called the so-called &quot; you &apos;re going to be very cool . &quot;
so in minus , the way that the space between the stars , you can get these wires to the tension .
in one of the connections between the sea , between the magnet , there was a computer company .
so , it &apos;s a little bit of the wires , and it &apos;s all the way that we &apos;ve been doing it , and it &apos;s all the electric resistance .
this was the result .
now , that &apos;s really wonderful when you imagine that the magnet weigh over 20 tons and shifted around about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we &apos;re guilty of them , they &apos;re going to be a new thing .
they &apos;re all back to their way back .
and the end of march is going to be more nuanced .
we will turn it out , and expect to be the first data in june or july , and we &apos;re going to go to the journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in a way , these accidents are again , the debate of science and engineering in such borders , it &apos;s easy to reject something .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to reach the fact that we &apos;re going to reach beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words to a english scientist , and i &apos;m going to leave the world , which i suspect when he was holding the research experiments of his favorite , his apprentice , was michael &apos;s , which said , &quot; nothing is
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
and to write books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my great , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change that .
but the recent thing is , the recent thing is , in my life , and my career happened to be completely to rethink my own work .
this curious event was that recently i wrote a book recently -- a biography called the &quot; a biography of &quot; the &quot; a &quot; a &quot; a &quot; a &quot; -- &quot; that , decided to do that , and that &apos;s a big thing to do ,
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to get treated , i &apos;m treated as if i &apos;m going to be the decline .
seriously -- the decline of the decline !
for example , you &apos;re going to be concerned about me , and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you never will be able to get this success ?
have you not fear that you &apos;re going to make your entire life and never create a book that anyone in the world is interested in ? never again ?
okay , that &apos;s really what makes it courage .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago when i told the first time i was going to be a teenager , and i was going to be a writer with the same kind of plastic response .
people said , &quot; did you not fear , never succeed ?
did you not fear that you kill the humiliation of a letter ?
you don &apos;t fear that you &apos;re going to be able to get your life for your life and never come out and you &apos;re going to die on a computer factory , and you &apos;re going to die on a computer factory , your mouth of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : the very short answer .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had .
and i &apos;ve been afraid of a lot more things that nobody would have a clue .
as algae -- and other scary things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it , and i ask myself why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that someone should be expected to do that , to do the work he feels to do ?
and what &apos;s exactly about the creative enterprises that they &apos;re going to make us insecure about the relationship of the brain system -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemists and i can &apos;t remember the situation in his 40 years as a chemist , in which he was asked if he was scared to be chemists .
with your favorite , john -- how do you go to this ?
it just didn &apos;t come , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not been given the reputation of the people &apos;s disease .
we have a writer , but we have this kind of reputation , but not only the writers , but the creative of all the teenagers , seem to be mentally unstable .
everything you need to do is look at the bitter , really great minds of the 20th century , which died young and often from the own hand .
and even the ones who don &apos;t actually have a lot of the time , seemed to be really neglected by their talents .
norman : shortly before his death in his last interview , i was going to have a little bit more likely to get a little bit more .
a remarkable statement that you can do about your life life .
but we don &apos;t even have a lot of time when we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve been familiar with this kind of speech for so long , and somehow we have the notion of that , and the collective , creativity and suffering , is
the question i want to ask every one is : is this idea for you all right ?
feel that it &apos;s probably a centimeter , because with just one centimeter , i don &apos;t feel that this notion of all of you .
i find them a lot of the way .
and i find you dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how you &apos;ve taken in the next century .
i think it &apos;s better if we encourage our big creative to live .
and i definitely know that it &apos;s for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , start to start this dark path of the guess , especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career .
that &apos;s called -- you see , i &apos;m quite young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 more of the time .
and it &apos;s very likely to be that everything i &apos;m going to write from now from the world is the work that was going to be the work of my last book , right ?
i say it &apos;s a little bit of a time , because we &apos;re all kind of friends here -- it &apos;s very likely to be the most important success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thought that you can get to the other , to drink nine o &apos;clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to .
i would still continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of the most important , i seem to be able to write to be able to create a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind
somehow i have to find out of a way to write a safe distance to true between me and my very natural , very natural , like the reaction to the writing .
while i &apos;ve been looking for models for the last year , i &apos;ve been looking for the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if you might have better or more or more , more and more of the ideas that are connected
this search led me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me because the circle will end again .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a permanent source of the people who come from a distant , unknown source .
the greeks called this divine , the creativity of creativity , the arts &apos;s fingers .
from socrates , he &apos;s known that he believed he had a computer company who was going to be able to give him a lot of the way to get him out of it .
the roman idea had the same idea , called this kind of a of creative mind , a genius of the creative genius .
this is great . the roman thought didn &apos;t really think a genius was a particularly clever individual .
they believed that a genius was the kind of magical , of the object that was literally living in the walls of a computer -- about like the same as a little bit of the time , the most powerful , the most powerful and the artist in the
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s this , because it &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological construction that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked like this , right ?
the artist of the computer &apos;s artist was protected by some things , like , for example , too much more , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t have anything to look at for you , everybody knew you had this kind of genius genius that helped you .
if your work is going to be a work -- not completely your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew your genius was paralyzed .
so people really have a long time about creativity .
and then the renaissance came and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- about all gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no place for the mystic creatures
it &apos;s the beginning of rational , and people started thinking that creativity was completely from their individual individual .
for the first time in history , people hear this or the artist who call a genius -- instead of that , he &apos;s got a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think to allow a naked person that he thinks he &apos;s like the vessel , like the shell and the essence and the source of all the divine , creative , unknown , infinite mystery , is a little bit more responsibility to make you
it &apos;s like asking someone to eat the sun .
the leader and distorted all the egos and it creates all these boxes to success .
i think that this is the most 500 of our artists that have been wiped out the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question : is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and mystery of creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just have a more rational of 500 years of being rational in a very violent talk .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience who would really be able to be a scientific scientific doubt about the notion of -- basically -- the people who are inspired and the people who are doing it and they &apos;re using their projects and they &apos;re using their
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to do is , why not ?
why not think about this ?
because it makes a lot of sense of how anything else i &apos;ve heard , when it was about explaining the absolute crazy , the creative process of the creative process .
a process that &apos;s going to be -- like everybody knows that it &apos;s ever trying to do something -- so in other words : in other words , it &apos;s not always reasonable .
in fact , he can actually feel a really more powerful thing .
i had a very encounter , and i had a encounter as i met the extraordinary american poet , which is now about 90 , but she told me that she was growing up in the field of virginia , she told me that she was growing up in
she said it would be like a train train from air .
the country on them would be in the country .
she felt if it came , because it would bring the earth under your feet to the earthquake .
she knew she could just do one of the time , and that was -- in her words -- in her words -- the devil &apos;s race , like the devil .
she ran like the devil to the house as she was tracking from this poem , and it was just about that she had to get fast enough to a sheet of paper and a pen that was going to be able to get it through her , and
in other paint , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house and she was going to go through it and she was going to go through the ground and she was going to go through the
and then there was these moments -- the part i never forget -- she said that there were moments in which they were almost given it .
so , she runs to the house and search after paper and the poem , and it &apos;s going through you and it &apos;s just going to take a pen as it &apos;s through her and then -- she said -- she was like her other hand , and
they caught the poem on his tail and moved it back into their body and took it into the sheet of paper .
and this is the poem that came up with the poem , and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
when i heard that , i thought that &apos;s a very scary -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going to happen .
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a computer company . to work on the same time , i have to stand up every day and sweat , and i really uncomfortable and really uncomfortable .
but even i &apos;ve been in my favorite school , sometimes this thing was packed .
and i guess that many of you have done that too .
even i had work or ideas that made out of a source of me , which i can &apos;t identify .
what is this one thing ?
and how do we get to losing our minds without losing our minds , but even to keep us in mental health ?
for me , the best living example of how you can do this is the musicians tom &apos;s , and i was allowed to interview him a few years ago .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of the time of his life was tom the embodiment of the modern modern artist who was trying to be able to be able to get these things to be able to be able to be able
but then he became older and quiet . he told me he went to a synapse in los angeles , and there &apos;s everything for him .
he went to the high speed when he suddenly hears a little array of a melody , which is how to often be in inspiration for him , for a very difficult material , and he wants to have it . it &apos;s a lot of the time ,
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen ; he doesn &apos;t have a little bit of a time .
so he starts to go up , and it &apos;s going to go up to the old , like , i &apos;m going to lose this thing and will be tracking by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of getting out of panic , he just heard .
he finished all the time and did something completely new .
he just looked at the sky and said , &quot; sorry , can you &apos;t see that i &apos;m going to drive car ? &quot;
so , i think , &quot; i &apos;m going to see a song that i &apos;m going to write in a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a little bit of a moment , if i can take care of you .
if not , you &apos;re going to do somebody else .
go and get a pastor indra .
his whole process has changed after that .
not the work itself . that was still as dark as you &apos;ve ever seen and ever .
but the process and the heavy , the heavy , the heavy , was , he was a genius of the genius , where he was not allowed to be able to do anything as trouble and then where he came out of it , and he realized that
it could be a strange , surprising , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the strange , more powerful thing that wasn &apos;t very tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit like i worked and it has saved me .
this idea saved me as i was in the middle of the world &apos;s middle of the world &apos;s office , and i was going to be a love of doubt , and i fell in one of these frames of doubt in the way we all fall in
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just be able to get the project out .
but then i remembered how tom was talking to the free sky , and i tried it .
so i raised my view of manuscript and i spoke to my comment towards a empty corner of the room .
i talked about , &quot; listen , you know , you know , you &apos;re both , and i know both if this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i &apos;m all , i &apos;m investing , invest . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to put up here and follow your percentage of deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , then the hell .
i &apos;m going to write further , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you a little bit of the jobs that i was here for my part of the jobs .
because ... -- at the end , it &apos;s like following . centuries ago , in the deserts of the people , in the deserts , people were gathered in the deserts of the world , and they were gathered up with the dawn of the time -- until
these strong were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , very rare , something special happened . one of the actors actually became a lot of the performer .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve seen all of your life once , you know , you &apos;ve seen a performance .
it was as if the time was going to be a kind of time and the dancers through a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a
and suddenly , he didn &apos;t realize more than more .
he was light in the inside and down and light down and everything is going through a complete fire .
as something happened at the time , people knew what this was . they called it in his name .
they put together the hands together , and they started singing , and they started singing , and they were , the , , the god , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historical , as the most interesting thing , they took this practice , they had this practice . the subjective , the curvature of the centuries of the centuries of the centuries of the centuries of the centuries of the centuries of the centuries of the centuries of
if a performer in spain is something impossible , something magical has done : the blink of the , the , the , the , , the , , the , , you know , is a little bit of a little bit , and it &apos;s a little
and that &apos;s great because we need this .
but , the tricky part is the next morning when the dancers wake up and recognizes that 11 o &apos;clock is at a tuesday -- and he doesn &apos;t have a more powerful of god in the way .
he &apos;s just an aging of the head of the knee , and maybe he will never get to this heights .
and maybe someone will never call god &apos;s name , if he turns out , but what &apos;s he going to do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most popular things that are a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be very full of the total , if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence is coming from you .
if you might think that you &apos;re a loan -- from a spectacular source for a time of your life , which is passed on somebody else , if you &apos;re done with it .
if we start thinking about this , it changes all this .
so i started thinking and i think , with security in the past months , while i worked on the book , that &apos;s soon going to appear -- as the dangerous , scary , strong , very expected to be a lot of my favorite success .
what i &apos;ve got to say is , if i &apos;m going to be crazy , i &apos;m not afraid .
not a little bit of a little bit .
just make your job .
it &apos;s still for your contribution , whatever he might be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the dumb divine genius , you &apos;re asking you to show you a little bit of wonder , to show a kind of wonder of wonder through your effort , then the more powerful thing .
and if not , dance , you &apos;re dance .
and the most powerful thing , and the most important thing for you , for you , is in terms of you .
i think it &apos;s a feeling , and i feel that we should teach this .
and the most important thing is , for you , for you , for you , for you , you just have the mere human love and the most prolific , for that , to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
and the most powerful !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic , the arctic , the arctic , the size of the lower 48 states , has increased 40 percent of the size of the lower 48 states .
but this doesn &apos;t push very enough enough to do the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic heart is the very hard heart of our global health system .
it grows in winter and it &apos;s in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a computer company that &apos;s happening in the last 25 years .
the most popular thing is with red .
as you see , it grows on the dark dark , this is the annual ice in winter ; and it &apos;s going to be in summer .
this is called the so-called five years old or older , almost like blood , which is from the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here .
this is a problem , because warming is the frozen reason to be the arctic ocean in the arctic ocean , where there is big amounts of carbon dioxide , which is if he &apos;s going to be able to get out of microbes , from microbes .
compared to the whole amount of the way in the atmosphere , that &apos;s the amount of magnitude , if we cross this critical point .
now , in some flat lakes , in alaska , methane of itself is in alaska .
professor &apos;s walter walter walter der the university of the university in alaska with another group of the last winter .
wow !
you &apos;re going to be good . the question is , how will it be a mess .
and one reason is , this enormous heat is converted out of greenland from the north .
this is a year of a year .
but the volume are much bigger than ever before .
this is the most profound river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the sea level goes through the sea of the sea , it &apos;s going to be a sea .
these rivers are taking fast .
the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest most important thing on the planet .
last month , researchers , the entire continent now has a negative amount of negative .
and the most powerful , which showed over a few of the things that came up with a few of the things is very strong .
this is 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the most powerful , you see the top of the new lakes , you see a few of the rays that were a few years ago .
40 percent of all people on the world get half of their own life of the world .
in the pharmacy , this glacier is the most powerful for these city .
the most sophisticated ones have increased .
but if you &apos;re going to get the most water , most of the water goes down .
in california , a 40 percent reduction was seen in the sierra world .
this is the most important thing .
and the predictions , as you read them , are serious .
this is the whole world &apos;s population in the world , to fire .
and the disasters everywhere in the world have never been a really more competitive and previously , and before it never has unprecedented degree .
four times in the last 30 years , like in the world &apos;s world .
this is a completely profound thing .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it &apos;s going to be .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 , all 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons every day in the oceans .
look at the eastern pacific of the eastern pacific , the american continent , western and sanitation of indian , where there &apos;s a radical decline of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , next to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning by fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the nevertheless biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest most popular , together with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot of more .
but we start seeing a change .
here are the ones that were taken down in the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
and there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the main thing and the most powerful and the most powerful dollars has spent a dollar , to provide clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me about something .
to go around christmas , at home , in tennessee , a billion tons of light .
they &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is in our entire country of the world &apos;s country .
this happened to christmas .
one of the commercials of the most prolific to christmas was this .
the most powerful thing is a very happy , happy fellow .
there &apos;s a lot of the skin in the skin and the abundance of the world , and it helps to grow our economy .
and the most common thing is that the most cleaner is going to be clean every day .
he &apos;s affordable and the workers , and workers stay in their own and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful thing is the ladder of the world &apos;s head .
let me say one very clear . al gore , nancy &apos;s , harry , harry , you know , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate change has been called two people in life .
this is one part of her .
in the most popular , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
so we put it on the top of the top , a significant amount of energy , to get a major amount of energy on the way to get the truth over coal .
the fact is , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s also good .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s leave it quiet .
and it &apos;s a lot of coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean , clean .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean water .
and yet , the burning of coal of one of the main causes of global warming is the remarkable clean system that you see here , changing everything .
look at it exactly , this is the today today , clean , clean .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security is .
america is in a crisis that economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread , which all connects to this , is our dependence from the fuel of fuel , as dirty coal and the oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us from this kind of thing .
and the u.s. american , with 100 percent clean electricity , within the next 10 years .
a plan to bring america back to work , to make us safer and help to stop global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
and the american american is new . find more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a government of america .
one of the fastest ways of the most of our dependence , dirty fuels , which are our world , to reduce .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments , to create good jobs .
and the american american is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to come far , you go together . &quot;
we have to come far , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start to ask you to ask the time of your childhood when she played with a computer company .
while you realized how to expand the hands and put the hands , the most powerful and moving , they actually learned to think and change problems through understanding and change the value of the value .
the spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- with my favorite , and my colleagues , i started to wonder , i started to wonder , what if we could use computers , and they could make it physically , and they
this question was so moving that we decided to explore the answer and the answer .
and i said , a little bit of a computer &apos;s worth of a computer &apos;s size .
you can get to your hand , you can see each other , you can detect your movements and you have a screen and you have a screen and a computer .
much more importantly , are physically , why you can just move them through the reach of the hands and access to the hands .
and the most important one is an example of a new generation of the manipulation of the manipulation of the range of digital data .
and if these tools are going to be physical and a conscious awareness for their movements , each other can recognize and the edges of our own , and then we can start with the study of new and more confident .
i start with some simple examples .
this is the most important thing for the most powerful , and if i go to a direction , it &apos;s going to play the video forward ; if i go to the other direction , it goes backwards .
and this interactive portraits take each other true .
so if i put them side-by-side , they &apos;re going to get their interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the ones , you notice that , and you can get something nervous .
and they feel also their movements and slope .
a interesting consequence of interactions that we started to see was that we could apply everyday gestures to data , like color , as you do with the fluid .
in this case , we have three main types of energy , and i can use them to put color in the middle of the middle where they &apos;re going to mix .
if we &apos;re going to stop it , we can get a little bit of a little bit more nuanced .
there are also some nice opportunities in education like languages , math or more , where we give people the opportunity to try and see the results of fast and the results immediately .
here i am ... this is a fibonacci number i &apos;m making with a simple computer system .
this is a game with words that is kind of a mixture of a mixture of the brain and the kind of kind of a mixture of the way .
basically , you get any round of the round of the world &apos;s own letters , and while you try to form words , these about a dictionary is tested .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , it &apos;s going to be generated and you have a new amount of design and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came up on a trip to the media lab , and i could move them to try and do it , and they took a video of it .
they really loved it .
a more interesting fact of this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
everything you have to say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another few people who test it .
this is our youngest world &apos;s top on the right .
it turns out he wanted to just stack up the most sophisticated .
so for him , they were just a little bit more .
this is a interactive thing .
we wanted to develop a computer company for a computer company .
this is a retired .
he can bring new characters into the scene by putting the world &apos;s book off the table , which shows this character .
here he is going to get the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he &apos;s going to take a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the most popular and she can put it side-by-side , he can interact with the characters ...
... his own story invent .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end and he can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example i &apos;ve been doing today is to show it a little bit of a time of a design that we &apos;ve been developing , and in the most powerful , as a sound , as a sound , bass and drums .
every one has four different variations ; you can pick up what you want to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can put in any pattern .
and you &apos;re going to be a , you know , by just holding a little bit of a time of a computer .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filters .
you connect it with a certain note and then you &apos;re going to be able to hire it .
and then even more than speed , and volume that you &apos;re using on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s look at .
we start to start in the world &apos;s most powerful , and we &apos;re going to expand these in a series of a series , and they expand a little more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something more drums .
and now i &apos;m going to plug the filter with the drums , so i can control the effect of life .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by putting the speed into one or another direction .
and now i &apos;m going to plug the filter with the bass , for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as you &apos;re going to change .
so , i don &apos;t have to plan to do it in the front of it , but it can be improvise ; they &apos;re expanding or cut .
and finally , i can pick the whole sequence by the left of the left .
thank you .
so how you can see , my excitement is to develop new design , which is better to fit to how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new computer and some of the possibilities that we work in in our lab .
the idea i want to give you on the way is that we &apos;re at the threshold of this new generation of the interaction of the interaction with digital media , which is the information that we &apos;re doing in our world .
thank you .
i &apos;m very pleased to talk to you all .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;m very pleased to do that .
yeah , so what should be a little bit of the time ?
i &apos;ve got to step back a little bit , and it &apos;s a little bit more powerful with modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology and i &apos;ve been doing a few years of the most powerful , and i &apos;ve been starting to do that because i just wanted to know , and it was also going to be even more important , and i wanted to do it
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was an curiosity and i wanted to get closer to the matter , so .
i think the molecular biology in general now , so generally speaking , biotechnology , everything you count to , synthetic biology and so on , so on , and so on , so on .
extremely important is , now , very important , and much more importantly , it will be much more important in the future .
there &apos;s so much things like this all of these things that are genetically modified in the world &apos;s brain .
now there are craig venter in the most violent , trying to make the food of algae , so gas from algae .
and then there &apos;s also things that have been completely in the everyday life , which is most people not aware of , but for example , the most people who allow us to wash them with 40 degrees of laundry are also genetically modified enzymes .
and the list can continue to go around .
and so from the interest of this technology , i &apos;m just on this technology , i &apos;m going to go on .
so what &apos;s going on ?
most people know the most people that are coming out of the world &apos;s office .
computers , and then it will always be like this , yes , the hackers break somewhere , and they &apos;re going to get a little bit of data and so on .
this is kind of very sad for the most powerful , because it doesn &apos;t really exist what they actually started , and what &apos;s actually about it .
and that &apos;s the most important thing that &apos;s going on in the &apos; 70s , and it &apos;s also started with the internet , and it &apos;s also made the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and the problem that is not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a kind of a design problem , which is how things simplify , so a question of a question , and how can you do that
and it was just the software that was made with software , but there &apos;s also a whole bit of a whole bit of a whole , because there &apos;s also a whole whole kind of a whole whole thing that &apos;s going to do with the whole possible
and now , just in terms of biology , and i want to go to this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , that biology is actually a more powerful code , because , the most powerful code is a abstract code , which is , it &apos;s not
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also code and you can also program it , and it &apos;s also a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit , and i found that i was going to find incredibly fascinating
this actually has a few of the things that have been accepted , these networks .
there &apos;s a little bit of the case of the u.n. , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with cooperation in india , but in india , and the women who have been in the world , but the women who have been in
these are a more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and in collaboration with scientists with scientists , and they &apos;re doing that with these technologies , and they &apos;re doing the creative , and they &apos;re doing it , and they &apos;re
but it &apos;s always about finding a kind of a more powerful access to finding a playful deal with it .
and then there &apos;s a little bit of the case of the water , and then there &apos;s a little bit of the water .
this is from the most popular , which is actually more such a kind of forum where you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be and talking online .
and these are a little bit of technical , and also a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of time , because then they &apos;re going to be used
and from these networks that made the whole popular thing , it &apos;s been developed as a scene that i &apos;d like to be able to get out of .
here in the picture on the left , you see the top of the top , which is a kind of a school , so basically a kind of school , a private school , a private school , the institution , where everybody can get .
children , old , all kinds of people go to the way to just get to the way they &apos;re going to be able to put them in a lab and look at what can you do when these are the most powerful ones .
here &apos;s a group down there in indonesia , called the , which is , there &apos;s a very long time .
and more than these other two networks .
and the deal of a artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , also , and combine it in quite a way of doing it .
a group of alessi that i met before a while ago , which is a little bit of a time that would be a public , which is what you want to learn to do in college , which is what you learn in college , and you &apos;ve
and i have a lecture on the other picture in copenhagen in the medical museum in copenhagen museum in a combination of a exhibition .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s most of the young people , but the only thing that is actually all the most common , is that fascination in the technology .
and what you can do with this , and also , in the society , is to ask and ask , so , okay , what do you know what you want to do , you have interest to do that ?
so , okay , to make biology now , you need a material .
you need of course biological materials , and you need tools , and it &apos;s also a lab .
or , what you normally understand under a lab that &apos;s kind of kind of a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of a lot of the machines , extremely expensive , extremely , extremely distance , very , very educated , very educated
and our approach was just to say , okay , that actually , you don &apos;t have to do that .
this is not necessary because every one of each other has actually developed the other technology , and the most of the time that it &apos;s actually a lot of technology that &apos;s like most of the time that is really like that .
and the o one with this premise with this premise , then , for example , brian &apos;s , is trying to put a computer , and then put a computer company , and then , a little bit of a time , and it &apos;s been made ,
so every one that &apos;s already a soup of the way that he &apos;s left to long , also done .
i tried to go home in my lab , a little bit of push , and then i &apos;d just bought the ebay of ebay and made a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a time ,
that &apos;s not supposed to be a joke now , but .
here in the picture , you see the lab , in the world , so it &apos;s such a kind of a garage garage with that , which has a group of the university that &apos;s going to have the university of the university , which is what &apos;s
and this is a little bit called the one that &apos;s mentioned , and this is a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of
and yes , so you see it &apos;s relatively diverse , so that &apos;s the very relatively diverse , which is the time that you &apos;re doing that alone , until the big organizations that are going to be able to do more of the time in the form
but always the approach that it &apos;s just going to be , and it &apos;s going to be accessible .
the first project we &apos;ve done as international group , when we were actually aware of ourselves , is okay , there &apos;s now a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re going to know the people that are always going to be a lot
and then , from the most popular website , the founder of the founder , and he said , well , we have to really meet ourselves , and then , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , very much
and then , there was also that , yes , who are we , who are we like what we want , what do we want to tell ?
and what are our values and what are our purpose , our foundation ?
and then we &apos;ve got a little bit of a sudden .
this was quite intuitive , so everybody has just got his wishes , his and what it &apos;s going to be , and then , you know , then .
and there was , i think , a very good code .
and then we &apos;re not making it , but that &apos;s just , i think , i think , it &apos;s pretty good , and that &apos;s pretty good to be able to get people right .
and we even tried to get the academic world back to the academic world , but there &apos;s somehow not that .
so i think we &apos;re in the way that we &apos;re actually a step further than the academic world .
yeah , what do we do now ?
a project i did with the most popular in switzerland was that we wanted to build a so-called optical case or optical , and we wanted to build a so-called optical .
this is when you focus on a laser beam on a room , you can capture little particles in the air , or in the liquid and then moving into this focus , so that &apos;s a little bit like a kind of a kind of a kind of
this works really , that &apos;s made in academic , and we thought , well , that &apos;s what we might have , and then we &apos;ve got a webcam , and then you have a webcam that &apos;s going to be a lens , the lens , the
it looks down there .
and then we have a very reactive onion , and the costumes put the laser up and then try to focus on this camera .
and that &apos;s not what it does , but we &apos;ve learned much about it .
so another project that &apos;s made from the french group of paris , that &apos;s worked , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and it &apos;s so much , so a little bit of a time , so that a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a bit of a time , and so it &apos;s a little bit of a time , and it &apos;s been
he &apos;s got this helmet built there , and in cooperation with the museum , it was the museum .
then there were the visitors in the room , and they were going to put on this chair , and they put this helmet .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought , or how they thought , is different lights in the room .
was a pretty nice project .
another thing from the united states , which is also to do with this kind of thing , is the most powerful , that &apos;s the visceral , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , to reproduce , to reproduce , to reproduce , to reproduce , so you can make it visible .
so if i do that , the most popular thing on the crime scene , then they go to the , and then they &apos;re going to get a lot of the way that they &apos;re going to do this method , and then they can say , okay
and the machines that make something that are pretty expensive , they &apos;re going to go to commercial , the cheapest ones go to the top of the surface .
and that &apos;s not the most exciting thing , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be very much .
so this is just an application of many that you can do with it .
and they have two two builders , and they said , okay , we &apos;re doing easier and cheaper , and then they have open source , so free hardware , and they &apos;re now getting the cheapest of the cheapest of these devices around the world .
i think that &apos;s a little bit like six dollars or something .
but in case , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely in a frame where it &apos;s going to be clear .
so , i think it &apos;s a very powerful hack .
a project i started recently was to build a computer company .
and it &apos;s a way of doing it , yes , like a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a little bit like this , two
you invites the most powerful , and then you put the most powerful in these things , and then i &apos;ve got the most sophisticated and then put it on the nanoscale and then put it on the light .
so the device you see there is not working .
but this is my prototype , but that &apos;s pretty wild , and so on a branch , that &apos;s what the thing is about , electronics , and pressure , and that was the pressure , and it was the pressure to go up , and it was
and then i took a little bit of a sudden and that &apos;s what it was connected to .
a computer , if you do the full thing with water , has the enough pressure , so i think 40 to the mountain bar is about on top of it .
and then you can accelerate the particles that are very much more important and then go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about the euro of a little bit , or something like that , and that &apos;s what the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically a little bit of the way that it &apos;s done .
and this is the moment that it &apos;s the core of the scene , and that availability of technology to increase and the information and the information and the most powerful , that more people can get involved there .
because , as the beginning , it &apos;s a very important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it , and also not a chance to make it really well .
because if you &apos;re just reading about it , it &apos;s not the same thing , as if you &apos;ve done it , or you &apos;ve seen it .
and i think technology is always more important in our modern societies .
and if you can make more useful citizens in society , and you can make a difference , and you can do it , you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you also have to do it and understand it to make it and understand it .
and then the most open thing , and the most open science , and citizen science .
so , you know , as citizens in the situation , it &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do this scientific technology .
and that &apos;s the core core of the world &apos;s core .
these are the people who have been officially diagnosed with the website at least , and they &apos;re on the website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and interesting is also that they &apos;re also in southeast asia .
this is me , that &apos;s there , there are fewer people , as actually , in fact .
so i know from some who don &apos;t have a little bit of it .
and that &apos;s just the wounded people , the individual people .
and in part of these things , these places are put together there .
and that &apos;s very much in the beginning .
like said , &quot; it &apos;s just starting . &quot;
and so , the most powerful , the most powerful , because the most popular thing in berlin was the first one , the first one .
and this is a gigantic network of very good , yes , and it &apos;s become a very good network everywhere in the world .
and we hope we &apos;re going to keep a similar thing to do , and then we &apos;re also very much connected to the same , so that it &apos;s also more than that , and that &apos;s what people can be involved in .
and i would invite everybody to deal with it and even try to deal with what .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity , and it &apos;s not impossible to stick enough energy , you &apos;ll get there too far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hello .
how do we work in people ?
this is a question that &apos;s very moving to me as a designer , but also in the field of the field of the world , and all of the things in the field of user .
there &apos;s about how to see people in interactive media so they can use this interactive media and create it a very much more powerful experience .
i think that the interactive media in us are in our own , cognitive models , so paradigm , that &apos;s been in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we can actually create the very interactive media .
and this is very amazing because you actually believe that these are the most important ones that you &apos;ve been doing , that the one is actually bringing up in the future , but actually it &apos;s that the future is exactly in us , in our own roots
what are actually the kind of models of models ?
i &apos;ve been writing four of the people who would be writing and i want to explain to you briefly .
and to get cognitive models and that &apos;s the models that we have in the most recent times .
to these kinds of models , we heard that we have a principle of natural relationship to virtuality .
that &apos;s basically unusual .
i &apos;m going to take it back to the same , and i &apos;ll show you that you have a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second aspect is that since this kind of thing , we &apos;ve been able to be able to talk to this kind of kind of models , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
and the third area , which is actually explaining itself .
we all know that the interactive media is a definition of definition , which includes the denial of the norm , and what of course tells us that we feel the kind of a normal feeling today .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of the world &apos;s office .
so , as it is with the virtuality , that &apos;s actually the most basic thing in the world .
i want to show you that .
how many doors have the house that you live in ?
and that &apos;s not what we &apos;re going to answer to you immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen and happen right now .
they go through the spirit of this house , in the field of the house , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they &apos;re the reality and it &apos;s very much without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and we &apos;re going to give us trouble for example , for example , the virtual reality in our own world , we can actually do this all the time .
and this wealth that the virtual reality is to be able to do the reality of the reality , which has needed people in the most popular times , because they had nothing .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any more .
they didn &apos;t have mass media .
the only thing that had had was her head .
and in this head , memory was going to be .
in this head , it was a little bit of a time , and using this virtual images , the imagination , was also passed out .
and so it &apos;s also so strong in us that we can deal with the virtuality of the 1940s .
the interesting thing about this is when i can do a little trip .
yes , that &apos;s going .
the interesting thing about this is that the human being at the same time , and medium itself was .
now , if you &apos;re going to think about a piece of stuff .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i &apos;m going to talk to you about the same .
the key tool of the world &apos;s brain has been known since the stories .
and the priests , priests , so-called , was a lot of the way to preserve the knowledge of the knowledge of the stories .
and today we &apos;re still very , very strong at stories .
the author of the book of the book , jonathan , and we still have a year of the day of the stories , and we still have a year of stories in the world .
this means for a child that &apos;s going to be able to get the most of the time of the world &apos;s most time of the world &apos;s time of the stories of stories .
now we think our love is to be on stories that we &apos;ve sat on the lap of our parents .
no , no , very , very , very .
this is a lot further back , in the cultures of the world &apos;s population .
but for me , in the field of interactive media as especially amazing , we have a lot of the time that we have a se in our biological memory , the ability to think of the ability .
i brought them an example of the north american tribe of the u.s. bank .
and the life lived in the world &apos;s office of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very reactive area , and you had to navigate it somehow , from island to iceland .
and that &apos;s what we did with this so-called called the so-called &quot;
you may know , if you &apos;re going to be a little bit interested in the australian american american .
they have similar principles .
they have no more sophisticated , but they have used the same thing that &apos;s used , or also , the same thing .
and what the interesting thing about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be photographed by songs .
and the language of the language was the ones that were in the world .
that means you &apos;re going to be on sound and rhythm .
and these sounds and these rhythm have the geology that have shown the topography of a region and that &apos;s what it has , of course , that you could get these songs and put it in the left , and then go back to the left , and
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to come from a after b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
it &apos;s that that &apos;s what &apos;s happening in the process of machine machine .
we &apos;ve moved to this in the so-called so-called the so-called &quot; we &apos;ve been doing this . &quot;
it &apos;s the machine machine , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s the book , and it &apos;s the book .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens , that we have the responsibility for our memories and the own production of our individual memories on external media .
on the book , and on the picture .
so unfortunately , we have a piece of god to be a piece of a little bit more nuanced .
virtuality is all alien for us , and it has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a well-known design of the world &apos;s favorite , is so far to say that this mass media , he means the book and the image , so not television , the internet , and so on , what we call the mass media today ,
let &apos;s make a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
the computer machine for the machine machine .
what has the impact on our thinking and on our memory system ?
then the most powerful thing is the most popular of the world &apos;s population .
and they &apos;re more and more of the centuries of centuries , and more of the time of the brain &apos;s impact is more and more .
and that means , instead of remember , we have a lot of common , far common , in mass , in mass of memories that we can depend on our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more itself .
we have an abstract language .
we don &apos;t imagine the thing that we don &apos;t do anymore in images , but we &apos;re going to do it in the images of our language .
we &apos;ve used to be used to that things that are linear .
and we have the norm as a law , and there &apos;s only exceptions , like the most powerful .
what &apos;s remained is the most important thing .
still , we &apos;re very , very , very subtle , very much arrested .
the question is , what is going on ?
we had the most popular thing , we had the machine machine , and we &apos;re going to go to the machine , and we &apos;re going to go to this so-called called the so-called &quot; s . &quot;
it sounds very much , and it sounds very much about science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of the most powerful , which brings us to the ability to discover our ability back to our ability .
there &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about the most powerful , it &apos;s about the most powerful .
i want to explain a little bit about this .
there &apos;s technical concepts like the augmented reality , which means the extended reality .
so if you look at google , for example , so a concept , which is what we &apos;re doing with the virtual world with the real world , which is called our lexicon to the most normal , natural than a normal , natural , natural , natural
another example is that the virtual reality is called virtual reality .
so , of course , this is what &apos;s crazy in my talk , because we &apos;re moving physically in the existing , virtual worlds , very , very , very much of the model of the brain .
and other examples are the most powerful , smart systems .
these are spaces that are going to respond to a human being .
all that needs the ability to accept our basic ability , virtuality as a real habitat .
i &apos;ve been in the conclusion and i hope that the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the most powerful of michael &apos;s , and the most powerful , and the most powerful , and the most powerful thing .
and the two of these are also here today .
maybe you can get up to the end of the way you can talk to the two about the project .
and this project , i brought to the example of how again , as a , to put cognitive models , to be able to translate cognitive models .
all the way is a game , i have to say .
what the most important thing about , of course , is extremely powerful and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i say computer games , they probably have a very likely eyes , that any people have a lot of people in front of some of the people who are going to play a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a sudden
and anyway , they &apos;re doing that in this .
this is a game outside .
and that &apos;s a very careful thing that i think i discover the outside world , so i discover the real world again .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data that we produce , the real world we produce with the real world .
i apologize that i have to animate so much .
you can explain that much better , because there &apos;s more more behind it .
and that &apos;s about that i discover a city by looking at what &apos;s positive or negative .
and so i get a very different view of the city , a very different impression , which i see negative and positive zones of a city and it &apos;s going to be a whole different virtual map of a city , virtual map of a very real city
and we can now look at this now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another explanation of what you see right .
of course , this virtual world in the walls are in the walls of our cities , yes .
and with a kind of flashlight , we can make this virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize my talk , and that &apos;s what the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the most powerful , and the skills that we &apos;ve been able to have from the world &apos;s brain is that the most important thing
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be able to be in you .
i &apos;ve been asked to be a little bit of a bag of this bag , and i &apos;m going to talk about it instead of the bag .
it &apos;s not going to do it .
i &apos;m also going to escape what &apos;s inside there .
but i &apos;m just doing it , and i &apos;m going to do a little bit more curious .
yes , kids are curious from nature or should be curious , designers also .
i &apos;m an ecologist from house , so i &apos;m also doing the issue of curiosity and how it changes the curiosity , and why we might lose curiosity and how we &apos;re going to be able to get it to the way that we have to do it
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re doing next to the actual existence as a creator .
if professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to be in the n of n .
and that &apos;s what i had last half year .
a computer model for natural users interface .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself why the whole creator of the natural , the natural , the communication of communication , interaction , and so on .
and i just think of one of these little devices , because things are always intuitive , always natural , and there &apos;s going to be , you know , what &apos;s actually for us , and you have to look at what &apos;s really about us , of
and before the background , i have natural user interface in the area of natural economies , so the next generation in the way that human computer is doing in the relationship of the human computer , which is the relationship of the human computer , as the computer
so i &apos;m busy busy when it &apos;s what of course or intuitive .
maybe again , you have to look at it again .
why does this happen at all ?
so if we look at the development of our society , here we &apos;re looking at the third of the third , and we &apos;re going to move from the third to the fourth of the fourth .
so from modern in the world &apos;s office .
every society is shaped by a computer system .
at the beginning , the language of the language .
that means you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve talked to a common language , you could communicate with each other , and it &apos;s moved into the same cave , or in other areas , cities , or the villages and the city , and it &apos;s made of
but the most powerful thing was the language , something very natural , something very living .
you also had to learn to learn , so no a hint of nature , but we learn it , and we learn to do it .
and then that was the most prolific thing that was going to be the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a computer company , because of course , the living language started to manifest the living language in the form of the script that is what &apos;s called the most powerful and alive , i start and i &apos;m going to go and do it in stone
depending on how i &apos;m going to get a little bit of a coverage and when i &apos;m a very different story , of course , it &apos;s a very different coverage of the story when there &apos;s a living way of being a living .
but then , the script was then moved to this script as a computer designer , and then it got to be a way .
then the next generation we actually live in today is primarily life .
this is just the pressure and print in the script with the egyptian and other .
and then it was just a kind of a kind of a kind of a design , where the jury , and other people said , are you actually very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
and now we come in the next generation and the exciting thing , so a little bit of a hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this particular phase , that we &apos;re actually in this kind of kind of time , that we &apos;re going to get
and of course , the confused us is completely , because we see the new media , the social media , facebook , facebook , and so on .
with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what &apos;s the old thinking , don &apos;t tell you that in the most popular , and no beef , or no beef , is that i want to just do it , and i want to just
and these two worlds just go together , new and old thinking .
so , the exciting thing about that is when you look at this new society , these kinds of things , the very many mechanisms , the principles of a lot of mechanisms , principles and the paradigm of the world .
but not more on local level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the theme of ecology is a global .
not if i think there &apos;s local green and the neighbor thinks less green , it doesn &apos;t work .
this is what &apos;s going on from local village , actually , a global village , and of course , , of course , intuitive , but also the total transparency .
so as you knew at the village , who has what &apos;s been about who and when , this is what happens today , this is what we &apos;re doing today about this system of our self .
it &apos;s that we know global interfaces and faster and more and more and more .
so , as it was used to the village , it was happening .
so before the background , i &apos;m just busy looking at what &apos;s called what &apos;s going on for us , which is , of course , what &apos;s going on for us , what &apos;s going on for us , but what &apos;s the difference of what makes
because often people are going to get them , they can &apos;t make it a lot of time to deal with it .
so you have to engage with what &apos;s called , because it &apos;s not just changing it , it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s going to be better .
and when is something intuitive , and how can i take a creator to make it influence and just make things like that , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing , so they &apos;re a kind of intuitive , so they &apos;re fun , and they &apos;re just
you &apos;re going to be busy , as the theme of perception and the most powerful .
and that &apos;s what of course , which is where you start and look and says , okay , now i just look at the inside itself .
and how does it actually look in this ?
so how do we work when we &apos;re going to get there ?
and what does it mean , of course , intuitive and how do our channels work in perception and how does the cognitive processing process work ?
because steve jobs said , you know , you &apos;re going to get to dig up to dig up to dig up to the water of the way that steve jobs are going to be .
so you really have to look at the details when i want to make something more intuitive or intuitive , which is what it means in the core .
and there &apos;s already you see a our seven senses that most of you are thinking about , now , it &apos;s just seven , because it &apos;s actually seven accepted , because it &apos;s still the next to the next , eighth sense of the next , eighth
and look at how we process information , how do we take information ?
and to say , what is information ?
information is any difference that is a difference .
many use the word , but not what it means , but it &apos;s not what it is .
but i have to understand in the core , in the creature , when information is going to be information , when it &apos;s going to be made of data and information , so i know how to do things like that , and of course , i can
and of course , how design is going to influence the perception .
we see this , if i create things , then i can make them confusing as the right , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can make it kind of intuitive by showing things .
so very much natural , in a pub , but i look at it directly where salt and pepper in it .
and if i tell someone , give me salt or pepper , then he will think of the right , where is what &apos;s inside .
and at the left , just intuitive and then hopefully , that no sugar is in it , the salt is just going to give you the salt .
but also our perception itself , as it is , is also how it &apos;s .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the little , although it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just the same size , and yet our perception , depending on what context we do .
anybody know what that is ?
come on .
and the most important thing is , it should work .
there &apos;s a more likely to get to my glasses .
so it &apos;s n circle .
a second circle starts to be able to be able to do certain resemblance or associate .
and then if i &apos;m going to stop a little bit more , we &apos;re not going to see a unit of the way that we &apos;re not just a unit , which is circle , circle and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see
so , you call it a little bit of a time , or you &apos;re just going to be able to be able to be influenced by perception .
so , for the creator , that &apos;s most important in the first semester , the great most amazing .
and the nearby of the continuity of the continuity , the continuity of the continuity and so on .
and then , in the third then , again , forget .
but this is an essential important component , if you want to make things like that , and it &apos;s also intuitive to the way that you &apos;re doing things like that .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting , is the view of this .
so , first of all , it sounds very appealing , but it &apos;s exciting to be more exciting when you &apos;re busy busy .
so we have the eyes , and now you think we &apos;re looking at the front of the front .
that &apos;s wrong .
you see , you see from the back .
and it &apos;s a assumption to the front of the time that you see something you see , the circle of the circle .
that means we &apos;re just seeing our see , before we see it , again , back back to the back of our brain , to say , okay , okay , okay .
i &apos;ve got a cognitive design system , you have what you want to see .
and that &apos;s then where it comes back again .
then again , again , because the back of the back is not the back of the front , and it &apos;s going to say , well , you &apos;re really going to look at it , and you &apos;re sure , you know , what you &apos;re seeing
and then again , again , it &apos;s going to be the back and then it &apos;s going to be just seen .
so a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very much of the way that we
i don &apos;t know who knows that picture .
and this is exactly what i &apos;ve described , which i &apos;ve described .
now , everybody from this pattern is trying to recognize something .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s going to recognize what .
does anybody see something special ?
a computer company , right .
if i saw that , that &apos;s a computer company in there , then you know that .
they &apos;re never going to forget more because i &apos;m going to show you where the most powerful thing is .
now you see the most powerful .
and on , you &apos;re going to see it always .
that means i actually have a little bit of a time of being hacked , that they don &apos;t recognize any patterns , but i have it in a very short time , and again , again , this dog in this limbic picture .
and this is the projection of view , and it &apos;s a look at the way that we see .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m going to see that i see the most popular .
i see the most powerful .
so , very exciting processes that then , in this , , gray is not actually , but here in this particular mass , it &apos;s just going to happen to this .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yeah .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as designers .
if i know something , three seconds , until i &apos;m kind of in the present , i can also bridge very well , and i can also bridge it very well in which i &apos;m going to be doing it by three seconds .
it &apos;s just going to process it as a present .
then it goes into the past and so i can bridge very elegant for example , and i can bridge this phenomenon .
what does the milliseconds take milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time you love in love .
that means , you know , if you know that , you &apos;re looking at who you look at how long you &apos;re looking at , because i don &apos;t get a gun for what can happen .
and 16 milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time of most perceptions that we have .
that &apos;s what happens to this first impression in a rapidly fast speed , as we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at and how we &apos;re also looking at our environment , so we can think about it .
of course , the creator of the minds are not just with the subject of perceptions and neural , but primarily , of course , with the subject of the world &apos;s subject .
so , like a human being , it &apos;s about certain things .
there &apos;s a little bit of the practical functions that are the practical functions , so that &apos;s what the things that are like , or the things that are more important .
there are a lot of things that i know where i really know where to reach .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why are someone for such a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the time where no matter what &apos;s going on , so that it &apos;s not so practical , so that it &apos;s not so practical
there we are more on the symbolic , on the top of the world , which we &apos;re also concerned with as a creator of course .
back to my actual topic of natural user , and the subject , which is also the most important thing , is the most powerful thing .
and the way that i can do it is , as i can do , i &apos;m going to get a certain goal or how can a user be in a certain way , efficient and the kind of a goal .
so it &apos;s more the norm that &apos;s going on .
how can i do something like that ?
i can use this right or i need to be the n of the n , or i need to be a training of training .
and less , or more , it &apos;s a lot of the time .
that i &apos;m just doing that differently and make beautiful , not that it &apos;s better to be more powerful .
you have to understand that .
and if you &apos;re part of the software that we &apos;ve seen , you can see , you can understand why 99 percent of our software is little intuitive , or not to be able to be useful , and not to be able to be able to be
and it &apos;s intuitive to be a fundamental , a fundamental design system , and it &apos;s been a fundamental , and i &apos;ve been able to get a fundamental thing to do , when i want to do technological devices in the people .
why ?
because in the rule we &apos;re using this new kind of the world &apos;s kind of the world , the natural user , for example , are five times faster in the average of our goal .
you have to imagine that if you make something the classic , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software only one hour .
it doesn &apos;t mean that you can probably go home four hours , but you can get your employer or you &apos;ll get a , and you &apos;ll get it to the four hours of it .
but i want to say that it &apos;s a very sophisticated thing for us to make a lot of things .
so if we go back into the field of software , this is the first kind of basic line of interfaces that were very abstract , where you needed months to deal with these systems .
then the next , the next , the most powerful model , or mental model , are saying , &quot; well , you have a picture of something that &apos;s going to be the metaphor , &quot; which is the metaphor of a desktop , to make the metaphor
so not anymore , and they &apos;re not a metaphor or the code of code , but just a metaphor .
this was a lot of the whole thing that did , but it &apos;s also much better .
the next generation of the graphic is really much more with behavior .
so i &apos;m going to create a lot more more often than a creator that looks like this .
this is also a paradigm paradigm .
that i &apos;m going to look at that , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m looking for for success , just the most powerful one .
and when i &apos;m going to step up in these natural users , where i &apos;m going to be a voice , by language , by touch , by a nuclear , by gesture , and not more of the mouse and the cursor , i &apos;m still more
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do again , when the things are going to be more intuitive , when are things really intuitive ?
if you &apos;re intuitive and then i have to get my little friend here , and you see what does that mean , what does this mean from the most important , when is it really intuitive ?
and that &apos;s for us , and it &apos;s always intuitive to us when i have to think about it .
so , he doesn &apos;t like to think , but it &apos;s just going to be a way to do it .
the less i think about it , the intuitive is it .
and what does this mean for designers ?
that means if we look at existing energy , we can transmit existing energy of a little bit of another , for example , the metaphor , then i can do that as a creator .
that means i can just transmit a intuitive , human health system on a software and make the software much more powerful .
and of course , the question is , what &apos;s actually the most important thing about us , and now i &apos;ve been telling you about it .
this is called the so-called &quot; the so-called &quot;
and that &apos;s what everybody &apos;s using , and it &apos;s a acronym , and it &apos;s a acronym , and it &apos;s a acronym , and it &apos;s a kind of a fool , and it &apos;s a very intimidating , and it &apos;s a kind of a
it &apos;s all the time of all of you , but it &apos;s unconscious , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive or partly intuitively .
the model is already going to be a lot of the womb in the womb , and it &apos;s a lot of the world &apos;s world , and it &apos;s going to work in the world in young and old , and it &apos;s used by us all the
and the most important thing about it is about 50 to the most important time of us ever after activity , so in sleep , you found that it &apos;s less often going to be less often than a day .
now , i can just put this mental system , and i &apos;m going to put it in a little bit of a time , and i &apos;m going to put it on a computer system .
and by the way of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the world &apos;s metaphor , but not more a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a computer &apos;s book , a computer &apos;s book .
and this is on a higher grail of the most prolific metaphor than the transmission of classical metaphor , which is the most salient .
and if i &apos;m going to get this , for example , in which i &apos;m going to be able to get a way of a way of looking at the way i &apos;m going to be able to get a little bit of a time , i can
then i can transmit the whole .
i &apos;m trying to do this by a example .
and it &apos;s all been eaten .
and now , in fact , i &apos;m interacting with the object , and i can zoom back to the object , zoom back .
i &apos;m going to get the whole point of view , now , and can say , just to give me all the thing with chocolate for example .
and once a interface , what &apos;s more intuitive and very much natural .
because , i can reach the things like the pieces of the pieces , and they can come to me , and they &apos;re much natural than if they &apos;re in the process of the world , and they can make a lot of the other mechanisms of the
imagination is more more sophisticated , and with this sentence , i want to close to this sentence , and i want to close to the evidence , and a designer , also , to be different , to get a different way to get to new solutions ,
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first one , when you &apos;re going to be a kid , as a baby , is that you &apos;re going to take care of what &apos;s going on , right ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed them to play more or less in the
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t make it learning .
so all of these are all that are here and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m now about this , basically , that whole whole kind of whole , more powerful , 40 years of doing it , in quality of power .
and there &apos;s a central point of this .
and it depends on phosphorus .
give a chance to give you a chance .
every day they give them a little bit of magnitude of phosphorus , and they have to take a little bit of phosphorus , and they have to take two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only glide as a continuous of the world &apos;s brain .
if we didn &apos;t take phosphorus and give it to the way .
amazingly , it &apos;s that we &apos;re here with something that &apos;s actually been a little bit more like , but not that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
because all of the time about energy , but nobody talks about the most important thing .
the most important thing is much critical .
we depend on two countries .
we just have a few years of phosphorus and now now through the world &apos;s world , much more uranium in the environment than in all nuclear panels .
alone in the last 20 years , the tons of uranium are in the last 20 years , in germany .
and we take it all .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment when we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , the environment , go less car .
the environment , make less waste .
the environment , the environment , less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
this is like if i would say , &quot; you know , your child , you just get three times more than five times .
this is just a little less destruction .
if we think about the counter to the most prolific , we will be able to do our whole earth , or later a cemetery .
so , by the massacre , to think of the counter .
and the most important thing about this is to look at the ground as first .
in the ground , over 60 percent of the world &apos;s population is stored .
now , in the moment , corn is building corn and lose between 11 and 30 pounds per hectare , or also the square meter .
that means we lose about five times more than new than new .
we can see the most important thing to see .
and everything is packaging or content .
for example , in the most violent 20 percent of the world &apos;s most prolific , the most prolific 20 percent of the world &apos;s population is now .
and because we become older , the cuban ones will be bigger .
this is kind of all in the most sophisticated .
yes ?
one baby needs about six year-olds .
we could reduce that , of course , 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is being balanced in china in a second .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go with these leaks ?
here &apos;s one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is being emitted in the pigs about the solid components of the city .
in the people over the urine .
yes .
so , you can &apos;t be a pigs .
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s done , right ?
traditionally , we think in the world &apos;s office , we &apos;re too many on the world .
and if you &apos;re the people who are going to be able to get the people out of it , if you say that , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re going to be able to get a lot
and so someone like al gore says one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more important than the human population .
in israel , you say , if you &apos;re a living life , you &apos;re going to be the earth .
here it says , the more you &apos;re going to be more , the better .
yes .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh about four more than we are people .
i could take termites , but in the united states nobody likes termites , in such far , even though they &apos;re a vegetarian .
that means the ants weigh much more than we .
and because they &apos;re physically working much harder than we &apos;re and because they live only three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in the energy consumption , something 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you see how far we &apos;re going to do , what we really wanted to do and how sad we are , we &apos;re at all on earth , you can see that for example , it &apos;s a program , to be a program , and
you can only be a little bit of a time , if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you seen a tree tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to wake up as a trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is a tree .
luckily , yes ?
there &apos;s no a lot of trees on trees .
there &apos;s still six billion trees alone in the water .
so , you &apos;ve heard about the trees of trees ?
that means all our intelligence means that we want to wake up as a trees .
and where you see , even in something like the divine , the most prolific biological , agriculture , allows us to go back to our own own .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that have to go back in the cycles .
and we &apos;re too many .
alone .
that &apos;s what we feel guilty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no more powerful , no more , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , a lot of the people who allow us to go back to our
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , which is oil oil .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it comes to the environment , the highest , not to be there , right ?
so , yes , yes ?
you can only have a little bit of a time when you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot yourself now , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can go back our nutrients .
we &apos;re doing agriculture in brazil where we go back nutrients .
and we can do it right now in agriculture , and we can do nutrients in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china for example , where we take the waste of it .
in china , one of the most powerful things is a more powerful today , and , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid , our nutrients .
that means the whole western , the whole western , is that the city has always taken , but the farmers never have something back .
so , the cities had to grow more , because the farmers were going to go and get the cities to the cities , and they had to get their nutrients away .
so all western rich rich are always expanding until they don &apos;t have the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re a lot of them .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done a lot of the civilization of the year of five years because you &apos;ve always been able to get nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat in china , you &apos;re expecting to be the food that you &apos;re going to be looking for the toilet .
because it &apos;s a vegetarian , and the nutrients take the nutrients .
you have it to eat them for food , not to the most responsible .
that means you can see the internet , how you can go back nutrients .
that &apos;s really beautiful , if you do that , so agriculture makes it , and it &apos;s made in a hectare of land with five thousand people in favelas , and the plant is going to be a farmer , and the facility , and the plant and
and the great thing about this is that the most important thing in the favelas around 90 percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people , and they &apos;re very little bad .
we can support them , good .
this is of course , of course , but the plants carry themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by designing the design that you can just operate .
that means that the most important thing is going back .
and no of these facilities , we &apos;ve been built over the last 20 years , not from these facilities , never ever got the most sophisticated .
they could just just be a liter of a liter of light and then the plant would be ruined over years .
don &apos;t find .
that means we don &apos;t need to control people , very little bad .
we can support them , good .
that means we need to get phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you &apos;re going to be able to do the best of all the treatment of all the treatment of the treatment of all the treatment of treatment .
unfortunately , not in the world &apos;s office , but maybe you can help the most powerful thing to do .
because the most important plant could be the best the phosphorus .
and the one needs to go back .
we see that phosphorus really is critical .
and we see that it &apos;s really possible .
we &apos;ve been using the three years now .
the dutch government explains it , you &apos;ll be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need this all the time .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s world .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of plastic of the world .
these are the countries that control 40 percent of the world &apos;s population .
and the oil is going to replace us through other energy fuel .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace you .
so it &apos;s not about making the existing one less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s particularly to ask what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , you understand that easier because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if you &apos;re sad for example , if you have a little sad , if you have it , and you get 50 of them .
very inefficient .
but all of it , yes , yes ?
or take a permanent one .
a woman in germany eats about six pounds of the time of their life .
it &apos;s .
this is not exactly correct , because because we don &apos;t know how much more powerful is going to be .
but a standard , even at that lighting , can i tell you , is completely inefficient , but all of it , right ?
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
it &apos;s not efficiency , it &apos;s efficiency .
questions about what &apos;s the right ?
not to burn the most powerful , and it &apos;s a little bit better to lose and lose it in the world &apos;s office , but first to ask , how do you get the cycles ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i go to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with a little bit of water and a glass of water .
wonderful , &quot; do you ?
this is efficient .
everything in life is beautiful , isn &apos;t efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything in life is not about saving it , to avoid , to reduce .
all the things .
we say people , oh , you don &apos;t have green in the south .
no , it &apos;s just the right thing , yes ?
in every place where you &apos;re going to be a lot of time , you &apos;re going to get back to the other .
but the wrong things .
if you &apos;re the wrong things , you have a more powerful thing .
as we think of north .
there &apos;s any footprint there .
if you walk , yes , everybody &apos;s footprint .
because the ground is going to die , and the wind and the water is washing away the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , everyone means the footprint that the water remains longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that will be a questionnaire .
not the way .
we say in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask them how to do it , what &apos;s going on with their wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; yes , ?
this is just the minimum .
so not saving , get rid of it .
every waste is essential .
and it &apos;s a lust when you see in italy , like people in the high bow , and the people in the high bow is going to take out of the car .
because you know , this is a kind of a design process .
it &apos;s a form of the form of the world , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
we &apos;ve developed a design of a computer company that &apos;s in temperature room , and we &apos;ve been doing a liquid .
you can throw it out , where you go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re building all over .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they &apos;re going to make the sound of the biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so it &apos;s two cycles .
not all of course is going to be going to be .
a television or a washing machine , which is just using them , they don &apos;t use them .
just the things that the most powerful , like the way that we have the way that we have the way that they have the way that they have , how do they have to be in biological systems , they have to go to biological systems .
things that are used only is going to go in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the most important thing , right ?
so direct ads , and it &apos;s not for the company of the se , but it &apos;s that they &apos;re going to help this company to make these products successful .
because we don &apos;t do the things that we do .
yes ?
so , if i &apos;m going to eat them , and i say that &apos;s free from the most of the time , and then it &apos;s not going to help you .
no , we &apos;re stuck in what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like the way that we do .
not toxic in it .
but everything is in that , is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can put on the top of the world &apos;s brain , and you can go to the biological cycles , right ?
everything is the most important thing about it .
and if it &apos;s possible , of course , we can do it for the jargon , for nike , for the most of the textile industry and the entire textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s population that causes the textile industry .
so , you &apos;re helping it with people , ask them to ask them .
hey , the , , you know , are you really serious ?
because they &apos;ve been doing the same way that they have been doing the most sophisticated .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really do it .
so , help me a little bit about this .
but it &apos;s going .
yes .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been shown .
that &apos;s what it goes .
we can now do things so that if you break up , if you break , you can get into biological cycles .
technical cycles are the same .
there &apos;s a direct light system for this .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , that &apos;s made in the cycle .
so , in every store , you can do things .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the shocks ?
if it &apos;s the waste .
all over these are the negotiations of this , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there &apos;s a lot of time on the street , but even in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastics , so it can go in biological systems if we change the most powerful , that they can just go back to the street , and then they can plant with a baby in israel , or in tunisia , in tunisia .
yes ?
and if you take these shocks , you &apos;re taking it out , it &apos;s a little bit of light , and you take the powder to plant trees .
so this is the baby &apos;s baby , and it &apos;s the whole life of life .
so , we don &apos;t need to be a lot of time , we can be a lot of the time .
it &apos;s kind of a kind of a design of a water print .
yeah , kind of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can actually reinvent everything else .
i started a institute .
now , there are many people working on it , and they can all be involved in .
there &apos;s extra one of the people who can get to the world , where everybody can come .
so not saving , get rid of , avoid , reduce , not a more powerful , but intelligent waste .
does it make it curious ?
thank you .
the work of the computer system .
music as language .
in the description of my talk , i wrote that as a computer designer , i &apos;m as a computer designer , so in english , in english , understanding .
and the written of the written notes are a written notes in a very familiar music .
that as a translator , you don &apos;t just have a word for word the text in another language , but also the deeper sense of words and the more complex sense of words , and it has to understand a meaningful translation of the words that has to
and from the german to the english to the english , more knowledge can require , and it can be more , especially if you &apos;re about poetry or anything about poetry .
but it &apos;s very alien for the most powerful , which we do with our own .
as a computer designer , i first have the written notes .
they think that the composer in the notes has all the things that he had imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and they &apos;re very vague .
these notes are about exactly the same or more , like a verbal , as well as a verbal , and also , very clear , description of landscape .
because in this verbal world , the smell of flowers is not to smell the rate of the world &apos;s disease , the degree of the brain &apos;s brain , not to feel the most important thing to do , not feeling .
this is what &apos;s going to have to be the most powerful thing that &apos;s going to be the most powerful thing that &apos;s going on in a different , which is a different , concrete , non-verbal , nonverbals .
now i want to share with you what i else translate to a musical , so , again , in a verbal language .
so basically a translation of translation .
so i &apos;m going to go to the whole , and i &apos;d like to do it in german , because if i have to translate it to english , it would be kind of like to be in the english of translation of translation .
so the music is working for me as much as spoken language .
the main notes have the function of the letters of a script .
so it &apos;s not going to be just to learn to learn grades and to get the buttons on the piano or the right place on a computer floor .
and that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the mind of the letters you can only see when you can do the language .
so you need to be in the process of music at least as long as spoken language .
there &apos;s also a lot of the time that you &apos;re learning to be the most passive , and you can also understand passive or you can talk to the musical native speakers , until the musical native native native native citizens .
the work of the design system starts similar to how the one of the most powerful .
after you first have a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re going to be able to get the origin of the interface .
you &apos;re going to raise information over the piece of the brain .
you read in the letters , and you &apos;re reading notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts of the composers itself .
you studied the works that he had before and after it .
you compare to it .
the motives , to write it .
how and what did he feel ?
how were his circumstances , how the society and politics ?
all of this is interested in me .
you think in this time , by looking at contemporary images , or the literature , you &apos;re reading the contemporary images .
but the time you have a very , very , very , very rich knowledge , you know , the composers you &apos;re going to play , and it falls to a lighter , and it &apos;s going to be easier to feel in it and feel .
the composer is always going to be more to the friend that you live with .
his cause to write the piece is becoming more and more and more to my personal concerns , to play it .
now , the notes of the picture is a very precise record of the message of the composer , but only a framework , i turn this framework to the point of meaning , and meaning to the meaning of it .
i then say to my own words , which could be written between this framework .
i play the way that these notes could have to mean .
now for me , and for the composers , and what you might mean for him today .
every sound , every phrase , gets a sense of a sense because i feel it , because it &apos;s going to come from my own , and it &apos;s going to come from my own .
it has to be in this , and now , i can &apos;t convince my audience to be that my favorite is that my cause is .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience that i &apos;ve been working on , that i &apos;ve been working on the way that we &apos;ve been doing that as long as experience .
as you &apos;ve been able to have a happy new day , although it &apos;s always the same rituals of life , up , breakfast , to work , i &apos;m going to go to the same piece of the same piece .
i &apos;ve become older again , the seasons , and my pulse goes down , and the time is going down when it takes longer to go back to the morning , that sound back back to home .
i &apos;m going to breathe the audience right , and i &apos;m aware of it , or unconscious .
all of this influenced me and all that affects my experience with the composition .
so , very wonderful , if i stand with a computer company on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , more powerful conversation .
you get a new idea in the and it &apos;s going to be the answer to a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting because things that we haven &apos;t been hacked with , and what you can &apos;t do is that we can &apos;t have samples .
it makes great fun to make music , and they have the audience , and then they &apos;ve experienced how the music communicates alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more like this moment .
i can &apos;t play as well as 20 years .
and i &apos;m going to have more life than today , and i &apos;m going to have a lot more of the brain &apos;s brain , and i &apos;m going to have a lot more more sophisticated , emotions and emotions today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some of the most sophisticated things , but it &apos;s new for new populations .
have a nice experiment to do this .
it was on a computer company for a professional teacher , professor , professor , a well-known , a famous , famous , a famous , a famous , long professor of the world &apos;s book in the world &apos;s office .
unfortunately , i was too young , so he was a lot of time , so he was going to study the way i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortune , it &apos;s very early , with 13 years , and i was already to my school school on his school classes .
i was 17 , when i went back to one of his courses , and i played the last one of the four classes from chopin , a computer company .
he asked me what the introduction of this is the introduction of this .
this is a part of a piece of a piece .
and in my favorite , i said , expectation .
and he &apos;s going to be there , and he said , &quot; so , so ?
this has to be the most important thing .
because for me , she means memory .
he was over 60 .
well , with 17 , you have dreams , but no significant memories .
i &apos;m going to play the piece of all the years and it has been turned out to me , although no single grade has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , i &apos;m going to read something new .
one example of a very different area . ideally , the most powerful thing is made .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different time , in the same time , in the light of light .
he &apos;s translated the most popular , as he saw it , like it &apos;s seen in this moment , like it &apos;s going to look at it .
his personal favorite of the world &apos;s personal .
the key interpretation of a piece is this kind of comparable .
now i &apos;m also older than chopin with a few years ago when he wrote the piece .
he &apos;s lived in the years of a few years .
and it &apos;s important to look at the notes , even though i &apos;m going to be able to do it .
to keep the composer , right with the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially if he died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said , you know , you need about the spoken language for spoken language .
often the most important thing is that you &apos;re learning the notes .
you &apos;re basically learning that first of all , before you just talk a word .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument on the instrument .
if all the fingers in time and right like it is in the notes , they come out , and then they get sound out of the way that music is going to sound .
if that &apos;s accurate , the students get the most powerful piece .
about interpretation , hardly speaking in the world &apos;s office .
well , there &apos;s a quick piece of the time , which is a quick piece .
and it &apos;s slow , slowly .
according to and the , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s most of the time .
but also , if you translate this one , it still stays something of technical .
and it &apos;s not always interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something very much about it .
because , to make music on the instrument , the own musical , and you should feel there .
that &apos;s the singing .
a child that doesn &apos;t learn that , because it doesn &apos;t have the parents to do it , it &apos;s not going to be done by itself .
this is like the most important .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music to get it over another way , so about a tool , to sound .
people who never sing , so they never felt immediately with their body , like it &apos;s , to form a sound .
a phrase with his own breath .
the software model is the extension of our body .
our vocal vocal to sing our hands and feet to dance .
so the most powerful thing is the sequel of my fingers .
the tune comes from the most violent and the rhythm from the dance .
the key thing today is not a very distinctive thing today .
you don &apos;t need to make music even if it &apos;s a boring .
not necessary to whistle a more powerful or singing .
every one of your music is going to be edited up when you &apos;re constantly going to get out of music .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t sing ?
so , i &apos;m going to ask you , can &apos;t sing , a , because you believe you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
in both it , it &apos;s not too late to start to figure out whether they can &apos;t , or learning how to do these little muscles that are going to hire the vocal vocal vocal .
that &apos;s what you can train .
or c , because you have it to be able to get them out of it .
so , i wonder , how do we have the most sophisticated , the diagnosis of the world ?
have you got a little bit of a sudden or a more powerful , like you &apos;re beautiful today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music and you want to do it , and you want to do it .
but what i &apos;d like to regret is because music is a beautiful , a beautiful thing .
but maybe you can even get them more more .
well , you see , all of the cases , nobody has to be a more powerful candidate .
but you don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand anything from classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
and i said , &quot; well , you can say , &quot; you don &apos;t like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says , &quot; somebody , i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m taste , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , you don &apos;t get rid of food , just because you can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to get rid of classical music , because you don &apos;t play any instrument .
listen to it , and say if it tastes you or not .
whether the music is to be too sweet or too sweet .
tell what they feel .
and the time you get standards and you want to get some more spices , or taste even fine differences .
why am i going to challenge that now from my audience that it &apos;s also active ?
because the music is a language , and a language is to communicate .
a artwork that you never look at , has no power to work .
the food that was being cooked by a chef or a chef , has to be eaten and not just looked at recipes or recipes .
so please listen to the music , if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice thing .
if in a environment where adults are actively active or at least active music , a child is growing up , and then it &apos;s very easy for a little bit of a time , to ask the color , which is color ?
can you also play them in blue ?
and the child plays , after a red , rather than a red flower , now a blue flower .
and this sounds very different than before .
and then the first beginning of a musical representation of a musical expression .
so the first step to a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today , which was originally a hundred , two years ago , or at front of three years ago ?
now , the instruments have moved .
there was a source of bach as a instrument even not a piano .
it wasn &apos;t invented .
i think the stream would have been excited when he had the verbal possibilities of the modern world &apos;s world .
i can today the most popular , which has been the stream , to sound on the modern wing , which is not a computer company .
and also , from beethoven , you know that he heard more than he was deaf .
today , a modern orchestra in the situation is able to play everything that has been rejected by a orchestra at the time .
so the composers are dependent on us , which is the pieces of the pieces that are going to be new .
so they &apos;re going to be able to get out of what they &apos;ve just imagined in the spirit .
and also , what you would think about today is .
or what i &apos;m going to do today is because what you might have thought about .
thank you .
you know what &apos;s envy ?
were they a very noisy ?
and how did that feel ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a computer &apos;s driving .
when i come to my little , with my little v , and i &apos;m going to go back to this sense , this feeling is on .
i &apos;m going to take something through the head .
i say , &quot; what do you need to do , &quot; so , what do you need to do ?
this is what it loses in the first year half of his value .
and at all , you work much less than i am .
why do i have to afford to do this &quot; n little car ? &quot;
and then immediately , i &apos;ll immediately fall to this .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this awkward feeling is gone .
our organism invented a great way to get such a little bit of the human feelings like envy .
you can also try and do this with words like revenge or a little bit of a little bit .
i want to explain to you with this mechanism today or something that is probably familiar with you .
the mechanism comes from lying .
but think about the lie , as you might have heard you may have heard , if people say nobody &apos;s going to build the intention .
and then rocks , so he &apos;s going to cut the view off .
and you see , in such a lie , you see that the liars itself don &apos;t believe what he says .
it makes a easy check to see that he has a whole different thing in mind .
he &apos;s just making it , and not itself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , that i &apos;m talking about , that they &apos;re aware of themselves .
they need these lie to get a laser , to get a self-deception .
you can easily get less easily , yes , or also to collapse .
they need time .
and this time , a anecdote that you might know .
the spanish painter is going to take picasso once a woman .
and this woman was going to complain that the portrait would not be able to see her .
picasso says , wait only .
it &apos;s always going to be similar .
and in this point , and if you laugh , you realize how important these lie is and how much time you need to experience something , what artists can tell us very well .
because artists have a living relationship to lie .
the artist shares you something with , and especially this lady , what you don &apos;t see when you just look at the mirror .
the artist shares you in a portrait of something that you &apos;re going to be familiar with when you &apos;re going to look at this piece of artwork again .
then this awkward feeling disappears , it could not look like you , and it will always be similar to you .
here you have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to the most powerful of our brain .
and not only in art , in the world &apos;s brain , in the mythology , in the mythology , it &apos;s going back .
you may know this idea of the lady , which looked at every morning in the mirror and asked him who is the most beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a computer company .
behind seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this true question , also , can &apos;t lie , from that true , from that true , is coming out of this true .
but we should just make sure that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a woman somewhere else .
here it is necessary , which is what we understand under the world &apos;s brain , again .
we need this lie that we have to make the deception , without the we can &apos;t live in .
we don &apos;t just have the art in the art , but in the science , it &apos;s such great lying .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s wife &apos;s history .
she heard about this book from charles darwin , the emergence of the species and the staff of people .
that the human being should be able to put up and , yes , it would be a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then they ran her to her husband and she said that it &apos;s not true , which is charles .
the human being is supposed to be able to put out of the monkeys or a common ancestor .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , we need to prevent that people are going to get knowledge of it .
why do we have to prevent that people know about something if it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live with these kinds of things .
because we &apos;re that self-deception , this feeling , to be great , to be a little bit of a kind of such a kind of such a kind of such a kind of such a , from such a little bit of a kind of a kind of
so , we can &apos;t do these things .
we need to prevent that people are going to get knowledge of things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you see , as slowly that mechanism , and how the traces of the traces he leaves , the way that he leaves on something else is to be a little bit more like that in this great picture of ourselves , i want to show you another
a particularly beautiful story , like i mean .
my wife told me it .
she came from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told her about a student .
a student &apos;s student .
you like to be particularly like it , because he &apos;s got a tendency to be a slope .
and she asked him what &apos;s your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire fire .
and because i &apos;m at the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in the things that i &apos;m interested in .
yes , you &apos;re feeling it if you &apos;re fed in this place . there &apos;s something wrong .
i said , &quot; i said , &quot; if a human being in a moral way , the most powerful thing is , we should try to replace it through the most powerful , although it &apos;s going to replace it .
and then you &apos;re going to learn that and then you experience the sentence .
although i &apos;m at the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in the things for the time .
they feel that this is the actual truth behind the project .
so a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a time , which is not for the most important .
the interested of the interest is to be interested in the design of the world .
but there &apos;s no clubs that we can look at , where you learn how to do fire .
there &apos;s only the second second , just the fire fire .
it &apos;s signed up .
and you &apos;re not saying , you don &apos;t say that you &apos;d like to put fire somewhere and you &apos;re happy to be happy when the fire after it &apos;s going to be .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of that , the risks that are only creating , when they put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this is the most important thing that the most important thing that it was about is that it was actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that loud .
here you have this kind of kind of the unconscious and the conscious , which immediately jumps down without that they can do something about it , and things that you know is that they can look very different for them and other people .
so , just like this , they &apos;re just going to be like that , which we &apos;re using in the language of political correct .
we actually know that something else is the case .
but we know if we &apos;re going to say that , the social history is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to do things in a society that should work .
now i want to argue what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
after which logic , these deception , these self-deception , the willingness to be a different reality than that we actually know in the unconscious knowledge that they &apos;re very polite to spread out of the outside .
so , i want to show you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is ahead of what many of you know , and some of you appreciate , very few of them don &apos;t need to do it at all .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is so much intellectual , says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that doesn &apos;t stop stop , physical nature .
and if you have people who are the solid belief that they have a soul or you can also say that they &apos;ve been able to get out of the soul to life , then the same thing that &apos;s about the soul of the brain , they &apos;re
and from that soul , you think that you somehow do in this kind of fish , in this kind of thing , in this particular nature , it &apos;s called the latin of the latin , the most open .
and then , if this is the most important thing about people , it &apos;s filled with dignity with the spirit , with nature , with nature , which can only live , yes with soul .
and then he can just get a little bit of a time .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so you should come from the outside to people .
so we should be able to perceive it as something that should be present to our lives .
and if you have this premise , you understand the logic that we &apos;re experiencing this happiness , through a lie of our world .
because now you can apply a computer system .
you know , you know , you know , you know , from school .
so this is a very reactive , which describes us a logic .
this is the hardest part of the hardest part in my talk .
here you need something logic , but also the willingness to lie .
so , lying that they can just apply this logic wrong .
in this particular , three sentences come .
the first sentence is , it &apos;s not a soul , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if you have right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i &apos;ve been in this very , particularly .
a third sentence that immediately comes out of people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
the saying who doesn &apos;t have soul , that &apos;s dead and can &apos;t claim anything .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s this logic in this , yes , in this particular talk , to the expression .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences that are logical .
i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a speech about reality .
i can say , the most powerful thing is a man .
and if i have right , the most powerful one is a man .
if i don &apos;t have right , the most powerful thing is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but critical , if i have right , it &apos;s just true .
so if you say , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical correctly .
and now our main consciousness is immediately feeling , you can do something .
it &apos;s a third sentence that doesn &apos;t have anything to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s what it does as the opposite of the first sentence , and it &apos;s been accepted .
because actually , we have to prove whether there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that just uses that two sentences are accurate , and a third of the most powerful , which looks like it would have done something to do with that , so we can save our main system .
so , we do that as if it &apos;s actually impossible without being able to live a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue to continue these things on different examples .
in the present , we have a very modern example of the world that &apos;s going to go back to the most common .
and it &apos;s a different philosophical issue , and you have to think of a little bit of a philosophical issue , and you &apos;re holding a little bit of a time of philosophy .
that &apos;s what we do to do that in the world &apos;s office .
there was a scholars who was called the adoption , and after that , the most popular of the jury named the most prolific .
the most prolific of the jury is a continuous , which is from pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
this is a kind of a design system .
and if you put the exact exact right in the middle between two of the things that he &apos;s doing , he &apos;s going to be able to do it .
because he doesn &apos;t know what haystack he should go to .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
so the main thing is that the main thing is .
and the forces with the other way to solve the other thing is to solve each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
just if you get another example , so if you immediately make a haystack bigger , it doesn &apos;t need any reason and anything .
automatically he &apos;s running for the right thought .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in nature , you &apos;re going to be driven by the larger pile that a immediately wear , then you also have the feeling that it has to give you a free will .
and if we &apos;re in the most violent , i remember the most important thing for brain science .
there &apos;s a scholars that means wolf , and it &apos;s sometimes saying , &quot; you know , wolf , &quot; you &apos;re not going to have any free .
now we can make the second sentence , and we can say , if wolf are right , he doesn &apos;t have free free .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can do almost a day in the morning , you find that in this third sentence .
and this is what it looks like , who has no free free , not to be able to get to the actions and claims to responsibility and it &apos;s so much of the way that it &apos;s going to be .
and there you have it again .
and actually , you have to prove to you , if there &apos;s something like free .
but the logic of deception allows us to do that as if the first sentence was wrong , when you have to think of the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just do , if you want to do anything , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , this courage to get to lie .
practice that for example , if you &apos;re going to meet a human being , you can say there &apos;s no more powerful .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for the most german word , which means the prophet .
it &apos;s not going to call you a little bit more politically , and then it &apos;s a little bit more politically .
say , there &apos;s no more sophisticated .
immediately you &apos;ll be able to do this for granted that you can &apos;t prove to this , you know , you can &apos;t prove .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
because while they &apos;re busy , they &apos;re not going to prove that they can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no more powerful , the man &apos;s very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s fooled .
because he led them to a red one that he didn &apos;t even get to themselves .
because actually , this person is not interested in evidence .
it &apos;s just interested in the need to prove themselves to the need to prove that there &apos;s a lot of time .
so , in the way that the shift of the evidence of the oil is you see the brilliance of lying .
and once you have a way of feeling this kind of thing , this kind of thing that &apos;s going to do with other people , they do it because they &apos;re going to be happy , if they don &apos;t remember them in the way they &apos;re not
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;ve been allowed to have a little bit of a time , if i could mention it .
it &apos;s one of the most amazing , and it asked me if i wanted to hold a talk here and my idea of the creation of the world .
i have to say , you &apos;ve got it to be a lot of time , and i was very hard to talk about my idea .
and i may be able to introduce my favorite to you , i &apos;m trying to introduce you .
but it &apos;s of course the sum of the whole , very many ideas .
i probably , you know , are the two nice girls , i probably think of the generation that has been worried for this bad thing , because i &apos;ve been studying engineering , and i &apos;ve been doing engineering in the world , and i &apos;ve been doing
and then i was in the middle of the 1980s , and i was going to be in the &apos; 80s , because i wanted to make renewable energy and that was not in the world .
there was the most popular thing .
the first thing that was all the time that the most important thing was called the most powerful thing was called the most powerful .
the hot today today .
because a good engineer has made a great car or a good engineer .
but this is what the n of n , from the way , from the day , from a hundred watts from the square square , was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy thing .
i &apos;m grateful to the most grateful that he has the word again , because after the most important , you didn &apos;t use the word , because everything was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that in the world &apos;s office .
there was just this , and there was a little bit of a sudden , and one of them was sitting in the most violent , where you thought that evil .
and the place of the world &apos;s office , but it was called wind and solar and solar and solar and the energy , and i started in the middle of the 1980s .
and yes , a lot of what was said today , really touched me because many , many beautiful expressions of the people i &apos;ve lived in .
i worked in the collective work , which was a lot of the time .
we were 20 people .
if one no said , the most powerful thing was , the most powerful thing , i &apos;ve got a very hard one for 10 years , and i &apos;ve been very hard for a lot of time , if i could really have a great deal of my
it &apos;s busy with a very strict .
and that was really very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
and i then have the way to get out of the world , and then we have a professional school , and then i &apos;ve become a writer of the company that &apos;s got together with the most important of the world &apos;s most important of the world .
a computer company , but also , we have the problem of a growing company and we have a little group of a group , and we &apos;ve decided to go back and go back and go back and think of the next topic of the future and that
and i brought you a project that i want to introduce you to now .
and the title of speech was , yes , as you get too hundred percent renewable .
and we just started to ask a relatively kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a story , where could you be able to make a memory today .
on this island , that &apos;s the island of the island on the top .
yes , these are the data .
there &apos;s four thousand people .
and that &apos;s an renewables today of 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
it &apos;s not a technological thing .
if you &apos;re more wind , the system starts to fail .
i also tell the politicians , and i always tell the politicians when they &apos;re in the world .
and then the say , why ?
we &apos;ve already been 20 percent in germany .
but can &apos;t be a problem .
but it &apos;s not true , we have seven percent and our net is physically seen the european .
if we had 20 percent , we had the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was just , i was just paying out the first contacts , the first contacts with the island , but just to calculate .
as big as it would have to be , it &apos;s actually a battery that you have to take a island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and yes , i go back to a slide .
the conventional system looks like this in the world .
by the way , a year of a year is about a hundred inches of electrical performance on the world .
this is the performance of a hundred nuclear power , because it &apos;s particularly fast everywhere .
the world &apos;s most important thing is that it &apos;s going to be a wind , because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s fast .
you &apos;re like this box .
and then it looks like this .
in the run , three of the most important ones are going to be waiting for two .
yeah , this is a little bit down there , the load is just the burden .
we also have a very precise data .
and the main system or the solar system or whatever it is , is a system of a system , or a system , which can only be in small quantities here .
our goal was just to say , okay .
the wind is going to be a little bit of the wind and the wind , sun , the burden that you can map the bigger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the performance in the moment , you have to turn off the shoulders .
that means that in the moment , you need to worry that renewables can take energy in the entire net .
and of course , you can only be managed to be managed to be managed to be done in any kind of way .
that &apos;s not what nobody did in the world .
and that &apos;s the little style , so you can also use your own , a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little
people always ask me what &apos;s going on in the way that they actually have in the field of time ?
it &apos;s already .
but if you want to do several of these kinds of things , and you should build a net , then it will be extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to come to 70 to 90 percent renewable , and then there &apos;s this rest of the rest that last 10 , 20 percent renewable , 20 percent renewable , that will be very , very expensive , and that &apos;s not
this is going to be a fuel fuel that then , hydrogen , methane , methane , you know , or a sh that will be .
you have to go to a more powerful and not just balance and not just balance .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s a normal , a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a car .
how far is you going to get there ?
and then a whole lot of simulations did .
and have wind and sun and the burden of the burden and came to the outcome , a very exciting outcome that you have to take a middle of the conventional system , which is about 50 cents a single one of the world &apos;s population , about 50
that was the first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper as the most sophisticated , when the average of five percent per year goes up .
and then we started to negotiate with the most sophisticated .
what would all be done ?
have investors negotiate with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new design systems .
we were just five people at the time to build a society again .
and again , the representation .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green system is our system .
that our system also has a more powerful , is that we &apos;re still doing 20 percent with a wind , and also a more powerful thing to do with the other things .
and the most popular , the most powerful that the most powerful thing that we have on the island is that we find very great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , which we can actually map the electric story of the island in the scale of the island .
that means we &apos;ve been looking for the largest battery of the world .
here she is .
it &apos;s actually coming from asia , in the case of japan .
and it &apos;s in the &apos; 70s , and it &apos;s in the &apos; 70s , and it &apos;s been developed in the &apos; 70s , and then it was developed in the japanese .
it &apos;s you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
she has a megawatts of performance and can bring six hours for this performance and that &apos;s the battery that we have kind of more powerful .
and then they set up .
we also have one of these most sophisticated in the same size , like it &apos;s there , in the hall to actually be the complete dynamic behavior of this web , so it looks like this , and there &apos;s the most important battery that we &apos;re doing
and here we are doing this all over the world , the most powerful of the wires , to put the most powerful in the net .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we can also do two kilowatts of the web in the web .
here we see this again , we see the wind again , again , the whole one , the individual , individual .
and what we did since the street was the hall , then , until today , the hall was kind of , what &apos;s going on between the individual system in electronics , to develop software , we did .
so we &apos;re not a more sophisticated , but we define ourselves as a company that is only between the subject and the subject , and everything between .
you have to communicate of course to the battery , you have to communicate in the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is that you &apos;re basically going to be in this island today , and it can basically be the most powerful thing that we &apos;re going to get when we want to increase our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion , like , is going back and the moment , and the way that you &apos;re going to go , the way that you &apos;re going to go to the island , we have for example for 30 percent of the world &apos;s , so
then , it &apos;s going to give you a lot of time .
so , a computer system , a lot of the time .
we can start to integrate up to the island , and we can do it , and we can manage it , because it can manage the burden .
that means if you &apos;re in 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can get through n , you can get through the nets , yes , you should do it in every case , and you can never do the percentage of the way you can &apos;t get rid of memory .
and this is the n of the message .
so , many people come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn off the shoulders , you don &apos;t have this spinning mass , which causes a certain inertia in the net .
and our main system is basically a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of power , which is the wave of the power of power , where always the wave around europe is in the world .
we look at this web in this web , and we see 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s going to be nine hertz , we start a few of the things that we &apos;re going to do , and then we &apos;ll get a little bit more of
this is the system .
and of course , this is incredible .
if you get this somewhere , it takes a while .
the most powerful reserves has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in time , you can respond to other other .
if you don &apos;t have that , these spinning mass , then you have to replace this with a little bit of the mass and the more powerful .
and we can put two milliseconds in the two milliseconds .
and then you see , what enormous amounts of energy there are .
and the message is , we need to get rid of these rotating masses when we kind of do our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 percent and so on when we want to reach the all , and if we want to reach
then we have to break our own capacity into the net .
so , it &apos;s just called the power station , which is going to take the frequency .
yes , this is a very , very much a moment of the moment , and we &apos;re not going to do it , because we don &apos;t , or we don &apos;t , or it &apos;s not going to be .
and we just try to say that you can get the capacity to get the capacity to break down , and you can get a little bit of a life to the web .
so , fortunately , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies now .
and that &apos;s what people come to that purpose , and they &apos;re looking at our own , sort of , in the way we &apos;re doing our own , kind of our own .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you get a piece of a bit more future .
and many discussions that i had in the last six years were similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years , to the subject of the last 30 years .
isn &apos;t it , is a lot of the time , and we have all of it , we &apos;re all going to be able to do it .
we have 30 inches of the world &apos;s first time in germany .
this is a lot of the time .
and i just go from that , that we &apos;re going to store the same capacity in the next 30 years , and we &apos;re going to have the same capacity to the world .
just just , it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s a whole lot of the amount of plastic , and arguments .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve been in the last two years now that scientists are going to ask my side .
we have now gotten over 10 million of the world &apos;s most , also , to be a german web now .
this is going to be in april in april .
so , by that , you also realize that there &apos;s a change there and just from that conclusion to the idea , a hundred percent renewable is true .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a computer system .
and so far in discussions , these are always trying to do this , that &apos;s the kind of thing that we have , which is a little bit of a web that has a little bit of the web , which has nothing to do with our own
the question is , but it &apos;s just a very simple thing to do when you &apos;re completely independent from some fossil or a half of the fossil or you &apos;re going to be able to get out of the world , and you &apos;re going to be a
then they &apos;re just using what sun and wind is there , where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a computer supply , and i &apos;m a cradle to cradle to the energy , that they said , solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and we come in , and we &apos;re going to get the talk from the ted of the world , that you can be a collective and solar energy , and it &apos;s a little bit together .
and well , i just want to encourage you to be able to be a little bit crazy , and you can be a vision of a little bit of a vision , and you can have a vision .
and you really have to stay quite tough , but i think it &apos;s going to be .
thank you .
when steve maccready , the one of the los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , a rough , risky , homeless , homeless , who had just two strings .
many of you will know the story because from the paper of the article , later , a book that was going to be a book that was going to be a little bit of a book , with robert &apos;s junior , and jamie , as nathaniel anthony
nathaniel left drunk , suffered a breakdown and 30 years later he lived as homeless on the streets of the street of los angeles in the center of los angeles .
i recommend to read all of you , and look at the film , and look at the film so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connection that &apos;s made between these two men , but also how the music was going to make this connection , and
i met mr. &apos;s in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney hall .
he just had a demo of beethoven &apos;s first and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he talked to a very high and a little bit of the sound of the film , and hillary clinton and hillary clinton and about how the dodgers never would do it in baseball , and that &apos;s all of the time of the first violin in the last
we came to talk to music , and a few days later , i got an email in which nathaniel was interested in me .
i have to mention that nathaniel was a medical treatment , because he was already with electric and with a plastic and the most powerful and a trauma , which has been tracking his whole life .
so , as a result , it &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic stages , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he disappears in the streets of the street , and the streets of his own mind , and the most prolific of his own mind .
and in exactly this one of the most powerful , nathaniel , when we started with our first class in the walt disney hall , he had this crazy thing in his eyes and worked completely lost .
he talked about invisible milliseconds and smoke and how someone wanted to poison somebody in sleep .
i was afraid not , not a lot of time , but i was afraid that i could lose him in a state , and that i could destroy him in his own way , if i started talking about scale and the other exciting forms of the world
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s first sentence .
and while i played , i fell on , in the eyes of a total change , and i was going to go in a complete change .
it was when he was under the impact of a invisible drug , a chemical response , whose play was my game .
and the anger of anger is turned into understanding in a quiet curiosity and grace .
and as a miracle , he took his violin and started playing some clips of the street , and then i asked to play them , and then to play them , and they were going to be able to play , and they were going to be able
we started talking about music , starting from bach about beethoven , fuzzy , and all the other things that the other other people , from the other to the other , from the other to the ground .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just know a very , very much of music , but it also was a close personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i &apos;m going to know about my colleagues in the philharmonic of los angeles .
by playing music , and i talked about music , was from this kind of thing , confused man , who was just moved through the streets of los angeles , a computer company , a great , great , great , in drunk , in drunk , in
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means emotional health .
because the music allows him to be his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in something real .
and so he &apos;s going to be his own .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
this is why we do music : so we &apos;re doing something that is in all of us , deep in the inner , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of this expression is all the way , and it &apos;s going to move and we &apos;re inspired by the rest of us .
what nathaniel set up , so it brought the music back into a community of friends .
the power of music brought him back into a family of musicians who realized his talent , and he realized it .
and i &apos;m always going to go back with nathaniel music , whether in the walt disney hall , or in the row of the row , because he reminds me why i was a musician .
thank you .
bruno &apos;s : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i &apos;m stolen to the most powerful .
i hope you forgive me .
so i &apos;ve known many fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first one , that was more like a passionate kind of a passionate thing .
it was a beautiful fish , and it was good , good texture , a computer , a book on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was being fed into the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel that it &apos;s going to be to sell him .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
one day , the boss of the company was called , and asked if i could be a event on the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem has become for our chefs , how do we keep fish on our own lifetime ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been able to get the ocean to the ocean as we were beaten in the forest .
it &apos;s hard to be the destruction of the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the most powerful , the most powerful , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , maybe , or bad , you know , it &apos;s going to be a part of our future .
many arguments about it . the environment , the environment , most of you , and you &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a computer company from 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of the way that you have to get a pound of a pound .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so , finally , a company that was trying to do it is to do it right .
i wanted to supported them .
the day before the event , i called the boss of the pr for the company .
let &apos;s say it .
&quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for that , so far out in the ocean , you &apos;re not going to be able to get the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste of our fish is distributed , not concentrated . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this is the most important of the world &apos;s population , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
and one of the things that we do is to do great .
&quot; the &quot; s to one ? what do you feed ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put it on .
and at that evening , i was in bed , and i thought , what hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , shortly before the event , don &apos;t do .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you know what &apos;s sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he will be asking .
now , i &apos;m going to be a few people in the company . nobody could give me a proper answer to the senior biologist , and i finally got to the senior biologists .
let &apos;s also call him to do it .
&quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; what for example are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some of the things that he said , and then he said , &quot; he said , &quot; he said , &quot; he said , &quot; he said , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; well , &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , skin , junk , dry , dry and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your own life is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , these are about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you know what &apos;s sustainable about fish to fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i &apos;m going to get out of this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a computer company and i &apos;m a little bit of a sudden .
that &apos;s me even .
no , i actually have a lot of the fish , because , i swear to god , the fish after this conversation , and it tasted the fish after that conversation .
this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love story .
it &apos;s romantic species that you know , the better you know your fish , you &apos;re going to love the fish anymore .
i &apos;ve been eating it first in a restaurant in a restaurant .
a journalist was spoken for a long time for a long time .
it &apos;s kind of a kind of a way of being able to do it .
he came up with a bright , almost a white white color .
the chef had him .
wait twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can let a fish so well , after he was going to be a fish ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it a lot of the time . it &apos;s called the ancient .
and no , he didn &apos;t eat the fish and he &apos;s not a chef . at least the way you understand and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at the ted war la .
this is a computer factory in the street corner of spain .
it &apos;s close to the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of the hands .
they grew up on what was basically the wetlands .
they made that by putting the country out .
they built these complicated consequence of channels , and they &apos;re going to be in the river , and they &apos;re out in the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that that worked , not economically .
and green was a disaster .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds to do what many birds are .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company bought the country .
what did you do ?
they have the river of the water .
they literally put the lever .
instead of using the water , they used the channels to get the water back .
they &apos;re going to be the channels .
they created a 11,000 acres of the street -- the most powerful , shrimp , shrimp , shrimp -- and they have a lot of the things that are completely different , and the environmental destruction of the world &apos;s disease .
the farm is incredibly .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
they stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you &apos;re seeing is the channels of the channels and these density , lush march .
i wasn &apos;t a long time ago at the time .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles , and a part of &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were and fought by the wetlands and i was going to get a mud and i have a mud , and i &apos;m going to have mud to my knees , and the more and more , in quiet , a little bit of a
this is a rare thing that &apos;s going on .
now he mentioned the most popular of the moons .
and here he looks at a pattern of concentrated , remembers it to the top of the top .
it turns out that that the most important part of its career has spent in the national national park in africa .
i asked him how to become a kind of a computer system .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and falls in more talk from rare birds and algae and weird .
and you don &apos;t understand me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the community community , so in the way that the way that we do it .
it &apos;s great , but i was love in love .
and my head was weak about this kind of delicious piece of delicious fish that i had on the most of the time .
so i was interrupted . i said , &quot; &quot; soft , how does it come to your fish so well ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the chief , the relationship , that &apos;s incredible .
but what eat your fish ?
how is the most powerful ? &quot;
now , he goes to me to tell you that it &apos;s a rich system that the fish eat , which they would eat in the wild .
the funding of biomass , the suburbs , the zoo , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely a little bit of a sudden .
there &apos;s no food .
the one farm is not going to be the same thing that &apos;s not feeding your animals ?
later , i went to this site with a lot of the time , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems like , &quot; for a place that seems to be like , &quot; how do you do success ? &quot;
in the moment , when a director was a movie director , it would have been a movie director .
and we &apos;ve been doing the corner of the corner and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pinker , a literally , a little bit of the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your own , pink .
they &apos;re going to be . &quot;
and i was completely confused ? i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; &quot; deadly , &quot; you don &apos;t get your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and the birds .
well , last year , on this site , 600,000 birds were 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s the biggest and one of the most important private health systems in europe .
i said , &quot; &quot; deadly , is it a good thing to do , not the last one you want to have on a computer factory ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we build the way we &apos;re building it , not intense .
this is a commercial network .
the most sophisticated food is eating shrimp .
the shrimp eat the drone .
so the pinker of the belly the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that &apos;s their success in their own own .
a computer system , but also a computer system .
oh , and by the way , these are not even there .
they breed in a city 240 miles away where the most powerful is better for the most powerful .
every morning they fly 240 miles to farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles back .
they &apos;re doing that because they can follow the white white line of the highway .
seriously .
i had introduced a way of penguins , so i looked at a lot of the time .
i said , &quot; &quot; deadly , fly , do you fly 240 miles on the farm and fly down at the night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me when i was quoted just a song from whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like a more powerful . i don &apos;t like them . i like it not .
it &apos;s this kind of thing that &apos;s going to be , the taste of taste .
i &apos;m almost never cooking with it .
and yet , when i tried to try and have it in the restaurant in the field of time , she didn &apos;t even tasted to be a little bit of a time .
she liked sweet and in the way you would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned that to the deadly and he &apos;s going to be a lot of the time .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense before something is going to be in the body .
she &apos;s developed in evolution to be able to get out of evolution . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no more powerful . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your fish . a farm that measures her success in success .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a more powerful , he &apos;s a huge , because the water , that &apos;s coming through this farm from the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things to be , from which rivers are going to be in the way that rivers are going to lead to the chemical pollutants , flow of the plastic .
and if it was fought by the system , and this leaves the water , the water is clean , as it &apos;s .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not only a farm that &apos;s not feeding their animals , not just a farm that &apos;s their success in their own health , but a farm that literally is a more powerful , and not only for these fish , but it &apos;s also for you and
because if the water is going to be the water , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that should be , because these love love , like romantic , is also also a result .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good food , whether we talk about the future or a more powerful .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food , actually , really taste .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
we &apos;re not a more sophisticated , we &apos;re a fuck . we &apos;re lover .
we love farmers . we love little little bit of the time . we talk about local food . we eat organic .
and if you say that the things that are going to be good about is somebody who &apos;s going to tell the future of good food , and says , &quot; hey people , i love the world , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;re making enough calories to feed the world more than only to feed .
one billion people are being starving today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of the most prolific inequalities in the distribution , not the greenhouse gas emissions .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because they have the logic of our favorite , the last 50 years .
feed grain of herbivores , the other , chemicals on the earth , the chicken , chicken , and the whole time has just asked the agribusiness , &quot; if we feed more people , how awful can it be ? &quot;
this was the cause . it was the kind of thing that was the business of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a craft in the field of a form , a craft that makes the fast environmental capital that allows you to do that .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our main system today is threatened by the most profitable , not because of the resources , but because of the resources of resources .
not by the latest world and the most prolific , but through fertile land , not by pumps , but through fresh water , not by the water , but through the forests , and not through the ocean , and not by fish , and it &apos;s through
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that allow each community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in it , and it never produces something really good to eat .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is the one that &apos;s in two billion years of expertise .
look at a lot of the time , farmers like a decent .
businesses who are not worlds for themselves , businesses who are collecting the food , they &apos;re going to grow the business , and they &apos;re growing the most powerful , farmers who are not only only survival , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships ,
because they are the ones who are experts also .
and if i &apos;m really honest , they &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;m ever going to be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to illustrate one thing today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data we consume is bigger than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking about the amount of information that we can think about how we can use information as well as
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical of the age of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called the so-called , and what i can do with a certain cause of death , i can filter accidents .
and immediately , i see another pattern that makes it happen .
and that &apos;s because in the most active here , people are active and they &apos;re over here .
we can move further out and then we get the data to the data and see that the world &apos;s usual suspects and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now if we go to age and for age , we say 40 years or younger , we &apos;re going to see that accidents are even the cause of the people who are supposed to worry about people .
and who &apos;s looking at that is that this is particularly true in men .
so you see that this is what the information and data is very much in the way that we &apos;re looking at in a living form of life .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not for content itself ?
now what we &apos;ve been here is the most important of every single sport , &quot; sports &quot; that ever had been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it for my talk in your rooms .
with a decade , you can stick in a decade .
you can stick in a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this copy and the sports .
i &apos;m a memorable armstrong fan , so i click here , and i &apos;m going to show you all the time in the blink of the blink of the that .
now , if i just want to get a little bit of a time , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the subject ? &quot;
so i go back to a step and i &apos;m going to go back to the perspective .
now i see greg &apos;s .
and so you get an idea that if you hit this kind of information , more specifically , wider , zoom , you don &apos;t look at it or just not just .
you do something that is actually a little different .
it &apos;s something between and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to do this idea of something that is a little bit crazy to about what a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single one of the things , and it reduces a little summary .
the summary contains a short view of the field that comes from the area that comes from it .
i just show the top 500 of the most popular .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
and immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are on wikipedia at the most popular .
i &apos;m going to choose the subject of government .
now , after i &apos;ve chosen the government , i know that the most important thing that &apos;s going to be at the most time is the time of the time of the year .
this is really important , because this is a realization that is not in a single single way .
that &apos;s just to recognize if you go back to a step and look at the whole .
so , in a certain of these summaries , i can go in the subject of time magazine , &quot; people of the year &quot; in the year , and all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i know that the majority of it are the majority of the world . some of them come from science . some , less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize .
so we can jump and look at all the ted prize winner .
you see , we &apos;re surfing in the net , and it &apos;s really a net , not just from side to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
i just show you the new york times website .
and the application of this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can see websites with it -- and we bring these things to each single website like this .
so i can go back to a step , and jump directly to a specific unit .
so this is important because you just look at the websites from the websites in this kind of way , and the whole way that you can look at the same way of looking at the same way .
so i can zoom in in a particular place in a particular place .
here &apos;s the whole demonstration that i &apos;ve been thinking about here .
and i can kind of see everything i &apos;ve seen today , again .
and , when i go back to a step , i can be able to make my course of my course , and i can be able to be able to be able to take my course for the last , and here i have been looking for a
and from here , i can go into the side and put it back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used again , and every time it makes it bigger than the sum of the world &apos;s sum .
now in this world , we think that data is a priori .
we &apos;re talking about the consumerism of the computer .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of walking from one to another , we start to go from many things to many things , and see patterns that otherwise would be hidden ?
if we can do this , then this previous one is going to be a new source of sense of information .
and , instead of moving just into information , we can get knowledge of it .
and if we know , maybe we can actually pull wisdom out of it .
so i hear , thank you very much .
i grew up with a very high part of science fiction .
in my school school , i went to school , every day a hour per hour .
and my nose always put in a book , a computer company , which my thoughts in other worlds , and in the way my own , is my deep , and i &apos;m going to get curiosity in my own way , and i &apos;m going to get
this curiosity also showed that i was always , when i wasn &apos;t in school , through the forests , and i went to the forests , and &quot; samples , frogs and snakes and beetles and beetles , all after home , and looked at the microscope .
i was totally a very reactive , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and the limits of the possible explore .
and my love to science fiction seemed to be in my environment , because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea .
jacques greene came in our living show with his fascinating shows , which we showed animals and places and a world full of wonder that we could never have imagined before .
and then that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be very good at that time .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there &apos;s no video games that are still going to film the whole imagery with a bunch of imagery in the media landscape , and i had to create the images in my head .
we had to have all of this . if we read a book , we took the description of the author and we put them on the screen in our heads .
my response to this was drawing and paint from aliens , aliens , robots , robots , and all of this .
in math class , i was constantly caught by the teacher , as i was , hidden in the textbook , and i was hidden .
creativity had to be somehow out .
and what happened is something interesting about that , which is what i was fascinated with , which is a thought of jacques , the thought of a whole unknown world here on our earth itself .
i certainly would never get a alien world with a spaceship , and that seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i actually could enter , here on earth , and she was just fascinating and exotic like all i had ever imagined when i had read these books .
so i decided to be 15 , diver .
the only problem that i was living in a small village in canada , one 1,000 miles away from the next ocean .
i didn &apos;t get to get frustrated with it .
i &apos;m going to be my father , until finally , a computer company in buffalo , new york , found exactly on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my favorite in a pool of the middle of the winter in the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got two years later , and i was just going to go to the face of california .
since then , in 40 years , the most powerful , i spent about three hours of water , 500 hours of it in waco . 500 hours of it in waco .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the ocean , is the same way of living in the ocean , as we can really imagine .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know borders , unlike our own , more , more of our imagination .
until today , i feel the deepest awe of what i see on my dives .
and my love to the ocean is holding up with the same intensity as you &apos;ve ever been .
when i was a career , it was a profession , it was the compiler .
this seemed the best way to tell my inner urge to tell stories , to create pictures , to unite images .
as a child , i was constantly drawn books and so .
so movies were the way to bring pictures and stories . that fit together .
of course , the stories i was doing was , from the most popular , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terminator . &quot;
&quot; i could &quot; i could be able to connect my preference to the world &apos;s ocean and the gathering of the banana .
so , basically , my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; the &quot; &quot; to solve a problem in this movie -- and we had to create a kind of liquid design system -- we &apos;ve been able to get a kind of liquid animation , we were going to go back to a vegetarian
what came out of it was the first one of the first , the first one that was ever in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t get a money , and he was just going to be able to do his cost , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience on the world was like the magic of the magic , which went from it .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , the law is not to distinguish the technology and magic .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s going to have to be involved in the most sophisticated . &quot;
so we went in &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; the next film , even more .
together , with a lot of plastic , we created the guy from liquid metal , and the success was very , very , very , very , very , like this effect .
and it worked . again , we &apos;ve created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same . but we &apos;ve been doing a little bit more money .
from those two experiences based on this , a whole new world has reached a whole new world of creativity for the design of the creativity .
so i started a company with my good friend , and i was crying with my good friend , who was the best of the best , and she was called &quot; digital design . &quot;
the idea of this company was , the phase of analog processes with visual printers , and start to start with digital printers .
and we did that , and we did a more quickly advantage of a advantage .
but in the middle of the 1990s , we realized that we were in the most popular and the most important -- what we &apos;ve actually founded , and we &apos;ve actually started to get the company to slow .
i had written this piece &quot; avatar &quot; that was going to be the bar in visual effects and the effects of the effects in the new heights , with a practical human , expressive characters , and the world should be the most powerful . and the world
but the bar was very beautiful , and people in my company said that we didn &apos;t have to be able to do that .
so i turn this and made this other film over the big ship , which is falling .
and i was sold to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but i was actually trying to be in the real train of the titanic .
so i did this film .
this is the truth . the studio knew that , but it didn &apos;t .
but i believe you &apos;ve convinced , &quot; we &apos;re going to go to the train . we &apos;re going to film the real train .
we &apos;re going to show it in the movie of the movie .
this is incredibly important . it &apos;s a good thing for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but that &apos;s where the own imagination can make a reality .
we actually created six months later , and we actually put a reality in a russian , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i looked at the real titanic through a computer company .
this was not a movie , no a movie , that was really .
so , that really blew me up .
and the preparation of that was enormous . we had to build cameras and light lights and everything .
and i fell on how much these things , a very similar thing .
well , they were also more sophisticated and more sophisticated planning .
you go up into these capsule , you &apos;re going down in this dark , hot environment , where no hope is on saving , if you don &apos;t get back to it .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a computer scanner .
this is really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , the part of the way that we have to do with curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that was not allowed to be hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .
in some of the following expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in the world , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that haven &apos;t seen before , and for the science , when we saw them , no words had found .
so that &apos;s really a really important thing to me , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met a little bit unusual .
after the titanic of &quot; titanic &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my favorite card as a filmmaker in hollywood , and i &apos;m going to get a while for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we started to go to the &quot; the &quot; s , &quot; and they explored with the computer .
we went back to the train of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which was a computer company .
our intention was , and the inner thing to look at , and look at the inner of the ship , which was never done before .
nobody had ever explored the inner of the world &apos;s inner , and you didn &apos;t have any tools for that . so we developed technology .
and now i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a computer scanner , and see the bombay that &apos;s pretty similar to this , and that i know that once the band played there .
and i fly with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the ship through the runway .
i actually serve it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically inside the titanic of the titanic .
this was the most popular form of a computer that i ever experienced . because before i put up with a corner , i knew , i always knew what was going on in the vehicle of the vehicle , because i went to the film .
and the set was a very precise copy of the ship .
so that was a very strange experience .
she made me aware of this kind of thing that you use such a little bit of a time of the brain , and that &apos;s how the own consciousness in the vehicle can be embarrassed in the body .
it was really immensely profound .
and maybe a little view of what might happen in some decades if you have a little bit of time to explore something or to do something else , in all kinds of things that i can imagine as a design of a lot of time .
after that expeditions , we started what we saw down there , really appreciate , for example , to learn this kind of thing , where we saw this incredibly amazing animals , and that &apos;s kind of alien , but here on earth .
they live with help .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight of the system , as we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
and i also was interested in the same time , and i was very interested in the same time that was the most important thing from my childhood .
and so i ended up with people who are interested in space and to do with nasa and in the most powerful and the right , and they &apos;re going to go through russia , and they &apos;re going to go through the mission of the mission , and
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was going to be out of that , i took a lot of the deep sea .
i took them to the world , and i was going to get them to the world down there : the most powerful , people who are interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources of these extreme situations , and they could test
we did it , but actually , science , it &apos;s actually going to be , more specifically , and we did it .
so the circle of my existence as a child , as a child , and the use of the reality .
and in the course of discovery , i learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science , but i think you &apos;re certainly thinking , a director has to be able to be a leader , like a leader or something like a computer , or something .
but i didn &apos;t understand much of leadership before i &apos;m going to get this expeditions .
because in a particular point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
these are the most intuitive films that are not going to make us a money .
we &apos;re just playing the cost of the cost . it doesn &apos;t have a trace .
all of you think i &apos;m between the titanic , and &quot; avatar &quot; and i would have a nails on a towel on a towel on the beach .
i &apos;ve all got these films , this kind of thing , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money , what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it about the task to the challenge -- and the ocean is the most powerful environment that there are . you &apos;re doing it in the most powerful because of the strange connection , and because of the strange connection , that comes out of a
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who worked for years , and sometimes we were two to three months in the sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is that the most important thing you have , because you have a task that you can &apos;t explain to any other .
if you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the legal , the most powerful , and the whole technology , the whole technology , and the difficulty , the human performance , if you &apos;re working on the sea , you
there &apos;s a connection , a very vulnerable respect .
so when i came back to turn my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you &apos;re going to be able to get out of your team and it deserves the respect to the respect .
so , this is actually changed the dynamics .
so , i was back to a little team of unknown terrain , and we were in the &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that didn &apos;t have before .
incredibly exciting .
a tremendous challenge .
and we were to a time of four years of four years of a real family .
so , my kind of thing changed to make films completely .
there were people who were saying we had this kind of thing , and we were really doing it , and we were doing it in the planet .
for me , it was more a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a way to do my job , the real process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we close from all of this ?
what lessons we learned ?
i think the first thing is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create reality .
and the conscious of your team is more important than all of the world &apos;s population .
i come to me young filmmaker who say , &quot; give me a advice , like i can do something like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t even do a you .
and that &apos;s what they get to do . don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t listen to yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has a little bit of a time , &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art and exploring , a alternative to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a little bit of a time .
no important endeavor , innovation , was the way that the innovation was being addressed .
you have to be ready to take risks to yourself .
this is the idea i &apos;d like to give you to the way to do . failure is a alternative , fear , but , thank you . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and that may be surprising to something because my favorite of the foundation in the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds to make things that we need to invent and deliver to make the poorest two billion billion .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , actually , even more important than everyone else on the planet .
and the most important thing is that their favorite is not going to grow over many years , and we &apos;re too much rain , and it &apos;s too much rain , and things are going to change how it can &apos;t be able to be able to do
it leads to the way that it leads to uncertainty . it leads to uncertainty .
so , a climate change will be terrible for you .
and also , the most important thing for you is very important .
the fact is , if you could reduce one thing , the cost of the price would be more effective at the most effective .
well , the most important thing is , the time is like that .
in fact , the most powerful thing is the most important thing .
the most powerful thing is the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a fast case in the middle century , and so we have refrigerators , air , we can create modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s take the price down -- we &apos;re going to make a new barrier and this barrier with co2 together .
co2 is turning the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they add the carbon footprint , which leads to the most powerful , and that &apos;s a lot of negative consequences , and the effects of the weather , and perhaps worse , the indirect consequence that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to such a way and collapse
well , the exact relationship between a computer and the net is going to be the net and where their other consequences are , there are some of the things that are there , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to be . but they will be extremely bad !
i asked the most popular several times , &quot; do we really have to go down to zero zero ?
does half the half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we go close zero , the temperature goes further .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a 3.5 foot high truck , which has to have a three feet of bridge , and you can put it under a three feet .
this is what &apos;s going on to the bottom , on zero .
now , we &apos;re going to go a lot of a lot of the time , over 26 billion tons of tons .
every americans are about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons of the planet on the planet .
and somehow we need to create changes that are lower on zero .
it &apos;s been up .
only different economic changes , it &apos;s influenced with all of us , and we have to go from the rise to reduce the increase to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit
so let &apos;s look at each factor of a factor , and we think about how we get this on zero .
probably one of these numbers must come very close to zero .
now this is basic algebra , but we &apos;re going to go through it .
first of all , we have the population .
today , the billion billion people live .
and it &apos;s going to take the nine billion of the people to move on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the most powerful and the most powerful , we might be able to reduce 10 percent to 15 percent , but we see a slope to be 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
that includes all the food we eat , clothing , television , heat .
these are very good things , and it means that these services are almost available to each other on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might probably be able to get a hundred and less use , but in average , this number will rise every year and then double more than double the number of services that will be put in a
here we see a very basic service . there &apos;s light at home , so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their own business .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t rise .
because of different successes in the world , through other kinds of ways , through new methods in the world &apos;s brain , there are many services that are going to be a lot of services , and there are many of the services that are reduced to 90
in other service , how the manufacturing of the design of the world , 65 00 : &apos; 80s : &amp; &#93; -- &amp; : &apos; 80s : &apos; 80s , or the most important or the most powerful or the most powerful or a half of the time
all of the time , if we &apos;re optimistic , maybe we get a reduction to a factor three or maybe a factor six or maybe a factor six .
but at the first three factors , we &apos;re now from 26 billion tons of tons of tons , and that &apos;s just not enough !
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that will be a unit of carbon .
it turns out , if you can get that on zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
almost every single one of the electricity for electricity today is co2 , except renewables and the energy .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need a lot of time .
now , if i use the term &quot; wonders , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and the services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these wonders .
usually there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to a certain date .
usually you &apos;re just going to be wrong and some come , other people don &apos;t .
but in this case , we have to give up the way we have a miracle in very short time .
now , i asked myself how can i really get this ?
there &apos;s a natural representation , a demonstration that &apos;s going to be the idea of people here ?
i remembered the last year when i got mosquitos and somehow liked people .
the idea was really tangible for them , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , this was a one .
i decided that the back of fireflies was my favorite contribution to the environment here .
so here &apos;s a few natural fireflies .
you &apos;ve told me that she doesn &apos;t bite . actually , you don &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of things like this , but they don &apos;t get much .
we need solutions , either one or several people have a unimaginable scaling and unimaginable government , and even though there are many directions where people are looking for , i really see five , which can afford that big demands .
i &apos;ve gone down , and i left fusion , fusion and biofuels .
and maybe this is a very subtle contribution , and if you &apos;re going to afford better than i expect , it would be great , but my punch line here is that we need to work on all these five , and we can &apos;t give them a
let &apos;s first burn the burning fossil fuels , burning from either coal or natural gas .
what you need to do there seems to be simply , but it &apos;s not . you have to do all the co2 that comes from the burning of the road , and then you can capture , under pressure , and then you &apos;re going to go somewhere
there are some of the things that are going to do on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it will be very difficult to get a lot of the time , and a agreement for the mental illness is a big challenge , but the biggest
who will make it make sure ?
who can guarantee something that literally many billion times larger than any kind of waste you can imagine from the other of the garbage and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a tough problem .
next : the next one .
and the other thing that has three big problems . the cost of all in the world &apos;s population are high , and the question of security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong despite the human cooperation , that the fuel is not used for
and what do you do with the garbage ?
because although he &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of thinking .
so three very difficult problems that may be soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve been in the last three .
it &apos;s renewables , as you often call .
and also , even though it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need fuel -- you have some drawbacks .
for one is the energy energy that creates these technologies dramatically than power power .
these are the most powerful , you &apos;re talking about many of the people &apos;s surface , 1,000 times more surface than a normal power station .
and also , these sources are the very subtle .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem to be all day , it doesn &apos;t seem every day and it doesn &apos;t seem to be the wind .
so you have to be , if you depend on these sources , you have a way to get energy in times , and you &apos;re not available to get .
so there &apos;s great design , and there &apos;s challenges in the transmission of transmission , and if we say that the energy source is outside the country , they don &apos;t need to just be the technology , they have to be able to deal with the risk
and there &apos;s the most important thing .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve all made the kinds of batteries that are made , looking at cars , computers , cell phones , cell phones , for everything . and i found that all batteries that are using the world , and i found that
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be 100 better than the approaches to time .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
that &apos;s what happens when you try to get these kinds of sources of the sources of the line , and we &apos;re going to get 20 percent of the rest of the rest .
if you want to do 100 percent of it , you need an incredible amount of energy .
now , where should we go : what is the right approach ?
&quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need is many companies working on this . hundreds .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
and you &apos;re going to say , you &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there &apos;s a lot of the ted group here that &apos;s already involved there .
bill big has several companies , under other people &apos;s great , a great thing called the great .
and the most interesting thing is to invest in dozens of companies that make great things and have interesting opportunities and i try to support it .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that , maybe surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the world &apos;s brain ; it &apos;s liquid , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry some time ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are sitting in .
the most important thing is that instead of one part of the world &apos;s brain , that one percent , the most powerful , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the most powerful .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it long , but you could never simulate a reasonable , whether it was working , but since there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that , yes , it &apos;s going to be a lot
and because you burn these 99 percent , the most powerful thing is much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of the today &apos;s waste as a more powerful .
instead of breaking the head , you just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is going to use it , a little bit like a candle .
you see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really solves the most powerful .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called the more of uranium uranium .
the bomb the u.s. government for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re cheap , and you just get a lot of fuel , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think of how we should measure our success .
how should our testimony look ?
now , let &apos;s go to the goal that we have to reach and then talk about the most powerful .
many of the people are talking about 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something agriculture , hopefully , and hopefully , it &apos;s going to be clean and cement to it .
so to reach these 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , their own , completely change .
the other grade says , if we use the world &apos;s technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is going to be a key thing that &apos;s going to be a key .
if we go back from there , how should the 2020 look at the 2020 ?
it should be the two elements .
we should use the most sophisticated to get reduction on the way . the less we &apos;re going to be more , the lower , the more , the more , the more , and the temperature .
but actually , this note is the things that we &apos;re doing , which is not completely to the big amount of energy , just the same , or even less important , or even less important as the other , which is the speed of innovation for these
this breakthroughs we have to pursue with the other , and we can measure that : in the world , in the world , in the world , in the world , and we can measure it in the world .
there are many great books to this topic .
the al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david &apos;s energy &apos;s energy , &quot; and david &apos;s energy &apos;s energy . &quot;
they really go through and create a frame where this can be discussed wide , because we need to support all sides of all sides .
there &apos;s a lot of that coming together .
this is a wish .
a very specific wish that we invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose this wish , which is , i could choose to take a little bit of the time ,
this is the largest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the dig between the long and short people are getting terrible , between the united states and china , between poor and rich , and almost all life of these two billion are very bad .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do ?
we need to use more research for more research .
if countries are meeting in places like the world &apos;s disease , they shouldn &apos;t only talk about co2 .
they should talk to these kinds of things , and they were shocked by the ridiculous amount of money that are spent for these innovative approaches .
we need a lot of carbon , co2 , competition &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; trade , something that creates a computer system .
we need to spread the message .
we need to have dialogue , and we have to lead the things that are going to be done by the government .
it &apos;s a more important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . just to understand a little better -- first , you can give us a notion of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , all the big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we only need some 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it works reasonable , you just
the difficult step is building the first of the first sea , more billion , to find the most important and the place of the first one .
once the first thing is , if he &apos;s going to be like this , it &apos;s all very clear , because the economic system , the energy , the energy energy , is as different as we know them .
to understand that , that means building deep in the ground almost like a vertical column nuclear energy , that uses the process and then start the process and work on the bottom ?
and so , right . now , you have to get the reactor , so there &apos;s a lot of people and many control , and many control that can go wrong . this thing where you open it and get things out of it . that &apos;s not
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can get it for 60 years -- think about a column -- you &apos;re buried , without all the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and it &apos;s going to be a million years and then it &apos;s done .
a computer company , which offers a solution to the garbage .
and so , yes , yeah . now , what happens to the garbage : you can sit it -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it and put it on the next reactor and burn it on the next reactor .
and we start by taking the waste , which is already exists in these kinds of things or the reactors in the reactors . that &apos;s our main system .
so , what was a problem for these reactors was what we put in our and that &apos;s dramatically reduced to the most dramatic while this process .
but while they talked about different people in the world about these possibilities .
where is the biggest interest , what really do ?
so , we haven &apos;t been determined to be a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting things that we have , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting things that are the &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name , and there are big interest and people
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is a version of one thing that was made .
this is a more important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries have built these , so everybody who has a quick reactor , a more important one for our first .
in your imagination , the point of time , and the probability of life is really to call it in life ?
so , we need one of these most powerful things , and we need one of these most powerful things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years .
this is kind of the deadline that we &apos;ve shown the most powerful thing that we need to follow .
and , you know , you know , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , that might be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of people who are , as if their approaches works , the funding of their pilots , to make it work for their pilots .
and it would be best if there &apos;s several , because then you could use a mixture .
and we need a solution to each case .
so , the big possible breakthroughs is that the biggest thing you know ?
and the most important thing is , a key thing is the most important thing .
it would have been without the most important , but it &apos;s the power of the power that it &apos;s more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know how to do this , but there &apos;s the modular method that is another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid of the , which seems to be a little difficult , but maybe the ones say that .
and so there are different , but the beautiful thing about it is that a million times a million times a million times as much energy as one , we say , a computer and therefore , if you can deal with the problems and the cost of the
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
we have to put it up to try to keep the most stable stable ?
and so , if you get into this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;ve eaten too much , and you &apos;re just a heart attack , and you can do it , you might need a heart attack or something like that .
there &apos;s a research research called the most powerful , which is involved in different techniques to vaccinate warming , so we have 20 or 30 years longer to get us to the world .
this is just a computer company .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t just work on insurance because maybe it &apos;s a lazy , so you &apos;re eating , because you know that a heart rate will save .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart when you get the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in the world &apos;s brain , whether you should have that available to the things that you have to get , if things are going faster
climate change : have you a or two sentences for that to convince you ?
so , the number of things : well , unfortunately , the skeptic in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say that there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that are moving things ?
there are very , very few things you can tell you about , which is a chance to be a million .
this is how it &apos;s like aids .
you &apos;re doing the mistakes now , and you pay for it very much later .
and so the idea is , now , if you all have possible problems , in something you &apos;ve only got later -- and that &apos;s where the investment is not so clear . actually , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst scenario and there &apos;s people
the fact is that these uncertainty should be concerned .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and the co2 is going to be wiped out , then the skeptic says , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not a co2 , i wish it &apos;s not a co2 , i wish it &apos;s
and that would be their answer to the most important argument that if you use all these time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals that are going to be suffering by malaria and so on that it &apos;s a stupid waste of resources
so , the real time , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year than you do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
it shouldn &apos;t suffer other things .
you get to big sums of money , and here you can disagree with reasonable people if you have something that &apos;s not economically , and tries to fund that .
it &apos;s because , you &apos;re very short at a very short and funded only the learning learning , and i think we should try to do more things that have the potential , very much cheaper .
if the sticky , you get a very high , very high , very high , you can only keep the rich .
i mean , every one of us could spend five times so much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even more , it &apos;s thinking .
his new computer system is now : &quot; why don &apos;t the research be spoken ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to be , because of his former stories , associated with the most powerful , but he understood that this is a very lonely group and therefore he &apos;s going to get the most lonely group .
and that &apos;s a train that i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little the support is going to be .
bill , i think i &apos;m going to talk for almost all people here when i say , i &apos;m really hoping you &apos;re going to be true . thank you very much .
so , thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , peter &apos;s ted &apos;s book , peter &apos;s &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
the idea is quite simple . the highest thing is , the biggest thing to do with 20 spaghetti structure , about a meter of tape , about a meter , and build a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be up on top .
and , although it really seems to be really hard , it &apos;s really hard to work because people are doing very quickly .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a computer scanner .
it was a huge success .
since i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , engineers and architects , even with the most powerful of the world &apos;s brain and there &apos;s something that &apos;s going to allow the deep sensations to do in nature , and i want to
usually most people start to get themselves to the task .
they talk about it , they think of how it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to look .
then you invest a little bit of time in planning and organization . you draw and put spaghetti .
they &apos;re going to invest in the most common way in the world &apos;s office .
and finally , shortly before they don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow and they put it carefully on the top , and they &apos;re going to go back to the top , and they admire their work .
but then , almost always , it &apos;s going to happen , that the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the marshmallow is going to be a &quot; the marshmallow , &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow is going to bend and
there &apos;s a series of people who have much more &quot; the &quot; early &quot; in the world , and under the worst , fresh water systems are fresh .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and they &apos;re really making a little bit of the shape .
and of course , there are teams that have a lot more &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the best &quot; and the best are fresh students in the world &apos;s best .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , they didn &apos;t just have the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is : how does this come ? why ? what about that ?
and peter said , &quot; none of the children are invested at the time of spaghetti sauce . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest at any time .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that &apos;s that the most powerful thing that was trained to find a real plan , ok !
and then it &apos;s going to realize .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s different is that they start to build the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , so they have the opportunity to repair the possibility of the way they have the opportunity to repair prototypes .
and the way that they see this kind of collaboration is the core of a design model .
and with every trial , the kids are getting immediately feedback , and what doesn &apos;t .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , much -- but let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
the average for most of the time is to create the most of the , and the half of them are , and not much more , but not much , they &apos;re better than adults .
who is most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
the second meter is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they &apos;re going to understand triangles and they &apos;re the key geometric patterns to build the key structure .
ceos are something about average , but there &apos;s interesting .
you put an old-fashioned administrator on the team , you &apos;ll get significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see , and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why does it go ?
because they have special skills of the world &apos;s brain .
they lead the process , they understand it .
and this team , that &apos;s going to be able to make the performance and the work is going to be significantly improving the performance of the team .
specialized skills and the combination of success and their combination of success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical thing you get is about six , the stable structures .
i tried something interesting now .
i thought we &apos;re going to get the same way .
so i offered a $ 10,000 prize to software for the winner .
what did you think happened with these things ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone built a high construction , he had carried the price home .
so is it not interesting that high , high effect have a strong effect ?
we repeated these practice with the same students .
what did you think happened now ?
now she understood the advantage of the prototyping .
so , from the same , bad team of one of the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there &apos;s lessons for us to do the nature of the drive and success .
you like , why would someone actually invest in time to create a more powerful ?
the reason is , i help digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and visual , &quot; visual . &quot;
and what the most important thing is , it helps you identify them hidden .
because frankly , every project has his own marshmallow .
the challenge provides a common experience , a common language or attitude , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this kind of simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in the world can go to the world .
it &apos;s a blog where you see the marshmallow building .
there &apos;s a computer game there .
they find crazy examples of all the world , as people optimize the system and the system .
there are also a lot of time .
and the lesson , i think , is actually a kind of a sport sport , actually , a sport sport .
it requires that we all have our senses on the task , and we &apos;re using our thinking of the way we &apos;re using our feelings and our feelings , in the challenge that lies before us .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that it needs to bring us from a &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the moment &quot; -- to bring a &quot; &quot; the moment &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
let &apos;s have a machine that we have here .
a big machine , a cool machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everybody in this room has to be inside .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now stay .
and i wonder what they would choose because i &apos;ve been asking my friends last time , and they wanted to go all the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before they were cars or twitter or &quot; america &quot; .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced you kind of cut to the brush , to be drawn to the brush .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go in the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a emperor of a biography .
it &apos;s that possibilities are not going back to this planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that we &apos;ve ever been on this planet , no matter what scale they do : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining , declining .
there was never a time before that .
my favorite school died all of them were going to be 60 .
my grandparents are going to be on 70 .
my parents are 80 on the most popular .
so there should be a nine at the beginning of my favorite .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child that &apos;s born in new delhi is going to be like to live as long as the richest man on the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox is killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;ve created the demographics of the earth on a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we have it . pop .
in the rich world , diseases are more threatened by the millions of us just a generation of a generation , hardly yet .
and the most powerful , polio , polio ...
anybody still knows what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , that are successes of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try to see , look , whether it works , it changes if it doesn &apos;t do that , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , this is all the good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , it &apos;s going to go hungry every day in the world every day .
this number goes up , and it goes very quickly , and that &apos;s a shame .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to trash this world .
drinking water , the land , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , and if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , we &apos;re going to go out and be not going to be going to be the chaos .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t have at the same time .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a very reactive .
but this is what i &apos;m going to hold up at night -- one of the things that i &apos;m awake at night , we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as well as now , never , never , never , never , never , never yet , never
and we were still able to get it out of it , so it &apos;s like we can today .
we &apos;re at the threshold of amazing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think we &apos;d have to go hundreds of , 300 years ago , to find a time where we have a lot of time to get the progress of the time
people are going to be able to do it in their faith , and that &apos;s so closely that you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth is going to free it .
and listen , everybody has a right on his mind ; even a fairly right thing to do .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
they don &apos;t have a right to their own facts . &apos; sorry , they don &apos;t have .
and i took a while to figure out that .
about a decade ago , i wrote a paper about the new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed to go to resistance , on resistance to what the most effective activity in health care is in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what should i do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote a paper and drove .
and soon , i wrote a paper about genetically changed food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i wrote a paper about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; , why they believed that molecules were a specific way of moving a random way of doing a random way of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept doing it .
i mean , i &apos;m journalist .
we type , we &apos;re going to go to food , we &apos;re going to eat that , that &apos;s okay .
but this article made me worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these fellows were doing that , and they were not a carpenter who were doing it at all .
these were the people who were educated people , a decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that was so mess .
but then i thought , you know what , we &apos;re honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as used .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking about it , with little criticism , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , so there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what causes that .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
chernobyl , the pavement , the pavement , the atomic weapons , the mass of the age of 2,000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people that we believed that they were always right . so , they &apos;re skeptical .
imagine , demand evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything like that .
but now , if you have to get evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can say that we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story published a terrible story , a terrible story that the most prolific , the most powerful , and the vaccine , and the vaccine , brought up in connection .
very scary .
many studies were done to see if that was true .
many studies should be done ; this is a serious thing .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we think we &apos;re really feeling .
we don &apos;t believe in a cluster of documents , which gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was devastating .
catastrophic because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the thought-controlled is falling down for the .
this is a lot of the time , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happens is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do that .
because anybody &apos;s going to put it up here ?
has one in the audience ever die in the audience ?
it &apos;s not very often happening .
it &apos;s not happening in this country , but the other year in the world , the last year .
these are many deaths through nashville , 20 per hour .
but because this is not happening here , we can do it in denial , and people like jenny can walk around and the messages of fear and the other of the people like oprah and larry king live .
and that can do it because they don &apos;t connect and connection .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same thing .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas haring .
he was going to be in the worst of the world &apos;s worst world &apos;s worst .
no fear , no distress , polio , shoot , disappeared .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul &apos;s .
he just developed a few other people &apos;s people .
he can save the lives of the world &apos;s lives , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
now , this is good , besides that paul talks about vaccines and about vaccines and says how valuable they are , and that people should just stop to shave .
and it actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul talks in a public health system , he can &apos;t tell you without a half of the guards .
he gets calls home , because people like to tell him that they know where their children go to school .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
you take them on , return the diseases back , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we now have now wired in this country .
and that &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon children will die again because it &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die in the blink of them .
what about polio ? do we take this . why not ?
a little bit of mine wrote me a few weeks ago , and i said , i &apos;m a little too sharp .
nobody ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against polio . no case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe someone &apos;s going to go in lagos , and i &apos;m going to go to los angeles , right now , in the moment , he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he lands and a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to go to one of these most popular things tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a finite disease , and we don &apos;t know , because the world works now .
this is the planet we live on . don &apos;t do that as if it &apos;s not .
we love to go to lying . we love that .
do you have all the money tomorrow ?
and a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a sudden that helps you to get on the brakes .
i know that they did that because half the americans do that every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make a difference , as often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data is constantly showing .
they &apos;re putting their urine . more they never do .
this is okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i &apos;m going to give you completely .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate a too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we should not do that . our healthcare system is a huge .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing , and it &apos;s a little bit of a cold self to do it .
so we &apos;re running away , and where do we walk ?
we &apos;re running in the poor of the world &apos;s arms .
this is great . i love the most powerful .
but you know , this is really a serious thing , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars for it .
and i &apos;ve all got a little bit of little little bit of the little little bit of the time .
no one -- the most important , was , the , was , i was , i &apos;m not even , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re not going to give you what that is , but we &apos;re giving billions of dollars
and you know what ? if i say that , people shout up and say , &quot; what does it take ? let &apos;s do the people , what they want .
so you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you have wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the health minister , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or any of the other things that want to treat his patients with the patient &apos;s
if you &apos;re going to get out of this way , where and magic evidence and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to the south africa in south africa .
he brought 400,000 his people because he was that red went to the , and it was much more effective than a antiretroviral drugs , which we know that they can be able to get the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country that will be worse than any other of these disease is going to be .
i don &apos;t ask you that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the main epidemic that we &apos;re just in is that this ridiculous struggle between the most sophisticated is driven by the most powerful food and the most powerful .
this is a debate . it &apos;s got to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every branch of the body , every branch , is the other , and every calorie , it &apos;s changed by the people .
you know , there was no a more powerful in paradise .
there was no one .
there was no one . we did all this .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them has worked and some of them don &apos;t .
we &apos;re washed out , which doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more closely . and of course , there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , their lives .
does you want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re thriving , we &apos;re going to be genetically modified food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m hearing is to be , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , we don &apos;t want a huge fields with one thing that is wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer is to all this ?
yes , you &apos;re right . we fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge amount of light , but it &apos;s not science .
it doesn &apos;t have to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , the moral .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes he works and sometimes not , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work because we &apos;re afraid of a real dead , and it &apos;s holding millions of people from the flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years we have to grow 70 percent more food than in the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . shame .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? genetically changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this kind of thing , like , for example , to be a more , like , for example , to be a more , like , for example .
and the one is something that is a half billion people eating .
it &apos;s about a potato .
it &apos;s just a strands of calories . it &apos;s a huge .
it has no nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists build all this .
and then people could be eating food and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be 16,000 , but it would be beautiful .
and everything i can say is , why do we fight that ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves , why do we fight that ?
because we don &apos;t want to move genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our romanticism on greater food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice &apos;s , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re doing that as far as we do , we &apos;re going to think about something that we think , not guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description of what happens here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of our , and we need to really stop it .
so after that incredibly funny conversation , you might say , &quot; do you want to go in this ridiculous time machine and the future ? &quot;
anyway , i want to go on every case .
now , in the moment , you &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time machine on everything we want .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we will move them up where we want .
we need to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the time time and go into the future , we &apos;re going to be happy to have that .
i know that we can , and so far it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time i &apos;m interested in the most important , it &apos;s strange that a magician is interested in it , because it &apos;s like i think , as a deception , that &apos;s going to be a little bit of a real time , if someone &apos;s
with other words , sugar sugar have shown a measurable effect , which is the most powerful , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what happens to her , is a more powerful or a kind of ...
a deception becomes something really , because somebody &apos;s so aware of it .
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that is at least for the 1950s in every single single way for children .
i &apos;ve learned it from the most of the magic magic magic of the korean magic of the shrine .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can study ; my hand , which you can study .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife so on .
i push my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or out of him , i &apos;m just going to get my wrist right here .
and you can see that you can see that no time is moving anything . as long as i &apos;m here , nothing can go in my sleeve or come out .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes good , the knife will be held through my naked physical magnetism .
it actually is so stuck in his place that i can shake it without the knife .
nothing goes in my sleeve or come out , no more , no , you can see everything .
and the most powerful !
now , this is a trick i often do little kids , which are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you &apos;re looking at it , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you here in the room are going to be here .
he works like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to make my wrist , to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m going to get my wrist is that it &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
because in the moment , where i &apos;m going to do my hand from you , you see it from the back , moving this finger here , and this finger , just from there , where he was , in a position where he was so extended .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody sitting back to the back of the back .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i &apos;m going to get out of the fingers , the fingers changes his position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there are only three fingers down here : because the mind and the way he &apos;s making information is not a , two , three , three , but it looks
but this is not what it &apos;s going on here . and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s going to be held there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my little , which is now there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing happens by making me hidden , and that &apos;s the finger that the finger is going back .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can demonstrate your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the most powerful ?
a year ago , i read a study that really blew me right .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and that &apos;s why it was a amazing thing for me .
it turns out that , if you offer a placebo placebo in a white pill in the form of a white pill , it &apos;s just a round , white pill , which has a certain measurable effect .
but if you give the shape that you give the placebo placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and this blue color , and a letter , is actually measurable , it &apos;s actually measurable .
and that , although no one &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a sudden -- it &apos;s just sugar .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? i really got out of it .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
if you take a little bit more effective , the more effective than pills are every form .
a colored capsule , which is a single yellow and the other red , is better than a white capsule .
the dose is a role .
a pill twice is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics , i &apos;m sorry . sorry .
but the key thing is ...
... that also the doses of play .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate , you have to reach to the needle .
right ? a syringe with a computer company -- a few of the most powerful substance that you &apos;re being able to be able to be able to be able to do .
this creates a very strong picture in your head , and this is very much stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a deck of a pit .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work so well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work so well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and nothing of it has a really more powerful property . it &apos;s just our belief that we have a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;m going to take something that obviously is a deception , and let &apos;s look at it .
we know that you have to reach out of the needle , if it &apos;s going to go to the thing .
this is a 18 inches long , and it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very much , and i &apos;m going to first get it a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not a special amount of life .
this is my skin . this is not a special part of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle in my skin and take through it through it , until you put on the other side .
if you &apos;re going to be bad -- if you fall easily in the way -- i &apos;ve shown a few friends last night in hotel room , and some people who i didn &apos;t know , and it &apos;s been a woman almost powerless .
so i propose if you &apos;re going to be very bad , you look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first sensitive part here .
you can see it right now , but you can also be able to do it , if you want .
so , it &apos;s like this , right here , where my flesh is going to be , i &apos;m just going to make a little bit of a very low-tech .
do i really sorry . do you do that crazy ?
and now just a little bit of my skin and on the other side , it &apos;s so much out of the way .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the same situation .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid and the skin , and the skin , just to talk to us a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;ll show you .
how does this look like this ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people in the back say , &quot; okay . i don &apos;t see that right . &quot;
people in the world are now coming in .
let me show you from the close .
this is really my skin . this is not a special part of hollywood .
this is my flesh , and i can turn it down .
sorry . if you &apos;re going to be bad , you don &apos;t look at it .
people in the back or the ones that eventually look at video , say , &quot; well , this is really impressive , but if it was real , it would be a hole , and if it really would be real , it would be a hole and
okay , let me give you a little blood for you .
yeah , here &apos;s it .
i usually would take the needle .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this frame here , and with the intent , a little bit of a real thing , i &apos;m going to just leave the needle in there and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to be a few times in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re happy to do it . thank you very much .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i &apos;ve been able to count some people who have been published with happiness , which was published in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and there were a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness .
there &apos;s a lot of the time .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these tide of work , there are several cognitive deaths that are kind of impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly going to be the cognitive .
that &apos;s true for the most important , thinking about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out we &apos;re just as mess as any other .
the first of these fall is a very , complexity , to admit .
it turns out that the word is not a useful word , because we &apos;re using it too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could just be able to do , but in the big and all the time , that &apos;s something we need to give up , and we will take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is a sense of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s in the way between happy in his life and happy to his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both the most powerful in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the most powerful , and that &apos;s the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affects well-being without the meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive case .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now i &apos;d like to start with a example of someone who had a computer company after one of my lectures , who was a story . &#91; unclear &#93; &#93; he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and it was
and then he added , really , really emotionally , that &apos;s ruined all the experience .
but that didn &apos;t .
what it was ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of music .
they don &apos;t care because he was a memory of a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had to keep .
what &apos;s really telling us that we could think about other people and thinking about other people in the sense of two species of self .
there &apos;s a little bit of a time that lives in the present and the present , and the present is to experience the past again , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the most important self that the doctor &apos;s doctor -- you know , if the doctor says , &quot; do it hurt if i &apos;m going to be here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a more powerful self , and the most important self is that the most powerful and the story of our lives are getting upright , and it &apos;s that the doctor is going to be able to address the question , &quot; how did you
or &quot; like , &quot; the journey of albania ? &quot; or something like this .
these are two very different units , the most powerful self , and the most powerful self , and the two is part of the most powerful of the most exciting of the happiness of happiness .
well , the most important self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories if we do that , to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories that is called what we can keep from our experience .
and let &apos;s start with a example of a example .
there &apos;s a old study .
these are real patients who put a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who has more than that ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has suffered more . his favorite was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a patient , a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much thought that patients , they suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a a much worse more worse thing had a lot worse than a patient b.
the stories of the most powerful , and because a very critical part of the story is like they end -- it ends up .
and no one of these stories is very , very , great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is clear than the other .
and the worse thing is , where the pain was very on the end of his peak , it &apos;s a bad story .
where do we know that ?
because we asked these people to be asked , and also much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing in the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was a lot worse for a half for b in the world &apos;s office .
now , this is a direct conflict between the most powerful self and the most powerful self .
from the point of view of the world &apos;s brain , b clearly had a worse time .
now what you could do with patient a do , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s done , you could actually be the most sophisticated of patient a increase by just to shake it into a very much .
that &apos;s going to lead the patient , but only a little bit less than before .
and if you do a few minutes , you have to make that the most important self is a bad thing , and you have it that the most powerful self is a much better , because now you have a better story about his experience .
what &apos;s a story of this ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that gives us memory and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we invent .
and what a story is about is a little bit of a time , significant moments and end .
end , very important , very important and in this case , dominated the end .
well , the most important self is alive .
it has moments of the most powerful , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really easy . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve got this -- you know , the psychological present as about three seconds , which means , you know , you know , in a life about 600 million of them . most of you are leaving
most of you are completely ignored by the most of the time .
and yet , you get the impression that you should count that what happens during this moments of the world &apos;s life is our lives .
it &apos;s limited resource that we use as we are on this world .
and as we would use them , it seems important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the most important self for us .
so we have the most important self , and the most powerful self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is to deal with time .
from the point of view , if you have a vacation and the second week , the second week is like the first , then the vacation vacation is twice as good as the most powerful holiday .
this is not working at all the time of the self .
for the most important self , a vacation vacation is hardly better than the most powerful holiday , because there &apos;s no new memories of the day .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that is different from a single one of the people &apos;s lives , and time has very little influence on this story .
well , the most important self is doing more than remember and tell stories .
it &apos;s actually that the decisions is true , because if you have a patient who &apos;s saying , we have two different surgeons in two different surgeons , and decides what he should choose , then the one is the one that &apos;s going to be the memory
the most important self has no voice in this choice .
we don &apos;t really choose between experiences . we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we usually don &apos;t think about our future as experiences .
we think about our future as a more powerful memories .
and basically , you can see that , you know , when a legitimate of the brain &apos;s self , and you can think of the most important self as one , which is a kind of the kind of thing that &apos;s going to be the most important
i have the impression that if we &apos;re doing vacation , that &apos;s very often the case that is called , we &apos;re doing vacation in the service of the brain itself .
and that &apos;s a little bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we do from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that will be given for the dominance of the brain &apos;s self .
and if i think about it , i think in a vacation that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best holiday i had ever had , and i think relatively often in relation to how often i think of other things
and i probably have from my memories of these things , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the folder with 600 images , i spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s just a half hours .
there &apos;s a shoreline to give it a mosquito .
now , i like a little bit of a very extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the most powerful of memories , but even if you &apos;re going to do more of it , why do we give memories so much weight in the
so i want you to think about a thought .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the world &apos;s office , all your images are being wiped out , and you get a drug drug , so you &apos;re not going to remember anything .
now , would you choose the same holiday ?
and if you would choose another holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species of self and you have to think about how you decide this conflict and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think about the sense of time , you can get
why we choose the most powerful , which we choose is a problem that turns out to us with a choice between the two species of self .
now , the two species of self throw two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts from happiness that we can apply to one itself .
so you can ask : how happy is the most powerful self ?
and then they would ask : how happy are the moments in life of the world &apos;s life ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of happiness of the most exciting self about time .
if you ask the happiness of the world &apos;s happiness , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this is not how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s like happy or pleased , and the person is , if this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
everybody who &apos;s not going to be different is the exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m going to be a lot of researchers about well-being that have been the exploration of happiness for happiness .
the distinction between happiness of the most exciting self and happiness is recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re going to be able to measure the two of the people &apos;s rights .
the key organization has a global survey , which has been asked more than half a million people , which are what they think about their lives and about their experiences . and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started learning about the happiness of the two species of self .
and the main lesson we think is , i &apos;ve learned that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and it really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation that is about a matter of the correlation .
what that means that if you would meet somebody and you would tell you , oh , his father is a computer &apos;s office , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody has his life as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his own .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what happiness is determined to .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know happiness is mostly happy to be happy with people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the most of the two species of self , you &apos;re going to do very different things at the end .
the conclusion of what i said here is that we really shouldn &apos;t think of ourselves as a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very short , another reason we can &apos;t realize about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are going to be in california , they &apos;re not going to get the correct answer .
if you think that the question of the question you think that people have to be happier when they say , in ohio , we live in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , we say , in climate .
now , it turns out that climate is not very important for the most important self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the most powerful self , which decides how happy people are .
but , because the most powerful self is responsible , you can go on the end -- some people could move on the end of california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track what happens with people who are going to go to california , happier .
well , you &apos;re not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . they &apos;re going to think they &apos;re happier because if they &apos;re going to think about it , they &apos;re going to be remembered , how awful the weather was in ohio . and they &apos;re going to feel that they
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question to you .
thank you .
now , when we talked about a few weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting result that came from this , which came from this , that was a pretty interesting survey .
is that something you can do , because you &apos;ve got a few minutes left ?
daniel &apos;s : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the world &apos;s favorite survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find absolutely .
we found this in terms of happiness itself .
if we looked at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars a year in the
60,000 .
and the 60,000 : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year are unhappy , and they &apos;re getting more happy , the poorer they will be .
we get a perfectly flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money is not going to be a more powerful , but that lack of money is certainly a miserable , and we can get this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the most important thing , you get another story .
the more money you deserve is the more likely you .
it &apos;s not true for emotions .
but danny , in the entire american effort , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this kind of thing seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on the head , everything we believe for example , for example , in terms of the way we believe in terms of the way .
there &apos;s a chance that politicians , that the country in general would be a more powerful like the serious and doing politics ?
so , you know , you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of the politics in politics .
the recognition will be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening and in other countries , it &apos;s just happening .
people are in the way they think they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to study the way they &apos;re going to study or whether they want to study the discussion , so we have to get this discussion pretty soon .
how do you get happiness is very different to be able to think about how you think and whether you think about the most important self or whether you think about the most important self .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you &apos;re going to measure the most important of the population .
that &apos;s going to be , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistic .
well , it seems to me , this topic is going to be , or should at least the most interesting political debate to track the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny &apos;s .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
now i &apos;ve been developing for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in reality , as you &apos;re in the world &apos;s disease .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , including all of them , more time with playing greater and more and more and more .
now we spend three billion hours a week with a week .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a whole lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we &apos;re really concerned about in the real world .
but in fact , my research on the institute of the future is exactly the opposite of the opposite .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the most common problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increase this time dramatically .
i have calculated that the time is going to be a week at 21 billion hours per week .
this is perhaps a little bit more useful , so i &apos;ll repeat it , so that it can be , if we &apos;re problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think , we need to try to play games online
no , i really mean it seriously .
why ? this picture is pretty precisely , why i believe that games are so vital for survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographers phil .
he wanted to catch the feelings in play . so he has built a camera in front of the players .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you may be able to get some of the nuances in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also a lot of concentration , and it &apos;s really a very difficult problem in the way that you &apos;re going to solve a real problem .
if you play , you see some of the bureaucratic ones that are going on to the top of the eyes and the mouth of optimism , and the eyebrows show surprise . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player who stands on the edge of a so-called epic .
oh , you know that . ok . okay . so we have some players here .
a very positive victory is a result that is so much positive that it &apos;s not that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and if you reach it , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually able to do something like this . that &apos;s a kind of a victory victory .
this player is short a very short victory .
and this is what we have to see on millions of faces of the world , if we take the barriers of the next century in attack , the face of the next century , the face of the world &apos;s way to be a epic of a epic
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re going to see this face in real life when we &apos;re very difficult to meet problems .
i call it the &quot; in life , &quot; i &apos;m bad , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
i &apos;m like i &apos;m going to do that in life , i &apos;m bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. , where we &apos;re in play better than in the real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not so good in reality as well as play .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , although it &apos;s heard .
we &apos;re going to get more . i mean , in the context of the motivation , something significant to do , inspired with the collaboration .
if we &apos;re in a computer factory , i think that many of us turn into our best version , anytime and immediately helpful , and to solve the problem , so long as necessary , it &apos;s going to try to get it back to the most important
and in reality , if we &apos;re failing , if we &apos;re going to get to obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or unable .
these feelings have never been , if we play games , there are just not .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible to think , you can &apos;t just do anything ?
how can we transmit these feelings from play in reality ?
so i looked like the world of warcraft , which offers the ideal environment to collaborative problem .
and i &apos;ve found some things that are going to be able to make the epic wins in the field of time .
so first , when you get in one of these things , especially world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to be willing to get a mission mission , and immediately .
but not only any mission , but a mission that fits perfect to your current level in the game ?
so they do that .
they never get a task that you can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of your skills , you have to work . but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and it &apos;s going to be a little bit important . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are lots of employees .
where they &apos;re going to go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to close their epic mission .
so , we don &apos;t have that just in the real life that &apos;s going to be willing to be willing to be prepared to be a lot of employees .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , these inspiring story , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve been going to have a level of level , and &quot; + one strength &quot; or &quot; + one of the intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in real life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t say , + 1 , and + a crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in the real life of this feedback .
so the problem of the world &apos;s problem as world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying at all at the edge of a epic , and that we &apos;re going to spend our whole time in these kinds of times .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of the world &apos;s world has spent millions of years to solve the virtual problems of the world &apos;s virtual problems .
this is not necessarily bad .
it may sound bad .
but to see it in context , the millions of years ago , our first favorite years ago , our first favorite .
so the first visit primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend with play , it &apos;s just a sense of what &apos;s going on when you &apos;re going to be in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinarily .
but also , it &apos;s also appropriate . because it turns out we use this whole time to play this whole time , actually change what we &apos;re able to do as humans .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative thinking , and we &apos;re going to be able to do a lot of creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i think it &apos;s .
so , look at this interesting statistic that was published recently from a researcher of carnegie mellon university : the average boy of today in a country with huge design of 10,000 hours of a year to the 21st of the year .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , the most accurate hours of the world are the exact most accurate , which they spend in school , from the five grade to the end of high school .
so we have a complete whole kind of a complete , on the young people , which means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; the &quot; s , &quot; read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of the world &apos;s great research that if we spend 10,000 hours with the defining study of any subject to the 21st , we will be to master .
we &apos;re going to be so good at doing what the most important people in the world are .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are the most powerful .
so the big question is , &quot; what are players going to be doing ? &quot;
because if we could find that , we would never have been able to have a human potential to have a human potential .
so many people are currently in the world that spend at least one hour a day with a day .
these are our main systems . 500 million people , the extraordinary good in &quot; something . &quot;
and the next decade we have another billion players that are extraordinary in what are still .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the most powerful thing is that the energy is saving , and the energy is working on the ground , instead of the most powerful , so that player on the world , in the world , in india , in india , in india , in india .
you expect a extra billion players in the next decade .
so we &apos;ve been in total billion players .
so i started thinking , what it is to do is to make this games .
here &apos;s the four things i found . first , the first one .
ok , imagine how extreme the extreme world &apos;s most extreme .
and the desire is to do something immediately to do a sense of a barrier , with believing that we have an aquatic hope on success .
players always believe that a computer &apos;s victory is possible , and that it &apos;s always worth trying to try and do it .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters of the spiders in spiders .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show people more after we played with them , even if they &apos;ve been defeated to us , even if they were defeated .
the reason that it is a lot of trust is to play a game with someone .
we trust that somebody &apos;s time to spend us , that the rules are being honored , that we have the same goal and to be the same thing .
so the most important thing is that the most sophisticated thing is that the ties of ties , trust and each other .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
the productivity of productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the most powerful of the world &apos;s time is playing 22 hours a week , as a result of a week .
the reason is , if we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than if we relax or nothing .
we know that as human beings , we &apos;re going to work as a human being , and we &apos;re doing hard work .
and players are always willing to work hard if they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to become part of awe of the world &apos;s brain &apos;s size .
here &apos;s a computer company to go back to the right light , and you know all wikipedia , the largest wiki of the world .
the second second of the world , with almost 80,000 yearning , is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about the world of warcraft in the internet than any other topic in each other in the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome . players are more hopeful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is that you can believe you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward ornish is a computer company .
his work is great . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in the field of time .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to be witnesses from not less than a more powerful in virtual worlds and the world &apos;s . &quot;
and that &apos;s an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like me -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit more nuanced .
so he says that it &apos;s actually going to make sense , because players can achieve more than the real life .
you can make stronger social bonds than in the real life , and you get more feedback and rewards in play as in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s absolutely logical that players are more time in virtual world than in the real way .
i just agree with that , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not a more powerful .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from a event that &apos;s 2,500 years of a year .
there are these ancient cube , from the world &apos;s knowledge . you know ?
this fantastic thing was , there was a lot of the time .
and that was kind of the first of people developed .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the old greek , you may know this story , and the story about how and why games were invented .
according to the games , games were invented , more specifically , in the kingdom of famine , in the kingdom of famine .
there was such a big famine that the king of the king of the king was decided to be a crazy idea .
people suffered . people fought .
it was a extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
so they invented , according to the most powerful , the most popular and the cdc , and a national strategy , you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the most powerful , because games are so fascinating and we &apos;re surrounded with the most amazing , and they were surrounded with the productivity that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to the way they survived this , they were going to survive for 18 years , by eating the day , and they played on the next .
so , i think , let &apos;s take games today .
we &apos;re going to play games to get the suffering of the real world .
we &apos;re going to play games to get everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , not in the real life , and we &apos;re going to get what we need to do .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s exciting .
according to the day , the famine was not better for 18 years , so the king , the king , a last computer company .
they shared the kingdom in two camps .
they played a computer company and they were allowed to break the first one to a epic adventure .
they left the way they were looking at the search for a new home , and they just put so many people back , like food to survive and looked at the rest of the way they could flourish .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest main , the most recent , the most prolific , the last thing that the roman empire was going to be the same dna as the old dna .
so scientists were going to be a thought that the crazy story is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global cooling , which took almost 20 years , which was the famine .
so this crazy story could be voices .
maybe you have saved your people through play by having 18 years in games , and then they had the most powerful and so much over each other playing that they &apos;ve saved the entire civilization .
so , we can also .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 since 1994 .
this was the first thing in real time in the world of the world &apos;s world , and that was 16 years ago .
they were playing 18 years for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i &apos;m going to say we &apos;re ready for our own business game .
so , they sent half their civilization to search for a new world , so i take my 21 billion a week .
we should have predicted that half of us have a day with play a day with play , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of real world in play ? &quot; and that question i have in the last few years , i &apos;ve been dedicated to the future for the future .
we have this kind of light in our office in palo alto , and it &apos;s going to press how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to introduce the best outcome . and then people are making it to make this idea in reality .
we &apos;re going to be able to get a epic , and we give people the possibilities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you a very short three games that i designed to try to get people to get to the future of their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a computer that you have to overcome a computer company .
the most important thing is , but we have enough to do it for you , and it &apos;s really realistic to you , and you actually live with your real life without oil , so if you &apos;re going to be a game , you &apos;re going to
we tested this game with the taxis players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied by the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a change experience .
nobody wants to change life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure , and you &apos;ll get , &quot; we &apos;re going to get oil out . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going to go .
find out how they would survive . most of our players have been able to keep the game in the game .
so we have a bigger game , and we put a bigger , higher goal than just a little bit more .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
starting is the calculation of a computer &apos;s computation that people have only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global design system , &quot; of course .
the call of gamers , we have almost designed as a &quot; aw &quot; system .
you know jerry &apos;s , where it &apos;s the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot;
but in our game , instead of only five people , we say , everybody is in the most violent , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they &apos;re &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the last game we get in march , it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you end the game , you get the award of the world &apos;s population , &quot; social design , &quot; in 2010 .
we work with universities in sub-saharan africa and store , to learn social cooling .
we have a comic comic . we have the level up to the &quot; level &quot; for the &quot; level , sustainability , vision and ingenuity . &quot;
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people everywhere on the world , especially in the world , especially in the world , which benefit to be their own social enterprise to save the world .
i &apos;m going to go to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use in the real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have this whole superpowers , the ability to make productivity , the ability to make close social nets , and the desire to make meaning .
i really hope that we play significant games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design with me , and play .
when i was in the next decade , i &apos;m sure i &apos;m sure that we can make any future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the most powerful games .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about what i was writing a few months ago in a paper for a little bit of a paper .
i always have my favorite seat on the day , but i was working with the book of text , and i fell on , and i fell on that i never had a life in my life , which is the word &quot; disabled &quot; really means .
i read you the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; more common , &quot; the more helpless , helpless , useless , destroyed , &quot; break , wounded , wounded , broken , and they were injured , and they were injured , and they were injured , and they were injured , and they
and the more healthy , healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
i read this list of a friend according to a friend , and i had to laugh , and i was just going to be able to get it to &quot; &quot; and i was just going to be &quot; beaten up , &quot; and i had to get
of course , this was a computer company , old , old , and i just thought that the copy has to be quite old .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early &apos; 80s when i started with elementary school , and i started building my self outside my family level and form to form the other way around the other children and the rest of me around .
and thank god so much , i &apos;m not using a more sophisticated time .
i would be doing this post seriously , i was born in a world that someone like me would perceive as a person who could be able to do a person in any way , but today i &apos;m going to have the opportunity to have the opportunity to
so i immediately have the most popular of 2009 , and i expected to find a piece of a piece of contribution here .
here &apos;s the most popular version of this kind of thing .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
especially , the last two words , the last two words , &quot; &quot; close &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we build these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many ancient societies , including the greeks and the roman , have really believed that the curvature of a computer &apos;s a big force has a big force because that &apos;s what you can do , also , it can be a big force .
so what do we really want to anticipate -- a disabled human or a powerful human ?
and it &apos;s a human being , as a child , to call it a child , it could be , you know , and you &apos;re going to be able to make ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open doors ?
a human being , which opened for me , was my pediatrician at the most violent institute in the world &apos;s office in the prison room in the prison room .
he &apos;s called dr. &apos;s favorite . a computer company whose name , like you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t be correct . so he always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. always wore very colorful flies and was just made for kids like created .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my favorite .
i had to be able to do it , and i had to be able to get infinitely , and i had to be able to get it to these big , elastic , elastic , different colors -- you know , to build my favorite , and i
and imagine , i even have a child &apos;s child with dr. p. , and so i tried to stop this practice , and i &apos;m trying to stop this practice without success .
and one day he looked at me at one of my practice -- these practice were just tiring and a little bit of a time -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;ll
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this was just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that the richest five girls in the hospital are going to be in the second stick , but it actually got me to see
and i ask myself today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl has shaped my self and i could imagine that as a nature of nature , powerful and more powerful human beings .
this is just an example of many , as adults can encourage the imagination of a child .
but as the most important examples of the world &apos;s own , we can &apos;t prove our language , and we don &apos;t think about what we all wish to do : it &apos;s every single one to see themselves as a powerful human .
our language is the social change behind the social change that has been caused by a technological change .
from the medical standpoint , of course , you can tell that my legs , the most powerful for the most powerful , is to be a little bit of titan , and artificial , and artificial , for aging , to make it , really , to be
so maybe this technological change is clear because the one that there was always a different truth , which is that every person of society is something very much more powerful and very powerful and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt to our biggest plus
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story because people always ask me about how to deal with a chance and i &apos;m going to tell you something : this sentence has never been a lot of time to answer , and i think i &apos;m
this sentence from the way that we live with a chance of thinking that success or happiness depends on a challenge , without being shaped by that , and when my life would be so successful , because i could get the possible one to be a prosthetic ,
but the truth is that we change . of course we &apos;re shaped by the challenge , whether they &apos;re physically , emotionally or even both both is both both .
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s good .
so , it &apos;s not an obstacle that we need to do to get better to get better to our lives .
so , it &apos;s just to be able to be able to live in our lives .
and i tend to see that as my shadow .
sometimes i realize he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s barely seeing , but he &apos;s constantly at me .
and i don &apos;t want to do that , and i &apos;m not going to do the impact of a human being .
there are a life in life , and challenges , and they &apos;re just a real and every person &apos;s real , and every person is not going to be different , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to come to the way that we &apos;re
so we &apos;re not just responsible for people that we love to preserve , but they also prepare to get good with it .
and we don &apos;t like our kids , if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt to it .
you have to separate two things : to be the medical fact , to be the most powerful , and to the other , the social opinion of whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and permanent disability that i had to put apart is that the world is constantly meant to describe it with these definitions .
in our desire , people who are on the heart , and they &apos;re going to tell them the cold , hard truth about their medical , or even a forecast to the quality of life that they expect to be able to do , we don &apos;t have
maybe this is the concept of the concept that &apos;s just looking at what &apos;s going on in a broken , and how we fix that , for every single one of the major disability than the treatment of the treatment .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being , and not all its forces and possibilities , and we can see , we can do that in addition to the natural struggle that you might have to lead to , another disease .
we &apos;re going to have a human being that has a value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the most sophisticated and focus on all the area of human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between perception of our flaws and our great most powerful , a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t be able to put this challenge in the case , or deny , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , we should be able to get them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about realizing the odds of opportunity .
it may be more likely to ask that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome it , but that we &apos;re open to it , and they &apos;re going to hug them to put them on the most important , and maybe to go to the end of the
and maybe we can do it as a little natural , coherent and useful and useful , and don &apos;t feel so much as it &apos;s so much as a way of the presence .
in this year , we celebrate 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote 150 years ago , darwin has written , darwin , in my eyes , in something very true in human character .
i would be so used to this : not the most powerful of his kind of way , and not the most powerful of his way , but the ones that can adapt to the best .
in conflicts , creativity is coming .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people , and the ability to survive , is defined by the fight of human mind , to turn through conflict .
so again , change and adaptation are the great skills of people .
and maybe we know what wood we &apos;re cutting out , if we really have to be tested .
maybe that &apos;s the point of probability of the point of the sound , a sense of the most important , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like that .
we can give a new meaning to the way that it goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see more than change .
so , it &apos;s a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve done ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
so , who &apos;s frankly , who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical thing . but not the normal . and wouldn &apos;t you want to learn this poor , gray person really want to learn if it really would be ?
i think more , not .
it would be great if we &apos;re going to get this paradigm of normal against another one of the possibilities or the strength to even make it a little bit more dangerous , and we can invite the forces of very many children , and they invite them to
and the way that we &apos;ve found that we have a people from the members of our society always have a needed to be useful and to afford to do a contribution .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals have older people , and people with heavy physical injuries with heavy physical injuries , and maybe that was because the life life in the world &apos;s life was valuable to society .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went into town , in which i grew up in a computer factory in the middle of pennsylvania , and i was there in the northeast zone , and i was there a kind of tomatoes .
it was summer and i had a lot of time .
and i hear how a guy says , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to go and see this older man . i had no idea who he &apos;s .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you may hardly remember me .
when i first saw them , i got them out of their mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , so the .
and of course , it &apos;s done click .
this was dr. &apos;s favorite , a man i knew just from narratives of my mother , because of course , very typical , to my birthday , two weeks , to late .
the doctor for the chief committee of my mother was in vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world , not at all .
and because i was born without a more sophisticated , and my feet had been looking at them and i just had a few toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , he had the most bad news , that strangers had to get the
he said to me , &quot; i had to say your parents , you never would walk , and never would be like other kids , and you could never have a independent life , and you &apos;ve just been lying in the way that you have a independent
really , i found that he had collected my entire childhood , no matter whether i had won in a second class in the second grade , whether i was in the front grade with the most prolific , and he was going to be able to teach the
and he called this part of his course of his course , the x factor of the human willing .
you can &apos;t just emphasize enough , how critical this factor can be for the quality of life .
and dr. , he kept telling , he said , &quot; i learned that kids , if they don &apos;t always say anything else , and even if they get a little bit of support , they can achieve children , and then they can get a lot of
see , dr. &apos;s thinking has changed his thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone is dealing with two different things .
and i &apos;ve changed my thinking in the course of time when you asked me to have a little bit of the time of 15 years , if i had my prostheses against legs and bones , then i had no one of the second .
i was going to really work in normal .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not sure that .
and that &apos;s what happens because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not despite this experience .
and maybe this change could happen because i &apos;ve been looking at so many people who have opened my doors , rather than to meet people who were being constrained with me or a notion of a sense of a sense .
look , it really takes a human being to show you how you can decipher your forces , and you &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to turn their own , internal forces , the human mind is so much -- if you do that , and for someone in a critical moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher , then you &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to open doors .
the real meaning of the word &quot; the word &quot; is &quot; the word &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means something that is in a way that is the potential of the potential .
again , what potential do we want to do now ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the u.k. , a case of a case was done in the u.k. , and then the most popular in the &apos; 60s was transformed in the world .
they call this &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the students are divided to grades .
and the one student will be tested harder , and they get better teachers .
they &apos;ve been given to a little bit of students with a &quot; enough &quot; the grade , &quot; a &quot; good &quot; , and it was told you , they were very smart , they were very smart , and they really wrote it .
and of course , it breaks to hear the heart that the other thing was said , they &apos;re just enough .
and it was the same thing that was going to be the three months .
but only those who were still in school -- except from students who had the school .
so , in this study , the teachers were not the teachers .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
you just said that , the student and that they are the students with the grade , and they &apos;ve taught them something , and they &apos;re treated .
the only real disability is a broken mind , which was broken , has no hope , has no hope . he doesn &apos;t find any more of the natural , very , very , very much more powerful , and our collective ability of imagination .
but if we create it , the human spirit is going to help to hope , to hope , and other people around themselves , and to be beautiful , and then we &apos;re going to be able to be able to make our forces really positive .
if a mind has about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new design systems .
i want to end with a poem that was written by persian poet called the 14th century , and i told my friend jacques , and the poem is called &quot; the god , &quot; the god , the god , not the god , not the god ,
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right now ?
suppose i said , by a few changes of their genes , a better memory could have -- more precise , more precise and faster .
or you want to be more powerful , more force , more force .
do you want to become more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be longer to live in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who are always going to be in the more creativity .
what would you like to do most ?
what would you like to have if you could just have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about so many as it &apos;s creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you choose to be a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to say , as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a whole different world .
is that all the way that it &apos;s all the way ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a compelling topic here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor &apos;s issue .
the big geneticists in the 20th century , the most powerful , the most powerful , the russian in the russian of the russian church , wrote a paper called &quot; nothing in biology , &quot; and the title is not a sense of the science of evolution .
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time , you take your personal , you get your personal , and maybe you can take your personal , and maybe you can take
but if you accept biological evolution , you think about this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for other people &apos;s disease or it &apos;s also us ?
this is another view of life .
in this picture , i have a bush as a center of the branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the existing species of life have been success in evolutionary terms of the branches of these branches
the human part of this kind of thing , far at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in .
we &apos;re going to be a common ancestor of modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids were in hominids .
some are come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about the years of time .
it seems like we &apos;re right from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually the biggest part , the fundamental mechanisms are the same way of our cells .
is it clear that we can use it from that , and the mechanisms of a common bacterium can produce the protein of the human health system , which is used to treat the world &apos;s brain ?
this is not like a little bit of the time ; this is the same protein that &apos;s the same thing that comes from the pancreas .
and what we &apos;re talking about about bacteria is that everybody from us in our gut is more bacteria than it leads cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times a lot .
i mean , think of the , if antonio damasio asks her self , you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s wet , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re all going to give them all nutrients that you could just want to offer without effort .
it &apos;s really a lighter way to bacteria , with an algorithmic degree of unintended , and it &apos;s forced to end up to the end .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they &apos;re important for their lives .
they help the defining nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will be in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary balance in form of species ?
or are we going to be able to be something else -- something that may even be adapted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s go back to the big bang at the big bang 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago -- the first signs of living , maybe three to four billion years ago , maybe the first way
in this huge victorian symphony of the universe , life is just just a short time ; the animal kingdom , like a single one , and the human life , a small kind of light .
that &apos;s what we were .
this is also the most important thing that &apos;s going to be the talk that i &apos;m going to do , and i hope , d , you have to be able to be .
now , when i was a computer scientist on college , i had my first favorite .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in the power of evolution , and i asked , something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in the world , every cell , and all the genetic information of the cell will continue to be on both daughter &apos;s cell .
but at the time , when the organisms came out , things started to change .
sexual reproduction is going to be in the picture .
and very important , with the introduction of sexual reproduction that &apos;s going to be the genome , the rest of the body is going to be the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the most popular of death is going to be in the same moment of the same moment as the sexual reproduction .
now i have to say , if i was a computer company , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable to the point , but with every year , it &apos;s got to my increase .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns that was in las vegas in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat of his favorite .
he opens the door .
it &apos;s a beautiful way of doing a very crowded of the world .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for a computer company . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization of a doctor that i was a goal of the other thing that was the goal of evolution -- not necessarily , just different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to hold healthy .
i wanted to restore health for a disease .
i wanted to have a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the fda &apos;s hunt on the next generation , adaptation and survival generation .
from a evolutionary standpoint , they are and i &apos;ve developed as a lot of rockets to send the genetic energy in the next stage of orbit to go to the sea .
i think we would all be able to understand the mood that was brought to the phrase , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to replicate immortality through my work .
i want to reach it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest life .
it &apos;s not necessarily the largest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution is the creatures that are best to adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , and that &apos;s the hot steam survival , and that &apos;s the hot steam survival , if fish were there , they would have a vacuum , they would have a little bit of a sudden to make
so what does that mean when we look back at the back , what happens in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and especially as we &apos;re going to go forward to the next phase , i would say that there
the first is we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reasons that it would be , we &apos;ve been able to get the first one through medicine , and it &apos;s been able to get a lot of genes that would be otherwise more sophisticated and had been removed from the population .
and secondly , we have a species of our environment that we &apos;ve done , that we &apos;ve made it , that they &apos;re going to adapt to us , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and mix and mix and mix so much that it &apos;s not going to be more likely to say that isolation is necessary for evolution to be able to do it .
a second way is that it &apos;s a evolution of traditional way of being imposed by the forces of nature .
and the argument , here would be that the wheels of evolution slowly is moving up , but they &apos;re slowed down .
and so far the isolation is when we &apos;re exposed to a species of planets , it will be isolation and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a compelling , fascinating and scary opportunity .
i call it a little bit of the new development , which is not just , of course , but it &apos;s led to us as a more powerful thing , and we decided to do it as a more powerful thing that we do .
now , how could that happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s first look at reality that people today are making decisions about their offspring .
they &apos;re , in some cultures that choice , to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family are deciding .
so think of that if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to make genetic adaptations that are healing and prevent the disease .
what if you could do the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or the risk of risk or stroke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do it , to make these changes in their genes ?
if we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be more likely to be able to be able to be able to be able to do this kind of changes .
the human genome project started in 1990 and it took 13 years .
it cost a million dollars .
in the next year , when it was finished , they could do the same for 20 million dollars in the world &apos;s next year .
today , you can get a sequence of three billion base base of human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 and a half of a week .
it &apos;s not going to take long to the reality that it will be the 1,000 dollars of human genome , and it will be increasingly available for everybody .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering arnold , the prize prize for francis arnold and the most popular , two scientists who developed the natural process of evolution , to work faster and to lead to the proteins in a more efficient way -- which is
a few years ago , the scientists were given the scientists to be given to his research in the case he took a adult , a computer , and through the manipulation of only four genes that are just going to go back to a pluripotent stem cells --
these changes are in come .
the same technology that can produce the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses not only protection themselves , but also to the immunity against other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s a experimental study in gang with vaccine , which has been grown into the cells of a computer company .
can you imagine something good about tobacco ?
this is all reality today , and in the future , much more possible .
so , imagine two other things .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
what if you could change the sperm and the fresh egg , and the fresh egg to give your children a better chance to live for a better chance -- put diabetes , the risk of cancer , the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to be healthier children ?
and then the analytical technology that can make the same engine of science that can allow changes to prevent disease , could also allow us to adopt the better memory , and it &apos;s better memory .
why don &apos;t the most sophisticated of a ken &apos;s favorite , especially when you can expand it with the next generation of the world &apos;s next generation ?
why not the fast thing that you &apos;re going to do is to get it faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are going to be the most powerful .
and if we &apos;re on a place that we can pass on the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want to be transformed by the evolution of evolution to the design of evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that may require 100,000 years , and we can turn it into a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions with their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , to be involved .
do we use these decisions to form a society that is better , the more successful , the more friendly ?
or will we be selectively different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
will we form a society , and is it more robust , or more robust and fragmented ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to be facing .
and the deepest of all , are we ever able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom of master that we need to make that decisions ?
in the good way , in evil , and used to think of these decisions , these decisions are going to be on us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine now , a portable robot that gives you a little bit of the skills , or another , the most powerful , and go up to go up .
we call this robot , in berkeley , this robot .
they &apos;re not other than something that they put in the morning and give them extra strength and increase their speed and keep them on the speed of them , for example , their balance .
this is actually the real print of human and machine .
but not only that -- so they merge and connect them with the universe and other devices out there .
this is not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers , who carries about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the request that they should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- the 30 percent of them -- chronic , 30 percent of them .
so we thought we would take this challenge and create a design system that would help to deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to the moment -- or the human universal , the most universal of the world &apos;s favorite .
soldier : with the most powerful , i can carry 200 pounds of the field of the terrain , many hours long .
his flexible design allows it to be deep to living in the living , and they &apos;re highly agile movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then raise my strength and resilience .
we &apos;re as far as we think of our brain system , this new computer system in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s look at our view of the boat , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people in the world that are estimated in the wheelchair .
this is about a percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we often talk about very young people with spinal cord cord spinal cord , which in the height of their lives -- &apos; 20s , &apos; 30s , and the wheelchair was the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , whose number of people are constrained .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it comes to a computer company , or to other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since he &apos;s got to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in the area of mobility .
so let me introduce you to the point of amanda , which is a spinal cord , which was a spinal cord , which has suffered a spinal cord , which has been able to do it for the outcome , that she couldn &apos;t walk for 19 years
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our main system .
it has sensors .
his completely , completely , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very much of the sensors that are attached to your back .
here &apos;s also the most important thing that &apos;s the most important thing to do , and the most powerful thing is to be in your hips , as well as your own , which is moving forward in this pretty much , very natural gait .
i was 24 years old , and in a computer factory , as a computer company , as a computer company , as a computer company .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement below my own .
not long after that , a doctor in my hospital hospital and he said , &quot; amanda , you can never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s a steel of every single hope of my consciousness .
so , the design technology has been to learn to learn , to go back to the way to go back and drive , and actually drive the hands .
but nothing was invented , and i &apos;d go back to that , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet us and discuss them .
it &apos;s in our hands and we have the whole potential here to change life from future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for amanda , and all the boat , but for all .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m a head of the world &apos;s head of a nonprofit organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t get poverty , i &apos;m going to be a little bit of a baby &apos;s own , and i &apos;m going to be a volunteer of a volunteer of a volunteer .
now , in our city , in the volunteers , a computer company has to be supported by a very early , very early , to be a very early time to be able to get a lot of time .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer at the most popular , so i had quite good opportunities to get into the world .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the u.s. government and find what our tasks would be .
when i found the most powerful , he was just in a very serious conversation with the most serious days of their life , which was certainly one of the worst days of their life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she stood in the pavement and barefoot under a screen outside the mall , while her house was in flames .
the other volunteer , who was just coming to me -- call him a little bit of a little bit of the lady -- the first one was the first and was asked to go to the house and save the dog of the computer &apos;s house .
the dog ! i was lost .
there was some lawyer or a little bit of a lawyer , which is now for the rest of his life , who could tell people that he was in a computer house to save a living of a living , just because he was five seconds faster than
well , i was the next .
the most popular thing to me is to be .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go into the house .
you have to go up to the fire , and you have to get a few shoes on the fire . &quot;
i swear it .
now , not exactly what i hoped i &apos;d like , but i went to -- the stairs up , the hallway , the &quot; real &quot; , the real &quot; real &quot; that was going to be done with this at the moment that was quite done in
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey back to the bottom , where i met my nickname and the beloved dog .
we put our estimate outside to the top of the road , where , not surprising , his most attention to the more attention than my .
some weeks later , the most popular one was a letter of the computer &apos;s office , where they were going to be the brave use of their house .
one of all of the things that are very comfortable is , somebody had a few shoes , and somebody had a few shoes .
both in my profession at robin hood as well as a volunteer fireman , i &apos;m witness by generosity and kindness in the big scale , but i also see the charity and the most of the time .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look at this room , and people who have either been able to have a success of success , or they &apos;re going to be there , i want to offer a memory : wait not .
don &apos;t wait to do a difference in life in another way to get their first million .
if you have something to give you , you &apos;re now giving it .
they &apos;re going to use a park in a room , rooms , they &apos;re in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day , we will offer a chance to save life of a human being , but every day gives us the opportunity to change one .
so they put them ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno &apos;s : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of humanity &apos;s secret .
a place where women have the most powerful , with sex &apos; hello , and the game is determined -- where fun is a serious matter .
and no , it &apos;s not a lot of the time , or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their own .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the forest of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees with chimpanzees , our next living relatives .
that means we have a shared ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , which lived about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are known for their own .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of the human evolution in the history of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
while chimpanzees are going to be able to get a lot of fear , the most afraid of the female &apos;s female is led to the female female .
and that &apos;s what we really have , because that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to be done , because that leads to a very powerful society in the deadly violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known under the primates .
they live in the deep of the protected , and they &apos;re just hard to do it .
congo is a paradox -- a country extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the arena of a violent argument that has been given for decades and almost so many lives as the first world war .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction are also survival of the bonobos .
and the decline of the world &apos;s decline is that you can &apos;t even fill a stadium with the remaining bonobos -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a little laugh that the trees are upset .
who are these related ?
we know you as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; because they have a little bit of the time , and they have sex , and they have the same sex , and rules , and social design and social design .
i &apos;m not saying that this would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because life is from more than the dmca .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives long .
play doesn &apos;t just mean the way .
for us and it &apos;s a game , it &apos;s essential to connection and the care of tolerance .
we learn to trust and the rules of the game .
play is increasing creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the manufacturing of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of the behaviors .
and if you look at bonobos in play , you see the evolutionary origins of human health , dance and rituals .
play is the most popular , which is the most important thing we &apos;re doing .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique shots straight from the wild .
first of all , a computer company on the ground -- and i don &apos;t think about football .
so here we see a young female and males in a computer scanner .
look at what you do .
that could be the evolutionary origin of , &quot; she puts him on the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more likely to do it , right .
yes !
so , the other thing is , they &apos;re spreading both of bonobos as well as people .
and this video is really interesting because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the most powerful thing that you &apos;re doing with new elements in the game -- like the testicles -- and also how the game is going to be a
but the game is a computer game .
play is a computer , and it can take a lot of forms of which some of you are quiet , which some of you are quiet , and you might be curious .
and i want to show you , that &apos;s a young female , and she plays peaceful with water .
i think exactly how they play , sometimes , we &apos;re going to be in the same , and we &apos;re going to be in the limits of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s the playful curiosity that makes us study , and interact with it , and the unexpected wiring that we form are the real breeding of creativity .
this is just a little taste on the insights that bonobos give us in our past and present .
but they also also have a secret for our future , a future where we have to adapt to rising challenges , through greater creativity and more of cooperation .
the secret is that the game of the key is to these skills .
with other words , play is our main system .
to make us successful in a world , we have to play .
but will we make the best from our own world ?
play is not silly .
but essential .
for bonobos and people equally , life is not from teeth and claws alone .
just if it &apos;s barely appropriate , it may be a game on the top of the world .
and so , my favorite , let &apos;s hug this gift of evolution and play together , while we &apos;re doing creativity and the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , middle 1979 , at exactly the same day , in exactly the same moment , every one of the baby -- okay .
so two couples , every one of the baby , every one of the baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to use a lot of time to imagine the ones that are going to be the whole time , because if you &apos;re going to imagine the whole time , you won &apos;t listen to me .
imagine that just for a moment .
and in this scenario , they imagine that in a case that &apos;s a , the sperm is wearing an y , which is the x chromosome of the egg .
and in the other case , the sperm carries a x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the egg .
both of these are the ones , both fire .
we &apos;re going back to these people later .
in most of my activities , i have two minds .
under a hat , i &apos;m going to be with the story of anatomy .
i &apos;m a historian , and i study the case of how people with anatomy -- that human body , animal bodies -- like you have a body body , with the body of the body , like you thought about body .
the other hat i carried in my work is the activist , as a computer designer -- or , as i sometimes say , when a two-year-old lawyer -- from people who are patients , the patients of doctors .
in this case , i worked with people who have the social norms in question .
so , for example , i worked with people who are the most powerful twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with a lot of time -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often , i worked with the people who are the gender , and so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female , who have not the average male or female .
and as general as the word , we can use the word of the word .
and in many different forms , in many different forms .
i just give you a few examples of the possible guys , which are not the male or female standard .
in a case , you may have somebody with a computer company , and the most important gene of y is going to go to the most prolific , which we all have to have to grow up with the testicles .
and so the testicles are going to be testosterone in the middle stage .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to recognize testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t react to testosterone .
and that &apos;s called the &quot; you &apos;re called the &quot;
so much testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as a consequence , the body is going to be the typical female course .
if the child is born , it looks like a girl .
it &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as girls .
but it &apos;s mostly going to take the puberty and grow their breasts and grow them , but they don &apos;t get their period to get a little bit different to this , that there &apos;s something different .
and they make a few tests and find out that instead of the more , and the uterus , in fact , in fact , in fact , and they &apos;re a y chromosome , and they have an y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could think of this person for actually male , but that &apos;s not really .
women , like men , have something that is called a little bit of the time .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the main question of the place is that the other thing that &apos;s the relationship is that the relationship of the hormones are .
most women , as i -- i think , i think , is a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real favorite , but i think i &apos;m probably the typical -- most women like me are actually talking about in the very typical .
we produce the food system and we &apos;re talking to the in the field of disasters .
the consequence is that somebody like me actually has a brain that was exposed to more , as a woman who was born with testicles , and a computer company has been a little bit of a sudden .
so gender is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be distributed over the whole range of bandwidth .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a young boy , and he had a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived with his girlfriend , and he had just found that he
he had a extreme form of a natural form of natural design .
he has a lot of chromosome , and in the womb , his favorite was so active that they &apos;ve created a male , which is basically a male .
and as a consequence , his bleeding was a male male , his brain was exposed to the male male part of the world &apos;s office .
and when he was born , he saw like a boy -- no one was a little bit .
and only when he became 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he &apos;s in the inside of the world that the doctors found that he was in the inner female .
okay , just a quick example of a version of the world &apos;s .
some people with the chromosomes , they develop something called the most powerful , which is called the most powerful of the brain .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason kids with this kind of body -- it &apos;s a little bit more , or a little twins , it &apos;s a lot of the norm -- of surgeons often adapted to the norm , is not because it would be for their physical health of advantage
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why you &apos;re often done different species of surgical interventions is because they threaten our social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that a certain kind of a specific kind of identity is associated with a certain identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is going to be a female identity ; a black person is to be , is to have a african anatomy in terms of your story .
so we have this awful simple idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body that actually is something very different , confused us in terms of these kinds of things .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about the world &apos;s culture .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept of a little romantic concept .
now you can imagine how amazing it is , if kids are born , the two people are born in a body .
where i had been able to have most of the excitement in the last time , south african was the south african year , the south african world was asked by the world &apos;s office in berlin .
many journalists called me the question : &quot; what test are you going to tell us whether the young female female or male is ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s no test .
we know now that gender is complicated enough that we need to admit that nature is not going to be a line between male and female , or between male and female and female and female and female and female and female .
so we have a situation where , the further our science , we have to be able to be able to be more likely to say that these categories we had for stable islamist categories , which made very simple , very simple , very much more , more
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
it also is about race , which turns out as much more complicated than our most complicated thing has been approved .
we &apos;ve got to be in all sorts of things in the world .
we &apos;re going to push to the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what do we do with the fact that we just differ from a few of them through a few of them ?
while we continue to move our science further , we get increasingly into a zone of the pest , where we need to recognize that the most sophisticated categories we &apos;ve probably had too simple .
we see this in all sorts of areas of human life .
one of the areas that we see in the world &apos;s most powerful , in our culture today , are the fight of the world today , the fight of the beginning and the end of life .
we have hard conversations about what the point is a body to people , so that he &apos;s a different way of the more accurate life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors used to be never so hard to fight the question when someone was dead .
they &apos;ve just held a feather under the nose , and if they moved , they don &apos;t buried them yet .
if you don &apos;t move more , you &apos;ve buried them .
but today we are in a situation where we &apos;re taking people to take the organs and they want to put them together .
and as a result , we &apos;re going to be in the fight with the really difficult question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult way that we don &apos;t have so simple categories as we used to do .
now you might think that the whole thing is going to be a little bit happy from categories to me .
i &apos;m politically more more more more nuanced , i &apos;m going to be a little more unusual people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit it &apos;s nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , &quot; i think it &apos;s going to be a lot more insecure . &quot;
and it makes me a lot of a lot of the time to be able to do democracy .
so to tell you about this tension , i have to first get a lot of a fan of the fathers .
i know they were a lot of time , i know they were a lot of the time , but they were great .
i think they were so much so much and strong , and so radical , where they were doing that , i &apos;ve all been able to look at the most of the years of the day of the world &apos;s day , and it &apos;s not because of
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happening with the most powerful thing .
the fathers were the original way of my view of the original , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s .
what she was a concept of was a concept of a concept , and they were replacing it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you remember all of you , our fathers were going to be the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was actually in the bottom of a very precise concept of anatomy .
the masters of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of the most powerful .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who have political power , they should have the political power , because of the most powerful of the grandfather , for the father , to the son and so on .
the fathers of the fathers , and they were going to be able to get them through a new computer concept , and this concept said that all people were creating the same way .
they &apos;re going to be the field of the field and decided that the common ones are seeing the common , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they did that , because they were part of a kind of a system , in which two things together are in common .
democracy grew up , but the same time was growing the science .
if you look at the story of the fathers , it &apos;s clear that many of you were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a world &apos;s world .
they went away from explanations , and they were doing things like a supernatural concept of power , back where the transmission of a very high concept is based on the very very sophisticated concept of the statements .
they moved to a concept of concept .
and if you look at the independence , you &apos;re talking about nature and god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature .
they talk about nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , they made us a concept of the tides of the world &apos;s common common .
and so they have been prepared to really be prepared to be the future civil rights rights .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they &apos;ve done for us was great .
so what happened for years ?
for example , women who are going to be the right to the concept of the fathers that say that the concept of the fathers is more important than the dragline difference , and said , &quot; that we have a uterus and the most powerful , &quot; that
and women are successful .
next , the successful civil rights rights , where we saw people like the people who were going to be able to do it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the world &apos;s population , which says , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people are going to get different skin companies that are in the existing similarities of the other differences , again , successful .
we see the same thing at the same time .
of course , the problem is that , and we start looking at all the common similarities , we need to start asking questions why we &apos;re getting certain kinds of contributions .
well , mind , i want to sustain certain of the most sophisticated , and we see , in our culture .
i don &apos;t want to give you a fish for example , like a human being .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that five times that , that &apos;s the right , you should have sex to sex or to marry .
so there are some of these kinds of things that make sense for me , and that we think , i should keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re sense .
so , come back to these two creatures that have been the beginning of the talk to the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in 1979 at exactly the same day .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , three months , was born , so she was born at june in june 1980 .
henry , on the other side , is born for the most successful , so he was born at march .
only because of the fact that maria 3 months was born , they all get the whole rights of the same three months before , and they have a very , very , very , very , very , very much of the way to drink that .
henry has to wait to all this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of the birth of his birth .
we &apos;re still finding other oddities of what their rights are .
henry , because you think that he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the most powerful thing -- you take a male , you can get a male , and it &apos;s going to be moved to the one of the maria .
maria , but it can &apos;t look at all states that have the same thing that the henry in all states has , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
henry can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman today .
so we have these permanent boards in many ways , and we &apos;re a lot of the way that we have a lot of things .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is doing this progress in the area of anatomy that we have to get a point where we need to admit that democracy is based on anatomy , and that could
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , sometimes it feels like science is going to be autonomous .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture is a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; well , we need to pull a line somewhere , so we &apos;re going to pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people were going to be caught in a very strange position .
so for example , texas has decided to be a point that , a man means to marry that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and a woman means you have an y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested on their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story that i told you about the most popular thing .
if we look at the fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream of a solution . &quot;
he says we shouldn &apos;t be people for &quot; your skin color , but after the property of your character , &quot; and it &apos;s going to be beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you look at people because of their characters ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be able to get right in terms of people , because i have to admit that i know a series of golden , which is probably more likely to make benefits than some people i
i want to be a lot of light that i probably know some bright , which are the most powerful , more intelligent and more sophisticated decisions to meet their sexual relationships than some more powerful , which i know .
so how should we ask the question of the character of character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really difficult .
and part of me asks , what if the content was a little bit of a personality that would be in the future -- could be made by a motel ?
do we really want to go to this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really seems to think about the idea that the united states is in it , to make the minds of democracy .
in our sense of democracy , we &apos;ve done our thing right now , and i think we would make our thing good in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like the case of iran , where a man who feels sexually to other men , with death , is being punished because he &apos;s ready to put a more successful , which is the case he might stay alive .
states of this kind of way , we don &apos;t exist .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon i talked about a few years ago , who had a few of the twins who had a few of the twins with the way to separate them in part of a name .
but when i was with him , and he asked him why he made these interventions -- it was high surgeries -- was his answer that in his country , these kids would be very bad , and therefore he had to do it .
i said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve got political underground in a sense of the surgery instead of being able to separate them ? &quot;
the united states is an incredible opportunity to allow people to be the ones that they &apos;re , without the state of the state .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to close , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked very much about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibilities like democracy , or looked at the people , if we had more involved in the mothers .
and i want to say something that is radical for a feminist , and i think that there might be different kinds of insights that are going to be able to be able to be able to do different kinds of anatomy that are going to be a different
since years , because i was interested in the most interested , i also have interested in research in the field of the world &apos;s field .
and one of the things i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in ways to think about how they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from the study studies is that women , in average -- not every , but in average -- more complex , more complex social relationships and the care of people who are vulnerable within the group , very much attention .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i was a graduate student , one of my graduate students asked me to know my interest , which was my interest , and i looked at it as a feminist , so it &apos;s a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism female is . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about solving stereotypes about gender , so feminism is nothing female .
but the more i thought about his question , i thought that it could give a little female in feminism .
that &apos;s what it should be called , it could give something , in average , which is the female brains of male , which makes us more important for the more complex social relationships , and to worry about the most powerful .
so where the fathers were extremely clear to find out how individuals could be protected before the state , it &apos;s possible that if we &apos;re more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re more a concept of the concept of the concept , not just as you can
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go in the future when we &apos;re going to think democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual body , and thinking about the individual body .
so , if we try to make a more powerful connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a little bit of a sudden and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got in this , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with infrared .
i love to find a different kind of a different , crazy , crazy , and in recent times , and in recent times , and to photograph .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes from second hand on the ground , and in the field of time .
ooh , thank you .
and i &apos;m allowed to reduce the impact of my favorite , and also to reduce the impact of my own .
i meet all sorts of great people ; my dollar are usually serving a good purpose ; i see pretty unique ; and it &apos;s going to go shopping to my very personal , very personal .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i &apos;ve been doing in ted , and i &apos;m going to tell you what i &apos;ve been doing in ted .
i mean , what does someone do with so many of these things ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven of the underwear , and that &apos;s all .
and the same one week , all i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i have a mess that i would have all of the things i would have to wear , if i was going to palm up to palm springs .
and there &apos;s not me heard of me as the woman who &apos;s walking in ted in your underwear -- that &apos;s what i found a few things .
and i want to show you my 15-year-old for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m going to leave you some of the lessons that i think if you believe it or not , from these of these , not to wear anything new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the bright tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend much money to look great .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole thing , including the coat , has taken me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this whole week .
monday : color is a little bit powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiological impossible to be bad , if you carry your pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you pull other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation is completely empowered .
i spent a lot of time to try and try and do it , and i &apos;m going to adapt to myself at the same time .
are just , who you are .
if you surrounded yourself with the right people , they don &apos;t just understand it , they &apos;re also going to appreciate it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people say , i saw , when i &apos;m sleeping , i &apos;m going to be able to go to the games or i remember her granddaughter .
i &apos;d like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re going to see something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think that you &apos;re not going to look good at something , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize this for you .
if you believe that you &apos;re inside and the outside , you &apos;re a wonderful person , then there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to rock everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden , golden , to all .
and finally , saturday : a own unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world something about a word without having to say a word .
it was always proven to me and again , when in this week people were going to come to me , just because of what i was wearing . and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home , i &apos;ll give it all the time .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn to do this week is that it &apos;s okay to let .
i don &apos;t have to do that things , because the same thing is , it &apos;s always going to be a different crazy , more powerful , more powerful , and you &apos;re going to give it a different crazy , and you &apos;re going to be able
thank you very much .
thank you .
good day , all together .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as a flying , as flying .
this is what we call in our lab , and we call design design .
let me tell you a little bit about this .
now if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy grows with this picture in his room . but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is that it &apos;s a very interesting thing in the formula in the last decades .
some time ago , it was that if you wanted to win a formula one , you took her budget and put her money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now , you need , if you want to win a race , actually , something like this -- something that &apos;s going to be the car in real time , some thousand sensors that are going to pass information out of the car , and then they &apos;re
this would be , in the field of a , a computer company .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is made from two parts -- a piece of a part of a piece of a piece of a piece of a .
what &apos;s interesting today is the most interesting thing to be in our lives .
our cities were equipped in the last few years , just using networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to become computers in free .
and as a computer in free , they start to respond to other kinds of ways , and they &apos;re being seen and driven .
if we &apos;re developing cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
just by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population lives there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the most prolific -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
over the cities , all of this perceive , and drive in objects of everyday life .
this is from a exhibition that paola antonelli for moma later , during the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
now all our objects , our environment , start to talk to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every atom is out there to both , a sensor and a computer .
and that changes radically the interaction that we have in humans with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , when michelangelo shaped the moses , it &apos;s called the hammer , and he threw him on moses -- actually , you can still see a little bit of a place -- and said , &quot; well , &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; is the most
now , today , our environment starts to be the first time to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with the perceive .
now the first project i want to introduce you to is in fact of one of the first our labs .
it was born four years ago in italy .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually a new way of using the network that was used on the world -- that &apos;s a computer -- and anonymous and a information of information that &apos;s going to be collected from this network to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was the most italy that was gained .
some of you will remember it was a italy , and then the end of the world was playing , and then the end of the day , the most popular .
and no matter , italy won at the end .
now , you see what happened in this day , just watching the activity , which is happening in the network .
here you see the city .
you see the most powerful , the flow of the flow .
on the morning , the game .
you see the timeline .
and in the last afternoon , people here and there , the calls are making and moving .
the game starts -- silence .
france makes a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
and they &apos;re moving to the people who make a short call , go on toilet .
second , the normal thing . the normal thing .
first extension , second .
and in a moment of the most popular , in a moment of the world &apos;s office .
italy wins . yeah .
now , in this night , all of the center in the center went to celebrate .
they saw the big key .
the next day , all the center of the center , and the prime minister to make the same time .
and then all the down .
you see the picture of the space of the space , where , since the roman time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the key thing on the end of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today , a kind of way we couldn &apos;t have it in a few years ago .
and even a different example of feeling : here &apos;s not about people , but to do things that we use and consume .
now , we know all of this , where our things come .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that are a mac computer , like they came together .
but we just know about where things go .
so we actually designed some little markers in this project , and we actually designed a few little markers in the garbage , and it &apos;s going through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that we have , something more than a year , in seattle , which they &apos;re doing -- different kinds of things that you can see -- different kinds of things that you can see in the way that you can throw away
then we have the little chips that are small brands , the little brands , and they started to track it .
here &apos;s the results we &apos;re going to have right now .
from seattle ...
after a week .
and we realized that there &apos;s a lot of the way that we have a lot of the system in the system .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but this is a lot of the way that we do a lot of the things that are more complicated and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we throw away , it &apos;s not just going to go down to the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we &apos;re still going to throw out every day is still there .
and if we show the people , then we can push a behavior change .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague on the mit , the most powerful , could you even see more about the perceive and the many of the other wonderful things that you can do with you , but i want to talk to you about the second part of our environment , which
and the first project is something that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in the world &apos;s field of spain .
it started with a question of the village club , which came to us and said that spain and the most beautiful tradition , and the most powerful tradition of water as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology with it ?
and one of the ideas that were measured with a in a computer factory was , imagine that these tubes , and valves , the building , work , work , and close .
they &apos;re going to make something like a computer company with water .
if these are the most sophisticated , you can write it , you can write patterns , images , text .
and you can get to him , and he &apos;s going to open up to let them go to the picture of the picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of the mayor .
it &apos;s very like it .
and we got the mission to design a building in the entrance of the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was from water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you &apos;re approaching it , it &apos;s open and you &apos;re going to go into it .
the roof was covered with water .
and if it &apos;s a rubber , if you want to reduce the syringes , you can even leave the roof down .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture is going to be like in this case , you know , this days , if you get the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building .
no , they don &apos;t have the building , it &apos;s just that architecture is almost disappears .
here you see the building works .
you see the person who asks what happens inside .
and here you see me when i tried to test the sensors that opened the water , not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what a night happened when everybody stopped working .
but actually , it was a greater fun time .
all children from the building came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
not longer a building that would open up to make it , but a building that still breaks down and holes in the water had to jump to the water , and you had to jump to the water .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we think about how people are using things that we &apos;re designing .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beautiful thing to create things that are used and interact with people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical , the most powerful , the water of water and the projections .
and this is what we did about this project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine that these are really going to start to fly .
imagine , you could have little helicopter who fly through the air , and everybody from you with a little bit of light with a little bit of light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the ones they saw earlier , completely in synchrony , completely in synchrony .
you can have these cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or irregular but in three dimensions that change what changes the light is not the position of the brain .
you can play with different kinds of things .
imagine the screen could be just in different ways or sizes , in different ways .
but then the whole thing could be a 3d cloud from the world that you can go to , and you can move through the way you can move out of many , many directions .
here you see a real computer company that &apos;s going to be a very , very much of a day of the day .
if you turn the light off , it looks like this . so as we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of people are being run .
it could have a impulse to have a impulse that comes from people from the movements of people or something .
i want to show you something here .
we &apos;ve worked with a lot of the best dancer , one of the best dancer of our time -- the most important theater in new york , and the scale in milan -- we &apos;ve taken his movements in 3d to use it as a impulse for the
here you &apos;re going to dance .
on the left , you see the most powerful , the different of the other of the people &apos;s sensations .
it &apos;s a very , a little bit of a time , and a computer system .
so that they can feel the whole movement .
you can do this all the time .
but then , if we all have the most sophisticated , you can play with color and the color of gravity and play .
we want to use this as a possible impulse for the most powerful .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
the idea is , imagine that we &apos;re going to put the people in the people who are doing something to do something and change the environment -- almost as much as we call it , the way we call it a little bit of a time , but
imagine that every one of the little donation can give a little donation for a computer company .
i think that the remarkable thing that the last few years of the last few years is that we &apos;re changing from a physical world .
this has been digitized all that , knowledge , and it &apos;s accessible to the internet .
now , we can first -- and the campaign obama has shown that -- we can do that from the digital world , from the digital forces of the networks of the network of the world .
that can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is what &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can be to put us the next challenges -- think of climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we change the digital world to the physical world .
so the idea is that we actually put people together with the people that they do together , collective .
the cloud is again a cloud of the cloud of the same , which is the same thing as a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of the cloud .
it &apos;s a physical form in london , but with a lot of time .
you can move in the inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments for the most important moments of the 2012 and the most important , and it &apos;s like the connection to the community .
so both the physical cloud in heaven and something that you can go to the top of the top , like london &apos;s new mountain .
you can go in .
and a kind of digital hype in the night -- but as a new way of the experience of all the experience , the way to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important to the context .
and i &apos;m trying to express that people are not separated by nature , and that everything is connected to each other .
the first time i was in antarctica almost 10 years ago in antarctica , where i saw my first classmates .
i was in awe .
my heart was going to be a little bit of my heart , while i tried to think about what was going on .
the elder around me almost 60 feet from the water , and i could only wonder that this was a snowflake on a different snowflake year year , year .
and i &apos;m born as a calf , and by a glacier , and by the way , they &apos;re going to break out of a glacier .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they interact in clear ways with their environment and their experiences .
some of them are concerned and they &apos;re going to be able to get to the bitter end , while others don &apos;t get more and more dramatic passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think you &apos;re isolated , separated and alone , as we often see people .
but the truth is far away from it .
while a iceberg melts , i &apos;m going to be a little bit of the atmosphere .
while the iceberg is melting , he &apos;s going to get water free , which is a lot of life pumps .
i &apos;m going to go to my footage that i &apos;m going to do as if i was making portraits of my ancestors , in consciousness that they exist in these individual moments of these ways , and never will be so much .
it &apos;s not death if you melt ; it &apos;s not a end , but it &apos;s a little bit of your life cycle along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the world &apos;s office that i &apos;m very young -- some thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is a iceberg that i have in the ted lab in greenland .
very rare , you actually witness a kind of a iceberg .
here you see it .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg and where he &apos;s on the top of the iceberg .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man &apos;s there .
this is the average size of a computer system .
he &apos;s going to get about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just so , show you the iceberg a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really blessed by the work of some amazing projects .
but at the coolest , what i &apos;ve ever been working on was this guy .
his name is a little bit of a sudden .
and the one of the leading graffiti of the 1980s was the &apos; 80s .
then , one day , he came back from walking and said , &quot; dad , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the outbreak .
and now , it &apos;s completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood up with him .
i have a company that makes design and animations , so , graffiti is inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the art art and watch .
so we decided , tony -- and he &apos;s going to support -- and he &apos;s going to support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and his brother , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
i just want to go back to him and i said , &quot; wait , is that not -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all be paralyzed with this devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , just if you heard about higher , and a remarkable insurance can do it , you can really do that .
normal people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
does anybody see the movie &quot; butterfly and &quot; the &quot; butterfly &quot; ?
so they communicate -- they &apos;re running along their fingers .
i was amazed , &quot; very , very , very , very , very , very , very much like that ? &quot;
so i came to the need , just just a check , and instead , i put a check from that i didn &apos;t have the smallest idea of how i should be able to get him to the smallest .
i was willing to go to place and i was going to the brother and his father -- &quot; well , my proposal is like , &quot; tony is going to talk , &quot; and we &apos;ll get a way to get it back to the art , and
because it &apos;s a farce that somebody who &apos;s all wearing it in the way it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i talked to some months later at a conference .
i met these people from the computer , graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on each surface , and then draw with a light of a light that only recognizes the negative surface .
so they &apos;re going to go around and make them like this .
they say that all things that are going on up there is a life cycle .
it starts with the organs , then the most powerful , after the most , and the people are actually doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentations .
so i went home and ate with my wife and told her about everything and we thought , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology , you should be able to control things , that it could be a laser , that it could be
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and much , we have a few things , we &apos;ve achieved some things .
first , we have the insurance insurance the doors , and actually have a device for the device that he can communicate with -- a stephen &apos;s favorite .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him a little bit of a time , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and think , &quot; i &apos;m so much as a guy , this guy &apos;s incredible . &quot;
and we also have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my kids and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and programmers and the programmers and the baby and the friends and the house and the house .
many of our friends thought we were beautiful to do that and we were going to be a lot of the images and all the images on the walls .
but for about two weeks , we &apos;ve been programmed to be able to go to the world &apos;s office in venice , my children were involved , my dog also , and we created this .
it &apos;s called the design and you can see the description .
this is a cheap priesthood that we bought on the top of venice , something more powerful and a few things from the hardware store and the most powerful .
we took a computer company , they have a set of them , they put them on a led , and now we have a device that &apos;s free -- you can build it , we can make the code free , we can make the code free .
so we have created a device that is completely free from constraints .
no insurance can be able to get a lot of insurance .
no hospital .
every paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of two weeks , we went back into the room in the room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s the room of someone else and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all of these things that are the big unveiling .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of a year , and the two weeks , and the day , tony , and then , was to go back to seven years after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life life , and he looks beyond his life life .
we have a bed , so it can see it outside .
we set up a deck of a wall of the hospital , the hospital of the hospital .
and he drew again to the first time in the world &apos;s first time , and friends -- and you can just imagine what a sense of a lot of the parking parking was on the parking parking .
so , we had to go in the parking parking parking , so we felt that we were going to work as a part of the world &apos;s brain .
at the end , he sent us an email with the subject , &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve been drawn something .
i have the feeling , i was going to put it under water and finally , someone went down and raised my head , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
this is something like our favorite system .
that &apos;s what we keep on the shelf and we continue to develop .
and we have to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a very amazing thing .
and somebody who has such an artistic potential , it deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re in finding , and we &apos;re doing it better , faster and stronger .
since this time we have all kinds of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one &apos;s made of us .
it &apos;s all from our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong &apos;s about us and then , december , has honored us , as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
the most important thing about this is -- and that &apos;s the whole circle -- that this april , in the middle of the city , will give a show in the inner city of los angeles , called &quot; kind of the world &apos;s favorite &quot; .
and there &apos;s probably the hardest representative of the most difficult , the most difficult representative of the world &apos;s present -- the most powerful , the most powerful , the guys , all these guys are going to be there .
and the part of the show is going to be part of the show , which is pretty wild .
so basically , i &apos;m going to say , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , it can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the most powerful , the most important thing , was impossible .
do it possible -- all of you here .
i &apos;m not a programmer and i had never had anything to do with a little bit of a time , but i just have a little bit of a little bit of a sudden , and i &apos;ve been surrounded with amazing people so that we could put
and this question should be , and that &apos;s what everybody &apos;s thinking about , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing , which is going to be done , and if not , when not , when not , when not , when not , and when i
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably american most of the time .
and i &apos;m always saying that i don &apos;t want to get a scientist like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody ever voted farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and the humanities .
well , a epiphany is usually something that you find because you &apos;re going to drop it somewhere .
you &apos;re going to go to the block and it &apos;s a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard &apos;s .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle i want to tell you today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at the high school in the &apos; 60s , ohio , where i was the most popular .
i was the one who was beaten in the most green green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using me the toilet in the prison room .
it did it .
they did three years .
and i had to get away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it proposed to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then i found it in the &apos; 80s , and i found it important to the &apos; 80s .
about three or four years ago , i received a call in the middle of this teacher , woman post , &quot; i have to see it .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other as adults .
you can get to ohio , and please come together with the man i know that you &apos;ve found it now .
and i should mention that i have a little bit of a sudden , and i want you to be a little bit more . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we saw them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew they &apos;d have to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we took them , and we took them to them , and we gave them eight , because it was necessary , because it was necessary , it was necessary .
it was something that we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to learn me as adults , i was able to put it in a box , and she was put in my hands in my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation of that i &apos;ve talked about .
the revelation is a part of the life , which is a part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that needs the rest of life .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is so often mentioned here .
he takes just -- he would need , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to give us these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , while you go up on 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a engine that the canary , cuba , cuba , cuba , cuba , cuba , cuba .
that sounds a lot of fear .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat on the street .
i was the only one who could talk to the most popular .
so i saw her right , and she said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had been turned out and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot made the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s usually not the route .
he turns out the engines .
imagine a little bit of a plane .
and then he said three words -- the most popular words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; the way to get the movement . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk more about the most powerful .
i could see it in your eyes because it was horror , life was to end .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything else is different .
we have this kind of thing that we have , we have these things that we want to do in life and i thought of all the people i wanted to make a hand and not did , all the fences i wanted to fix , all the fences
while i was going to think about it later , a saying , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because if the wine is as far , and the person is there , then i open it up .
i never want to move anything in life .
and these urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned at this day -- and that was when we were the george washington bridge , so pretty much about the breathing -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing i really really do .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i &apos;m going to go to the way that i &apos;m going to be better in everything i &apos;m going to do .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve been given my ego .
and i was going to be able to waste the time i waste for the things that i mean for the things that are something that is something .
and i thought to the relationship with my wife , to people .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t discuss two years with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have more , right , i &apos;m going to be happy to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and during the inner clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 , &quot; &quot; aw , &quot; &quot; aw , &quot; &quot; aw , &quot; &quot;
you see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please flying into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want that thing to break out in 20 parts , like you know it from documentary .
while we were living , i had this feeling , human , to die , not terrifying .
almost as we were going to prepare our lives for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and these sadness really are in a thought , which is that i just wish one thing .
i wish i could see my kids growing up .
about a month after that , i went to a performance of my daughter -- first , not a lot of artistic talent ...
-- not yet .
and i &apos;m going to say , i &apos;m going to pause like a little kid .
and in the world , everything was made for me .
i realized that by the time , by being connected to the dots that it &apos;s just about being a great father .
more than anything else , everything else is my only goal in life , a good father .
i was the miracle of the wonder , that day , not dying .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , and back to life and live .
my call to all the people today are , is , imagine , the same thing happens on your flight -- don &apos;t -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
what would you do , which they put , because they think they were forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parents that you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the economist is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for the development of nuclear weapons is the most powerful in the world .
the gray boxes that you see here are the most powerful .
now , if we &apos;re going to do that , the systems that control the systems and the valves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with the world &apos;s brain ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we create it , a effective more effective thing to do on a laptop is used by a kind of a design box to get these gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind the adoption .
so we start with a computer company .
the most powerful thing is that the gray box is going to go down , the centrifuge and the iranian , the iranian , and the iranian , the mission .
this is a piece of light , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started to put our research six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was the sense and purpose of this kind of thing .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the most powerful part of the world &apos;s most powerful , and it made a lot of the way that it was made of a lot of the time , and it &apos;s a lot of
and it seemed something called a little bit of a little bit of a sudden , with these gray boxes , these kinds of things .
the living of our attention and we started a project project where we were infected with the environment with a writer , and we studied this building .
and then something funny happened .
and then , in fact , the way that we did a little bit of a sudden , the way that we didn &apos;t like the cheese -- it &apos;s not going to eat it , but didn &apos;t eat it .
that was not a sense of my eyes .
and after we were experimenting with different kinds of cheese , i went to that that this is a more important attack .
completely on a particular goal .
the most sophisticated , the most active box on the gray box , when a special configuration was discovered , even if the special program , which is trying to infected it on this goal .
and if not , then it &apos;s not going to do anything .
so , that was really my interest , and we started working with it , almost about the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , we say , a u.s. american power power , or a more powerful in germany .
so we should be better to figure out what the goal is .
so , the most powerful and the most powerful code , we found the most powerful code , and we found that it &apos;s in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a bigger .
and we also realized that they were very professional , from people who had obviously all the information information to available .
they knew all bits and the other bits they had to attack .
they even knew the most powerful of the most powerful .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve seen that the most powerful of the ted , and high-tech , you &apos;re telling me , the most powerful thing is , the most powerful thing is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this kind of thing .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
looks pretty much like old-fashioned design .
and i want to tell you how we were able to get smart from this code .
so after what we were looking at first , we were the first thing that we were looking at , because we know what these are doing .
and then we looked for the most powerful and we tried to get this with the real world in connection -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could show or prove .
so to make these theories , we call ourselves memory that it &apos;s definitely about the most powerful , it has to act to a high goal and probably probably is in iran because most infections were reported .
now , in this area , there &apos;s no several thousand targets .
basically , it &apos;s going to go out of the nuclear power system and on the most sophisticated .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all experts for swahili and power power of our client . &quot;
and i called them and they know their knowledge to compare their expertise to what we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital design of the world &apos;s brain in connection .
the rotor is that moving part of the centrifuge , these black object that you see .
and if you manipulate the speed of this kind of thing , you actually have the position to crack the rotor and finally , and even to explode the centrifuge .
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was actually , and it &apos;s going to happen and make it very , very obvious to try to get to the trial , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get out of it quickly .
the big digital design system -- we got a glimpse by looking at the very precisely data and we looked at it .
so for example , the number of things is going to be very , very much out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started to do scientific literature , and i started to get this centrifuge in the field of the world , and found that they &apos;re a handle in so-called the so-called , and every single one contains the mexican , and each of the things contains the mexican
so that made sense , it made it together .
and it was better .
these mexican in iran are divided in 15 so-called levels .
and guess what we found in the most sophisticated ?
a almost identical structure .
so again , that really fit together .
and this gave us great confidence for that , which we studied here .
well , you don &apos;t understand me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just like this .
these results were achieved by several weeks hard work .
and often we just ran into a dead and we had to collect us .
anyway , we found that both digital warheads in reality is actually on a and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little little bit of the time is a little bit of a time , and the landfill and the the big , and the big amount of energy is coming down with six of the things that are going on in interaction and manipulated valves .
so , in the big and all of us , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have what the goal is .
it &apos;s a lot of the time , and it &apos;s just a little bit more nuanced .
so we don &apos;t need to worry that other goals could be hit by the ted .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- i &apos;ve been able to get out of the socks .
there &apos;s the gray box down there , and you see the mexican box .
now , what this thing is doing is that it &apos;s the forces of sensors of sensors -- so for example , from the design of the brain and the most powerful , and it &apos;s available to the code of the code that &apos;s still going to attack
and in fact , this false forces are taken from the ted of the world before .
so it &apos;s exactly like in the brain , where the car car is fed up with the front of the car , which is fed up with the front of the car .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the idea of this is obviously not just the most powerful in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much dangerous and more sophisticated .
the idea is to be a digital design system .
we need digital design , where a human being can &apos;t react fast enough .
so in a power station , if the big amount of light is going to be fast , you have to open up in milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human being .
so , in this point , we need digital design .
and if the risk are , then really bad things can happen .
the power power can explode .
and neither the most powerful , the most important thing is that it &apos;s going to notice .
that &apos;s scary .
but it &apos;s still worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is a little bit more nuanced .
he doesn &apos;t have anything specifically to do with swahili , with a lot of the time .
so he would work exactly so well -- in a power station or a power station .
it &apos;s a lot of the time .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the predators -- you don &apos;t have to put the most powerful on a stick stick , like we saw it at the ted .
you could also use ordinary technology technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you &apos;ll finally get a weapon of mass weapon .
that &apos;s the consequence we need to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals are not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most sophisticated environments .
we need to ask the consequences and we &apos;re going to be able to prepare better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was reported very much of that , that people think that the most powerful thing is the most powerful thing behind .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you want to really know that ?
yeah . okay .
i think the most important thing is , the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind it is the most important superpower .
there &apos;s only one and that &apos;s the united states -- luckily , fortunately .
because otherwise our problem would even be bigger .
thank you , you know , you have a very jolly thing . thank you ralph .
i spent the last few years to place in situations that usually are very difficult and kind of dangerous .
i went to jail -- hard .
i worked in a computer factory -- dangerous .
i filmed in the field of time -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days of eating nothing as this -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
i actually have the biggest part of my career , and i &apos;m going to be exposed to terrible situations , and that &apos;s all just for trying to study social kong , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing , and hopefully , and hopefully a kind of
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world of the world &apos;s world , and i knew that i would make something a little bit different .
some of you may have heard that i had a display in a few weeks ago , a little bit of ebay .
i sent a few of the things that i had a few of the things , some of the things that i had , and i gave people the opportunity to get the most powerful in my tedtalk 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , and the most powerful , they got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson never will let me get that back -- the most important thing to do is not a lot of content , and not a
so what you got was , you know , your name here : my tedtalk , from which you don &apos;t know what the subject is going to be , and the you can actually fly to the content to fly the ears , especially if i put your
but it &apos;s a very good media opportunity to do it .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot of .
this is just the most important thing .
so despite this warning , i knew that somebody would buy the most popular .
if you asked me this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with confidence .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve been going to go in a few pretty terrible situations , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could be able to get me to something like this , and so dangerous as that guy in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is , a film about the design of the world &apos;s energy , marketing and advertising , where all the film is funded by the movie of the movie , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
so what &apos;s happening in &quot; the world &apos;s &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; is that everything , from top to the bottom , is completely , completely with brands -- from the beginning to the end
now this brand , the most popular stadium , the most powerful center ...
these people are being connected to the movie in eternity -- forever .
and so the film will study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , for always ?
i &apos;m a person &apos;s person .
that was more to the emphasis .
it was &quot; in eternity forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x as a more powerful , but we &apos;re going to be sure that we will sell every possible category in the movie .
so we might sell a shoe and it will be the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever carried ...
the greatest car that you ever have , from &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; drink , &quot; which you &apos;ve ever had , a attention of &quot;
so the idea is to show that brands are part of the life , actually , to bring them to the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of all film is transparency .
they &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of the world &apos;s movie .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy when i would help , and i would be able to do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny because i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how to be a people .
have you a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use perspective , because that &apos;s a negative of the world , but you know how to develop that ?
how much money is it required to realize ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth every case , some really familiar brands .
who knows if the movie comes out , maybe we may see a bunch of a little bit of a sudden .
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer is very likely to be very likely .
but is it a difficult thing for the movie or a difficult thing for me ?
jk : both .
so ... so , not so optimistic .
so , my gentleman , you can help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands .
yes .
if you look at people who they have to do it .
there are some places that we can apply to .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera &quot; would mean we wanted to lead a computer system .
it turns out it meant in reality , &quot; we want to do nothing with your film . &quot;
and just disappeared all these companies , one after the other .
no one wanted to do something with the movie .
i was amazed .
they wanted nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused because i thought that all the concept that was the idea of advertising , your product as many people as possible , is so many people like possible .
especially in the world today , in this interface of new and old media and the fragmented media media -- it &apos;s not the idea that the mass is going to be the message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a mistake , and that was that it was .
actually no , that was not the mistake at all .
that would have no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
look , if you &apos;re transparency at the most popular place , this is one of the first images that seems to be .
i really like your kind of , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free from deception and the most powerful , and it &apos;s just to detect , immediately , and it &apos;s a lot of the way that we &apos;re going to get out of the world , and the access to information ,
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a whole lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says it even our ceos say it .
but when it comes to it , it &apos;s going to change something .
but why ? well , transparency is a lot of fear -- like this strange bear , who still broke off .
it &apos;s a lot of the time -- like this strange highway .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is more risky ?
a whole dish is cool food .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to companies , and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
look , when i was a kid , and my father was caught in the lie -- and there he is sitting and looking at me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , it &apos;s three versions of the story .
there are your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there &apos;s just a company , a agency , to help us -- and that also , because i &apos;ve been familiar with john bond and richard , i &apos;ve been able to know that i had to do it alone , i had to go to the
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , a broad problem .
i have friends that make big , giant , giant , giant , and i have friends that make little pieces of things like me .
and my friends , the great , giant , giant , giant , is that the reason why their films are so successful , is that they &apos;re so successful .
and then my friends , the little little bit of the little little , &quot; well , how do we compete with these big , giant , giant , giant ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
so how exactly are we going to see the movie in the movie ?
whenever i do it on the way , and whenever i open the most open , you &apos;ll see the most prolific .
and every time i &apos;m going to say someone &apos;s going to say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
they &apos;re as far ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you calm .
so maybe you should be a little bit of this interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great things .
either &quot; the &quot; paradise fusion &quot; or a &quot; paradise &quot; , you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped with men as well as women -- find , or a stick , or a stick , whatever .
this is the most popular .
now i can answer all of your questions and give you a little bit of a little bit of a drug .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
so as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re as a brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so things like this -- you know , people remember to ban -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
what words would you describe ?
l-dopa is a lot of the time .
this is a great question .
and the technology technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone &apos;s doing under the blink .
we talk about bold , fresh .
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that these category really make something positive , unlike &quot; fight smell and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them more fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three times fresh .
these things have a more positive effect .
and that &apos;s a computer company .
what about me ? what about the most important ?
i have to talk to the man on the street that are like me , and i &apos;m going to be a little bit of the time .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like to really like beautiful clothes .
&apos; 80s , in the street , is the most important thing to do , except the most prolific .
well , what is the brand ?
unique .
i think the most important thing that i have , the style i have , is probably &quot; the glamour glamour . &quot;
i like many black colors , many of the most powerful and so a stuff .
but usually i have a computer company , like a race , or a jewelry and so a stuff .
if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classic priesthood .
man 2 : the brand i &apos;m , i would say , &quot; i would say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i would say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say
and part of a hippie , part of the , part of the , part of the world , i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the most popular .
i sell the entire country in the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex because i was a lot of the time .
man 5 : brand a brand called a brand .
is that going ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a computer company .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t be all the most sophisticated , but i often see the interface of the most of the glamour glamour and the fly .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed a experts .
i needed somebody who could go inside my head , someone who really could help me understand what you call the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot;
and so i found a company called the sidewalk &apos;s ambassador in the prison .
they have companies like a plastic company , and they helped the way that they have to discover these kinds of things .
if you could do it for the ones , they could also help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me just a little bit like that with your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who are making my worldview .
tell me about this world .
and the world , this world ? i think the world is the world that you live in -- how people around a around , the friends , the family , the way you live , the work and so .
all these things come and start from a place , and i &apos;m going to start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s next to you want to talk about .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is that the thought and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
tell me about &quot; why &quot; &quot; why &quot; -- what does it bring us ?
what &apos;s the most important thing ? what &apos;s the most important thing ?
why is it important , the most important thing ? what does the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little more about them , they &apos;re not .
what else do you have through ?
... that doesn &apos;t have to be fear . what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
and no , no , thank you .
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . well . okay .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be done .
there was quite a lot of crazy things .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their favorite , two separate , but the pages of the pages has a little bit of a brand , the morgan , a brand , a brand , a brand brand .
they &apos;re very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies are going to focus on a strength rather than both .
many companies tend to -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid them , they &apos;re afraid , they &apos;re afraid , they &apos;re afraid , and they &apos;re going to be welcome to themselves , and they &apos;re actually going to turn them into something positive
what other brands act like ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , target , wii , mini , mini , little of the mini and the most powerful .
now , there are some of these brands and the most exciting brands , these things that come and go , but a more powerful , a brand , a brand , is a pretty strong thing .
a computer company , a brand brand , like , is your brand ?
if someone would ask them to describe their favorite , their favorite , how would they be ?
you &apos;re a little bit of a design ? are you something that is going to bring blood into the brain ?
or are they more likely to do a more powerful ?
are you something that a little quiet , more conservative , conservative ?
and the things that are the most playful is things that are the playful , fresh , the way the most powerful , and the way that they were , they failed , and they were failing , and the kind of a little bit of the way that
or are they more like a more powerful ?
are you more respected and more powerful like a little bit of a time ?
are they established , traditionally , more , more powerful , compassionate , compassionate , and the oprah ?
are you reliable , stable , more safe , safe , is , holy , and the dalai lama , or the dalai lama ?
in the course of the movie , we had more than 500 companies , which were up and the &quot; no &quot; , and the &quot; no &quot; , because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they wanted nothing to do with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control about the finished product .
but , 17 , 17 , the ones that were willing to get to get to these control that were going to make somebody who wanted to do with somebody who would be able to tell them , and the playful , and then we finally have to tell
they &apos;re going to tell us the story of the world &apos;s history , like we tell the story that you &apos;re using the story today to be used to the brain , both of the brain &apos;s brain , both to make advertising as well as movies .
we drove to sao paulo where was banned to be banned .
in the entire city , for five years , there &apos;s no poster , no poster , no a threshold , nothing .
and we drove in school school , where companies are going to be their way to the way in the wild schools in the world .
the incredible for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback , or where i had the biggest success , these are where i was directly serious with things .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they &apos;re the middle of the middle , they &apos;re the agencies , and they said that the agencies may not really have their interest in sense .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people think that our view is challenges .
and how did it be for you ? what it was successful ?
now , there was the movie in the corporate film festival , we can see that .
according to the first time , the first thing was in january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million of these film .
that actually includes a period of two weeks of two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film was not going to be .
there &apos;s no time there . no one &apos;s a lot of a sudden .
it &apos;s not coming out of other countries .
now , finally , the film has reached a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every ad , with the one that we &apos;re talking about , the customers that are going to be the finger of it .
something i think is that if you arrest your chance , the risks that are going to be able to put risks in these risks .
i think if you keep people out of it , you &apos;ll get closer to failure .
i think if you trained your employees to avoid risks , you &apos;re prepared to get the whole company to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunities that maybe they might be more nuanced .
finally , in the process of the process , we should welcome fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
they welcome the fear . they welcome the risk .
and a big taste of the way we &apos;re welcome to the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , it brings us a little bit more honesty .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk &quot; is welcome to transparency , &quot; you &apos;ve been telling me about my good friends of the design of the day that would pay $ a $ , for the most responsible of ebay .
big data is transformed in the world in large opportunities .
and the so-called &quot; you &apos;re welcome transparency &quot;
thank you .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , what &apos;s happening right now with the $ $ dollars ?
this is a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , and i put on the most popular of the world &apos;s office , the most popular -- a check in the height of $ a little bit of a sudden to fund my favorite .
my name is a little bit of a name .
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i &apos;m going to do something with museums and art , and my favorite , which is also , i was the green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of the things that i can tell you about , and stories that can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and the access to it .
i grew up in india .
i was a great education , and i didn &apos;t have a great education -- but i didn &apos;t have a lot of museums and this art program .
when i went to visit , and this museums started to go to the way , i started learning a lot .
and while i worked for google , i tried to do this desire -- art to make it available -- to lead technology together .
we then put a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and you &apos;ll tell some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you &apos;re just going to be too much .
you can look around all these museums here .
there &apos;s the most salient , moma , the most prolific , the van gogh , the van gogh .
i even come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of kind of new york .
you come in two ways -- very simple .
and the most powerful , and it &apos;s in this museum , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and you &apos;re going to be a lot of sudden .
you want to be able to put yourself in the museum ?
open the map , and jump with a click .
they &apos;re in the end of the gangs , they want to go to the end of the gangs .
just further . much fun .
it &apos;s looking .
thank you , but the best comes .
so i &apos;m a little bit of my favorite , and i &apos;m in front of a little bit of a sudden , and i &apos;m in the met of a little bit of a sudden .
i see this cumulative .
if the museum has given us the picture , you click on it .
this is one of the images .
this is all the old-growth .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click that now .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve been doing with the so-called so-called the so-called &quot; the so-called &quot;
so this picture for example has about 10 billion of the world &apos;s way , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can really get very easily in and you can get it into it .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is optional .
but then you really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there &apos;s something about it .
and i thought , &quot; wait , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and i realized that these kids actually beat something .
i was doing a little bit of known with some known known in met , and actually found it out , which is a game called the &quot; a goose , &quot; which is a goose in the front of a stick .
apparently it was very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
and to really go close to the way you go to the car .
just to give you the point of the point , i &apos;m out of that , so you see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is , in a second .
let &apos;s jump fast to moma , again in new york .
another more powerful of me , the most powerful .
and in the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the brush ?
and what if you want to see how van gogh is going to create this masterpiece ?
you &apos;re going to go in . you can actually go into it .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my favorite , and i &apos;m really going to zoom on with the car .
this is a little bit of the time , probably never before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many other , but i &apos;m missing time .
this is really cool , it &apos;s called collections .
everybody from you , everybody -- right , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter , no role .
you can go and create your own museum online -- from all these images , you can put your own collection .
just just , you go in -- and i created this , it &apos;s called the power of the design of the world -- you can get a lot of the time .
this is the most popular , in the world &apos;s office .
you can put everything with comments , your friends , and so a conversation start about what you feel when you look at this masterpieces .
i think , finally , for me , the main thing that all the wonderful things are not coming from google .
they &apos;re not going to come from the museums .
i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was a experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to be in the digital medium of art , and they represent it online .
and the biggest question is , the most important question i &apos;m going to ask is , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a design system ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be split in two camps .
this is the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the most of the hemisphere , we could be able to show your brain .
for example , this one , that &apos;s all the same thing .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you be in the scale of this scale ?
some of us may have decided to have one of these extremes , but i think that most people in the audience , their brain looks like this -- with a high amount of water that &apos;s at the same time in both of the dishes .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both exclusive or something like that .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i see myself as one of the people , together with most of the other experimental , which requires a good fraction of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good percentage to actually do the experiments .
how do we develop these intuition ? well , we love playing with things .
so we go out and play it and then look like it &apos;s responding . and then we start developing our intuition .
basically , they do the same .
so one of the intuitions you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing is just going to be on a place .
i mean , it can sound strange about this , that one thing to the same time is to be at two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed them .
i remember seeing a kid at play on a computer factory .
he was a hint of a hint , and he was very good at it .
but i bet that it taught the play with the most valuable lesson , which is the great things you don &apos;t just let you go over , and that you &apos;re going to stay on a place .
and this is a great model of the world , so long they &apos;re not a more powerful thing .
it would be a terrible model for a computer company because they don &apos;t play with the same little particles , but with these little strange particles .
and if you play with your particles , you all find all sorts of weird things -- like you fly directly through walls , or that you can be at two different places .
and so they were writing all these observations , and they called them the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the physics of the physics , a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need to describe the big everyday objects around us .
this is not a intuition , and maybe i don &apos;t just like to play with particles .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
and i never saw them yet .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical side has not liked it .
because if all of these things are made of particles and all these particles of quantum mechanics , then not just the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that should not be so .
so i would be able to feel better with the whole thing when we could just show that everyday health is also the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a couple of years ago , just to do this .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see , which was in the most popular way .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
so here i &apos;m going to zoom up with something . we look at exactly here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal , and it &apos;s a little bit of a piece of metal , and it &apos;s about the edge of the edge .
so i made this thing on similar ways to do a computer , and i made a computer .
i went to a clean space with new design , and i was going to be a lot of the big devices for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last little , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a swimming pool of sand and the thing .
this thing has the ability to be the ability to be in the world &apos;s brain , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i &apos;ll do all sorts of weird things , but then other people go to the other , and i hear all of these things because i don &apos;t want to be able to do it , or
so quantum mechanics says that the objects are just feeling like that .
the fellow fellow for the world &apos;s fellow objects are not only people , but the light that seems to you and the wind that &apos;s going to be over you and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is acting , we had to get out of all the way out of the world .
and we did that .
we &apos;ve turned off the light , put it in a vacuum and the whole air , and it &apos;s almost to the same , and it &apos;s almost to the elevator , and it was a piece of metal , and it was a piece of metal ,
so we measured its movement .
we found that it really moves .
instead of just that it &apos;s just quiet there , it &apos;s a way of doing it , and the way it was about this -- like a little bit of a time , like a little bit of a time , and together , it &apos;s a little
in that we gave him a little push , we could get it to the same time , and not to vibrate -- something that allows only quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what really fantastic .
what does it mean for a object to the same time , and not to vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion atoms from the atoms are silent , and they &apos;re moving into the same time , and they move the same atoms on and down .
just to be a lot of the voices of the voices .
the rest of the time are they &apos;re the rest of the time .
that means that every atom is at the same time at two different places , which is the same piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
this was worth me for all this year in the clean space , because , check that , the most important between one single atom and this piece of metal is about as much as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at two different places , this piece of metal can be on two different places , why not it ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine , you would be at the same time at several places , how would it feel ?
how would you deal with consciousness that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we &apos;re going to get it out , the light of light and the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece of metal .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator actually are just a very unfair objects that are in a small space .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more behind it , it &apos;s more deeper .
it &apos;s that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are . and that &apos;s the profound and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be able to think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families think about where they want to live and work , they have given them to be a little bit of different cities , which are all in competition to be new residents .
now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries that don &apos;t even have a single city to be used to be called .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much worth more value than they cost .
so we could just just have the world with a very simple , maybe hundreds of new cities .
now , this may sound absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
but just exchange the building of apartments against the cities .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in homes , they &apos;ve already done this ; the other half , but not yet .
they could try to expand the capacity of the existing apartments .
but you know what you would be going to be there in these apartments and your environment , and the laws of the laws of the laws of the laws of the laws and the process of the world .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to keep all these big things .
but you could go to a completely new place , and you can build a completely new block of building , and it would be a building that is going to support it , and not to be able to do it .
so i proposed that governments create new surfaces that provide enough space for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
later , i found that , about the same time , the same time , and the challenge of an reform in a slave , have thought of an reform in a traumatic .
they knew that every year , about 70,000 times of their country , they &apos;d have to leave the country to be able to be able to make sure that these people could stay in their country and do exactly the same in the country , and they can
in this point , the most popular thing is to be told , &quot; what happens when we &apos;re going to get a little bit of the country in the country , what if we just have a message of the american embassy , a part of the canadian
in 2009 , in 2009 , under a severe computer company .
the next thing that &apos;s the next thing that &apos;s going to be , was to be able to get a shift in a shift , which is both innovation , and the program was promised .
he asked the most powerful to become his favorite .
in the meantime , i was going to be in tedglobal .
through improvement , and by studying consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter city on the essence of the city .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t be able to get existing energy .
we pay new technologies , but for progress , it needs technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that are going to be back to us .
in 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk .
again , it showed him a little bit of the time .
the two was called me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december in december of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , to be a lot more valuable than they cost .
and i used this chart to show how valuable is a place like new york , think about it , and think about that a surface in some cases per square meter of thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , on a place when there was a pause , and he said , &quot; paul , could we look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk asked in very simple form that a charter city is a place that &apos;s beginning to be the beginning of the country , a very , a lot of the laws that are going to be able to be able to make the laws that are
so , i was asked by the president of the fellow , who meant that we need to make this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way that we &apos;re going to get our country forward .
i was asked to get to the fourth and once , and once at the fourth , and fifth january , a talk .
so i thought about a more with facts , which has a graph like this , which has tried to illustrate that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it must be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city of the city , and the sketch is the new airport that was built in a relational .
and that airport has a surface of 100 of the city .
so i tried to convince the most powerful of that if you want to build a new city , you have to start with a field of at least 1,000 .
these are more than 250 thousand acres .
polite have all the most sophisticated .
the audience of the audience were very serious and paying attention .
the head of congress came up with the stage and said , &quot; professor &apos;s , i thank you for your talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the punch line that a new city gives people new possibilities .
there were the possibility of living in a city that would be in a hurry , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also is new opportunities for leaders with a .
the leaders of government in the world would depend on the help of the help , they could benefit from their own , which they &apos;re doing in the laws of the laws that they would do in the laws of the charter and they would support that every
and the realization of president , was that the faith of the very powerful thing i thought was a way to get the foreign investors to get the foreign investors and build this city for all the parties in the blink of a lot of years , which has
we &apos;re in a field .
this picture is from this place .
it &apos;s easy to put a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly after that , in january , in january , you have voted at congress for a change of the constitution to have a design of control that &apos;s been held for special design .
in a country that &apos;s just a intense crisis behind the congress , in congress , for these kinds of things , it was elected to a voice .
all parties , all the world &apos;s rights , they supported this .
and to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
at february february , it was approved to a voice with a voice .
immediately after that choice , between the 21st and the 24 february , a delegation of about 30 , the two places in the world , who were most interested in the business of the world &apos;s business .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new urban center that built in south korea , and that &apos;s a big time of the city of boston .
everything you can see on this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the defining .
the other place that was very interested in the urbanism is singapore .
it was built two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re basically thinking about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a computer company ; they &apos;re already looking at this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already working on a legal system that the most powerful , and it &apos;s going to be working on a external system .
a country already offered its top court to provide the top court , as a dish for the most powerful of the life of the system .
also , the most important thing , and the most important thing is very interested in .
they even bring funding with a .
one thing you know was already already , there &apos;s a lot of the time .
there are many businesses who would like to put in america , especially at a place with a free free , and there are many people who would like to live there .
in the world , there are 700 million people who say they want to live in a different place .
a million people leave latin america and travel in the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to be able to get their families to be able to get work to work sometimes , sometimes it &apos;s a single mothers who need to make money and they have to afford to do clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes children are even children trying to find their parents , which they &apos;re in some cases , in some cases , not seen anymore .
so what is it for a idea of thinking about it in a completely new city ?
or even more , in the world , or do you get to build hundreds of the world , or are it distributed around the world ?
so what is it for a idea to make that every family has a choice between several cities that are in competition to be new residents ?
this is an idea that is worth spreading .
my friends from the massacre asked me to say , thank you ted .
you know how many decisions you do at a typical day ?
you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve been doing a survey recently with 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that make a typical american one day is 70 .
and also , a study was made by ceos , which they saw a week for a week .
and these scientists just documented the different topics with those of these ceos , and how much time they spent decisions with the issues .
and they found that a average ceo of the week is busy working with the world &apos;s work .
each of these topics was from many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were hit within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions , they needed an hour or more of their time .
think of your own decisions .
you know how many decisions you meet in the nine minutes of category in the one hour ?
how good do you think they &apos;re the decisions to cope with it ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest most popular of our modern time , the most powerful thing .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;ll ask you some questions and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise them , because i &apos;m blind , just the hand if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i &apos;m going to ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , so my first question for today is , are you ready to hear something about the most important thing ?
thank you .
when i was a computer professor at stanford university , i went to this very very very very , very very , very very valid store .
it was a store that was called the most popular .
this business , it was almost like a computer company .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and oil and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different types of water -- and that was a time when we actually drink the most powerful .
i loved to go to this business ; but at a time i asked myself , well , how does it come to you ?
here &apos;s the olive gang .
they had about 75 different kinds of oil spills , including that , including the boxes that were in boxes , who came from a thousand years old .
so i decided to visit a leader , and i asked the head , &quot; works this model that you &apos;re going to offer the people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up on the top of tourists that came up every day and usually had their cameras .
we decided to make an experiment and we chose to do the experiment for our experiment .
here &apos;s your favorite gang .
they had different kinds of plastic types of plastic .
we put a little bit of a little bit of the construction on the entrance of business .
we have six different tastes there , or 24 different tastes , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i &apos;ve looked at the one of the things that are going on , and we &apos;ve looked at two things , and we &apos;re trying to
it &apos;s more people , if they were 24 , about 60 percent , when they were six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what the people were doing more , and we were going to buy the people more than a glass .
now we saw the opposite effect .
from the people who were standing in the way they were 24 , only three percent actually bought a glass .
from the people who were standing in the way they were six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of a glass .
now , if you calculate it , people bought six times more than a glass of the glass that they had six to choice when they had 24 to choice .
now , to decide not to buy glass , probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the most powerful thing is that the most powerful thing is that we &apos;re going to affect the very very sophisticated
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it &apos;s about our own best interests .
so the theme of the day : financial save .
i &apos;m going to describe you now a study that i &apos;m doing with a computer company , and i was doing a study of the design of the world , which we were doing to the decisions of the retirement of almost a million americans in the entire
and what we looked at was whether the number of the world &apos;s number of the world was possible , which was a kind of a kind of a kind of a chance that affects the probability of whether more for tomorrow is saving .
and we found that there was a relationship in fact .
so in these plans , we had about the way that people were offered anything between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund were offered that , in fact , the participation rate was lower .
now if you look at the extreme , the plans that were offered two fund , a more powerful in the 1970s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that almost 60 fund , the most likely to have been on about the most sophisticated percent of the world &apos;s population .
now , that even if you &apos;re going to participate in the way that you &apos;re going to participate , if more possibilities were to choice , even then it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , rather than the more possibilities they were available to , the more people were going to be able to pick it up and fund it .
the more possibilities to give them the more they were in pure the way they were in pure the way .
no one of these extreme decisions , to the decisions that someone would recommend , if we &apos;re important to their future financial well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential negative consequences that offer that to offer more and more choices with themselves .
they push the decision -- push them on , even if it &apos;s about their own best interest .
they &apos;re more worse , more worse , worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re going to decide more for things that they &apos;re happy to make themselves less , even if they make objective better .
the main reason that we might be enjoying this is that maybe we might enjoy this huge shelves full of the brain , mustard , oil and the most important , but we can &apos;t actually take the comparison and then make a little bit of the fantastic supply
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested on different kinds of different ways -- that you can just apply in your business .
first , just just .
they &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today , that less than more .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; just . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they lose the most important .
but in fact , we see it more and more , that if you &apos;re ready to be willing , and the irrelevant way of going to go to the way you &apos;re going to be , you &apos;re going to get the cost of sales , and you
as a result , and gamble and gamble , the different head of 26 , they experienced a rise of transportation to 10 percent , they experienced a rise of sales to 10 percent .
when the golden corporation corporation , her 10 , the worst sold to the worst , they experienced that the profit to cut the way to the one percent -- a result of both , the rise of sales and reducing the cost of the cost of the cost
you know , the average of the average , you give 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart gives you 100,000 products today .
but the main supermarket , the supermarket today , is the world &apos;s supermarket , and they &apos;re just offering them 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in doses .
now in the world of the world &apos;s world , i think one of the best examples that we &apos;ve been doing is , in the way , the best one that &apos;s been going on on the market , was something that david was very strong , it
every single harvard employees now take a little bit of a piece of a piece of time .
and that really wants to make a choice , 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to do it .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the staff is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if your employees don &apos;t get them to be able to do it , they can &apos;t do their customers . &quot;
now before we started today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to give everybody in this audience in the audience in the audience , to offer a vacation in the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read you to you .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read them and i ask them to clap , if they &apos;re willing to take gary &apos; service .
okay . everybody &apos;s ready to adopt gary &apos;s service .
are that all ?
well , let me show you something more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who is ready for this journey .
i think i may have heard more hands .
good .
the fact that you &apos;ve seen objective , the first time , had more information than the second time , but i would be able to guess that it was the second time that they felt real .
because the images had been feeling for them real .
what brings me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of the world &apos;s problem , it &apos;s the most powerful .
it &apos;s about people to understand the difference between possibilities , understanding what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that consequences have to be vivid and concrete .
why are people spending six to 30 percent more , if they use a credit or a credit card , as a car card ?
because it doesn &apos;t feel really , we feel really .
and it turns out that if you make it , something feels like it &apos;s a very good tool , so you &apos;re going to save people to save more .
so we have a study that i made with a study of the world , and i &apos;ve made a study with the people in the world , and we &apos;ve made a study with people in the world -- employees that have been working for the most of
and as this meeting , we &apos;ve got this meeting just like you always had , just we added a little bit .
the little thing we &apos;ve been doing was that we asked people to think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they were saving money .
in that we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation to 20 percent and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or a rise to the four percent of the amount that they were willing to pay for
the third technology : the third technology .
we can do better with more categories than more choices .
so , for example , this is a study that we &apos;ve done in a computer scanner .
it turns out that it &apos;s in the middle of the ocean , and down in the northeast area , the number between the different species of magazines to high plans has been to the magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines and you &apos;re going to show you 400 categories , and i &apos;m going to show you 400 magazines , and that in 20 categories , you think i &apos;ve given you more choices and a better more powerful than i had given
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different types of water .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; &quot; &quot; jazz &quot; .
if you think that the left display is the left , and the ad on the right is jazz , then they clap in the hands .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
if you think that the left is jazz , and that &apos;s the right side of the side , then you clap .
okay , some more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the left is jazz and the right on the right , but you know what ?
this is a very highly powerful thing .
the categories have to say something that &apos;s going to be a little bit of the choice .
and this problem , you often see , if you look at the long lists of all these fund .
who are you going to do with that ?
my fourth technology : premise for complexity .
it turns out we can deal with more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we have to increase the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s a german lifestyle that gives you the opportunity to be completely to the car .
they have to make 62 different decisions to make their car completely .
now , these decisions are different in the number of choices that they offer a decision .
and the car , the car , the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , the cracks -- four possibilities .
what i &apos;m doing now is , i change the order of the decisions .
half of the customers is going to be from the many possibilities , 56 , to the low possibilities , four , four , four .
the other half of the customers is coming from the low possibilities , four , to the 56 of the , many ways .
what am i looking at ?
how do they care about it .
if you &apos;re constantly using the most sophisticated thing in the decision , that means that they &apos;re being overwhelmed , and i &apos;m losing them .
what you find is that people who go from the many to the low of the low , and again , they choose the most important .
we lose them .
go from the little choice to the many , then they stay in .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i did is change the order of this information .
if i start with the simple start , i learn how i &apos;m going to do it .
even though the gear choose to pick me nothing about my preferences in the interior , it &apos;s still going to be a choose to choose .
it also puts me in excitement about the big product i &apos;m going to do , and i &apos;m ready to get to the interest of interest with interest .
let me summarize .
i told you about four techniques that the problem of the world &apos;s problem -- just -- will you get the surplus alternatives ; you &apos;re going to do it , you &apos;re going to be doing it real ; you can do it real ; we can do
each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe today is to help you to manage the possibilities -- good for them , you can use them for themselves , good for people who offer service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re going to pick up with choice .
and the more we choose to choose , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin &apos;s , and i &apos;m a youtube , and i &apos;m looking at youtube .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are going to spread , and then , why is that important .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , cairo -- when i was young , that &apos;s so infinitely difficult .
but the most important thing is that we can be very famous , or all our creative activities , in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to the next saturday .
but youtube is going to be uploaded more than 48 hours per minute .
again , it &apos;s just going to be a tiny percentage of the amount of percentage , and it &apos;s going to look at thousands and so on , and so on the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : the most unexpected , and the unexpected .
well , we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
whoa !
and the most powerful thing , the day !
last year , the video of this video was going to be a video that he had filmed in the national national national national national park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this chart shows how it looked at the video last summer for the first time .
actually , no viral video wanted to do a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing that as well when you &apos;re going to be a mountain mountain .
he had uploaded a lot of the time .
and this video was actually sent in january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jimmy &apos;s favorite .
jimmy &apos;s got the tweet , the video that was so popular at the end of the way .
because the like jimmy &apos;s thinking is new and interesting things , and show them a big audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday . get down down on friday . it &apos;s the most prolific of the day to the most violent , and it &apos;s a friday , friday , friday .
rebecca &apos;s &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was almost 200 million times .
this is what the graph looked like .
just like &quot; double &quot; seems to be the nothing that &apos;s done .
what &apos;s happening on this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also more important .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , the most powerful thing that it was about , many blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson was a first , the first one who made a joke on twitter .
and it &apos;s important that a individual or a group of a little bit of a time was taken to a big audience , and it &apos;s accelerated with a big audience .
then these community came from people who shared these big joke , and they started talking about it and to talk to them .
now there are 10,000 times of &quot; friday &quot; at youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a memorable for every single day .
unlike the most popular entertainment of the 20th century , the participation of the community is the way that we &apos;re going to get out of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or something new .
&quot; &quot; aw &quot; is animation and music in the field of music .
that &apos;s it , just simple .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
and if you hold that for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a more powerful one that was going to look at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats that look at this video .
it &apos;s important , creativity , which is in the most violent and geeks .
there were a lot of things .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole whole kind of a whole bit of the ground made out of a stupid joke that we can all participate in .
now we don &apos;t just find pleasure on something , we &apos;re doing it .
who could have it fit all this ?
who could have &quot; double &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; rebecca black &quot; ?
what would you have to write in which it &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of the time ?
in a world , in which every minute , two days of video , it can only be unique and unexpected , and unexpected , as the talks .
i &apos;m not going to be very interested in the , i was not very interested in the one friend , i should look at this great video , about a guy who &apos;s in new york against bicycles .
i got a ticket because i &apos;m not on the top of the world , but often there &apos;s disabilities that don &apos;t go to the top of the world .
there was completely surprising and mildred was , casey was funny idea , and his argument five million times looked at it .
this approach is true for everything we do creative .
and that &apos;s all about a big question .
what does that mean ?
the most powerful .
what does that mean ?
and the creative , creative , very unexpected , is the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture , to each access , and in the audience , it &apos;s very popular .
as i said , one of the most exciting stars -- justin bieber -- did his beginning at youtube .
nobody needs to give your ideas green light .
and today we &apos;re all feeling as owners of our culture culture .
and these are not the features of the old media and they also meet the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the connectedness between women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of this connectedness is in a four year-old girl , when they were about 30 years ago , and they were in a little boat , and they were going to
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s going to put together .
i want to tell you about some of the most popular .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life of the simple hope of oneness and freedom was combined in his home .
hold it on the most violent of the test of the eyes in the face of the eyes , like he must be told that his life had a single waste .
the words , so long his friends , now his friends , now .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forget me life .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the story was really trying to recruit us , but we were going to be gone .
the next piece of puzzle shows how a boat in the early world &apos;s early world &apos;s early is quiet .
my mother may be 18 , when her father died -- in a computer , in a very , very few girls , with two little girls .
for you , life had asked her a job : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that they could fail .
after a four year-old and a half of the time , a boat , a boat , is a boat , as a little bit of a boat .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear they had pirates , rape and death .
as most adults were wearing the boat , my mother was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of time .
in a computer company , my sister , and i would have to drink myself and my grandmother &apos;s grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the constant , the motor , the motor , the clapping of a wave on the bug , the vast and empty horizon .
i remember not the pirates that came to a lot of times , but from the most popular of men on our boat , or the chief of the engine , the six hours didn &apos;t want to start .
but i remember the lights of the world &apos;s lights , and the young man , who collapsed and died , was the end of the journey to a lot of it , and the taste of the first day , the first one of the men who gave
no apple has ever touched again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next thing is , from four women in three generations , that are building a new life .
we were going to put down in the north of the world , one of the class of the world &apos;s population , which is the population of the world &apos;s population .
unlike the most powerful , their existence was completely unknown to me , there was no a more unknown thing in the world .
the smell of the world &apos;s own came from the rest of the world .
and the most profound broken , the most common , were in the way that they were doing , they started to be able to do it .
my mother worked on farms , then in a line of a line in a computer factory , six days , double layers .
it somehow made the time to find english and the most powerful .
we were poor .
every dollar was given and became put in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to get rid of . mostly the new things that came out of the second hand .
two of the ancient ones for school , every one to cover holes in the other .
a computer company to the most powerful , because they had to get six years .
and there were rare , but the rare , &quot; and there &apos;s a little bit of the time , &quot; and there &apos;s a little bit of the time , &quot; asian , go home . &quot;
after home , where ?
something more powerful in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go from the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and i heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered on the boat from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until her nightmares came to me , so i could wake you up .
she opened a computer company , and then she was going to put a business and opened a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t have the change , angry and the children , and they were caught up , and they caught up with two worlds .
loans and sponsor were searching .
centers were built .
i lived in the prison room .
in one , i was the classic asian student , who asked the power of self .
in the other , i was involved in insecure life that wore the tragic scars of violence , the most painful and the isolation .
but so many of the years were going to help .
and because of this help , i was in my last year of the year of the year as a young boy &apos;s year .
and i was a very precise , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous , of the world &apos;s book , was now tan le , refugee and social activist that invited to the places that were invited to places that they never heard , and in homes whose existence could never have imagined .
i didn &apos;t know about the point of the point .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the most powerful .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the comfort of the life of a unknown , a grandmother , a mother and two daughters that are so eager to be so eager to do the stories of their day , and they were still in the same
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old as you had the boat , when we climb the boat .
no one was never a way .
&quot; do it just &quot; she said , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about the most popular and education , and the statements of the most powerful and the most powerful .
and the more open i was talking about , the more i should tell .
i met people in all the most sophisticated , so many of them did what they loved , lived on the limits of the possible .
and even though i had my degree , i realized that i couldn &apos;t get to a career in law .
there had to be another more powerful .
and i realized that it &apos;s okay to be a kind of a , a kind of a , a kind of a , new , new in the picture -- and not just okay , but something you have to be grateful , maybe a gift of the
because the kind of thing that &apos;s going to be like is that the beholder can lead to the beholder , so easily means that you &apos;re accepted the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve been enough to know enough from my favorite , to know that , the world , but not as you do it .
possibilities that didn &apos;t have been allowed to be encouraged .
there was a energy , a very powerful optimism , a strange soup of humility and the most prolific .
so i followed my gut gut .
i collected a little team of people around me , for the category of the cell , &quot; not a challenge . &quot;
a year , we didn &apos;t have a cent .
at the end of any of the tags , i cook a huge amount of soup that we shared .
we worked until late in the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant , and we managed to do the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull in the united states .
after just one journey there .
my gut gut again .
three months later , i moved and the adventure continued to go .
before i leave the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time where the social norm and the local of the most important person was the most important person .
life has not changed since centuries .
her father died briefly after her birth .
her mother moved her alone .
with 17 , she was the second woman of a foster student , whose mother suggested her .
without support of your husband , she was worried for a big , by bringing him to court and was in her own case , and a bigger big bang , as she won .
&quot; it &apos;s not &quot; turned out . &quot;
i just put a hotel room in sydney , when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the most popular and looked at it on the other side .
i knew they came to say to me .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in a buddhist temple , sat around their necks .
we told her stories and kidnapping her , that we were still in her .
to midnight midnight , the monk and said he must close the showers .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of your is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because they &apos;ve been holding them tomorrow today , &quot; he said .
&quot; they don &apos;t leave them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s going to be through women .
you see who we were and how life has shaped us , we can see that the men who might have come in our lives , would be in the way that they were in our lives .
the defeat would have been easy to be .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i think that &apos;s the boat .
who would ever wish one ?
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , in front of the way , before , before , before .
can i give you a bug in your life , which is courageous every wave , the most courageous , the brain , the very sharp , the motor , the vast horizon , which doesn &apos;t make anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this and you could make sure , i would do it .
and also , the mother &apos;s mother is here in the fourth or fifth series .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it photography at all ?
because of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t take with his camera .
yet , my interest started photography when i got my first digital digital , in age 15 years .
i combined it with my former preference for drawing , but it was a little different , because the camera was actually in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you squeeze on the trigger .
so for me , it seemed to be about the photography of the right time to be the right place .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts to start when the trigger is going to be .
photos like this : a construction site along a much more nuanced street .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and yet , it &apos;s a realistic level .
or photos like this -- dark and the same thing , but all of the common goal , and all of the things that are going to keep a realistic level .
if i say reality , i &apos;m going to be a little bit of a sudden .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but i want to look at it as if you could have that , on a photograph .
photos where you have to think of a short moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about the idea , a idea of the way .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or colors ?
is it about the light ?
what does the illusion create ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how they can be made in a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see you as a puzzle of reality where you take different pieces and put it together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect things here , which we can identify all of us in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , they can combine something that looks still a three-dimensional , and it might be a little bit more like it might exist .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so we &apos;re striving to make our brains , because our brain is not really going to make it sense .
and i see the same process in combine photos .
it &apos;s really about combine different realities .
so things that look realistic to look at a picture , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things that we don &apos;t think about in our daily lives .
but if we combine photographs , it really matters to think of it , because otherwise you just look at it .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a realistic outcome .
as you can see , it &apos;s not three special images .
but they can combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
secondly , they should have the same kind of same thing .
and these two images are going to meet these two demands -- from the same altitude , and the same thing .
third , it &apos;s not to be able to distinguish it , where the individual images start and end by connecting them to it .
it &apos;s impossible to say , how did the photo actually put together .
so by having color , contrast and light on the edges of the individual images , put out of the line , like the way that we can get the limits , and the way that we can see the boundaries of the different images and disorders , we
here &apos;s another example .
you may think that it &apos;s just a landscape , and the bottom part of the line was manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely composed of photos from different places .
i personally have a little bit of a place to create a place , and to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to take a compromise with the ideas in his head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to try to find them the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on a computer factory .
the bank comes from another place .
the most popular thing comes from a quarry .
and yes , i even have the house up on the island of red , to look at the swedish .
so to get a realistic outcome , it &apos;s going to be seen from me to planning .
i always start with a act , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s a little bit of a piece of a piece of work .
and then if you make good pictures , the result is pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
so , it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that we &apos;re limited is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic people fail .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking about our patients .
and one of the things we &apos;ve introduced in the most popular was a little bit of a time .
it &apos;s not particularly scientifically , you &apos;re not going to be a cup of coffee or tea , and the patients , families , families , &quot; how do it go ? &quot;
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all of the electronic people are failing , because we stopped listening .
this is my favorite , a very simple thing .
she has a button , / .
and every morning i jump on it .
and yes , i have a task , like you might recognize .
i have my job in 95 pounds .
it &apos;s just working , every time i jump on the scale , they &apos;re going to send my data to google health .
and there are also you from my favorite , and it can see where my favorite is , where my favorite is , and not just in the moment i &apos;m going to support or something like that , but also with a look at the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with this , i &apos;ve been talking about 4,000 of the people .
so every morning i jump on my favorite and the people talking to me before i sit in the car , &quot; to lunch , just a little bit of a little bit of a sudden , &quot; i &apos;m going to be a little bit of a little
but this is the most important thing that can happen because this is the pressure pressure , pressure , to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could be smoking .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and they get to play together , to play some kind of game to control their health better .
and the next week comes on the market .
it will give this little little bit of the time that you &apos;re going to go to a iphone or something like that .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure , send them to their doctor and share it for example , for example , for a little more than 100 dollars .
in this point , patients come into play . they can &apos;t only take control of the control , and they can be able to help us in health care , but can also help us help the challenges of health , and so on .
do ways to use that , and they start embracing them with this , to hug patients in the team .
and that can be done by these kinds of ways , but also by rotating .
and one of the things we did is i want to share with you with a quick video .
we all have the most sophisticated in our cars .
maybe in our mobile phones .
we know exactly where all the machines are around the world .
we know one , where all the stations are .
and clear , we can find a lot of time .
but where would the next thing that would be the next thing to help this patient ?
we have a lot of the time , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next life-saving was going to find in this moment .
so what did we do ? we did it in the netherlands .
we &apos;ve built a website , and a crowd asked , &quot; if you see a computer company , you share with us , where he &apos;s , when he &apos;s on , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed .
and over 10,000 , it was reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find apps for that .
and we &apos;ve created a computer system .
we &apos;ve developed an app for a design of the design , extended reality to find these kinds of things .
and if you &apos;re in a city like a city , and someone &apos;s falling , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks , you also get your own , to find the next more , the life of life .
and we don &apos;t just want to do this as a more powerful , as the product is called , but also , as a result of the product .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , about helping us to help ourselves how to behave in the world , to put these things around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and someone &apos;s falling , it &apos;s your own own own , or somebody else , you can find a more powerful thing .
the other thing we want to ask is that companies are going to help us the world &apos;s most important thing in the world .
these could be a lot of the time , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the most important thing is that the most important thing is to be on its place .
please help us and try and do it , and take health not just to improve it , but take your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the most popular .
and my little little bit of the time , that we want to force ourselves to make it .
... it &apos;s a little bit of a sense of the attention .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take it to be a fool .
now -- we can just skip this -- i &apos;m going to just skip the video ...
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
and it &apos;s ...
oh , my time is already over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year , and working in a environment that is so much , which is pretty much , what you &apos;re actually hate , we &apos;re going to work
the program is called code for america , and it &apos;s a little bit like the most powerful for geeks .
we choose some fellows , and we &apos;re going to do it with a little bit of a fellows .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them into the world .
and they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what you really do is to show what &apos;s possible today with technology .
so they meet al .
al is a computer &apos;s city in boston .
here it looks like he looks for a date , but what he really looks like is somebody who &apos;s going to be a little bit of it , if he &apos;s white , because he knows he &apos;s not very good in the most powerful , if he
how did he get to search in this particular way ?
we had a team last year of fellows in boston , and we had the code for america .
they were in february , and it &apos;s a lot of the last february .
and she realized that the city never free that fire .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik , noticed something else , and that was that the residents were free to free the sidewalks , right before these parts .
so he did what everybody would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire fire .
you &apos;re going to take it free to lift it , if it &apos;s going to be .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game game .
this is a humble little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of 21 apps that have written the fellows in the last year .
but she does something not other things .
it &apos;s moving out of it .
there &apos;s this guy in the world &apos;s office of the city , which has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but that the citizens are taking the citizens to adopt .
it &apos;s very important that these are the most important things that are going to be , but people steal batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to use the citizens to clean the citizens to the rest of the world .
and chicago just introduced them to the people who are the most powerful , if it &apos;s going to be .
we now know nine cities that plan to use this app .
and she has spread a lot of things , organic , of course .
if you know something about the most sophisticated , you know that it doesn &apos;t normally go .
the power of software takes a few years to be a few years .
we had a team that worked last year in boston , for three people , for three people , for three people .
it was a way to figure out the parents who are the right public schools for their children .
we &apos;ve been told that when it was going to go over the normal channels , it took over two years and had cost about two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not even nothing .
there &apos;s a project right now in california , which has cost the accumulation of two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spreading from the way that we have a shot of the ball of the government , the government &apos;s way to the institution of government .
it shows how the government could work better -- not more like a personal company , like many people think they should .
and not even like a computer company , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , that app is that they represents a new generation that the problem of government -- not as the problem of a computer institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good in the collective act with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to make things effective together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; there are hundreds of people all over the country , and they &apos;re going to write up and write every day in their own communities .
they don &apos;t give the government to give them .
they &apos;re dreadful frustrated with their , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they &apos;re going to fix them .
and these people know something that we lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s then when you all have your feelings about politics and the snake , and all the other things that we really upset about is government , in the core , in the words of tim o &apos; &quot; what we &apos;re doing in common . &quot;
today , a lot of people have given the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re going to change it , because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government finally came out of us -- the government , you know , &quot; we &apos;re going to do the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and how many people , i thought it was mostly about choosing people in office .
now , after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s especially in communities to go to the community .
this is the call for service and information .
you usually come out , if you &apos;re in your town , you &apos;re going to be in your town .
if you ever have the chance to work in your state call , how our fellow scott &apos;s being part of the program -- in fact , they &apos;re doing all of this -- you &apos;re going to see that people who call government because of many different problems
so scott gets this kind of thing .
he &apos;s typing &quot; the official database &quot; in the official database .
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the most powerful .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors into your house and play very sounds , and see if the livestock is going to be the livestock ? &quot;
and that worked . it &apos;s a little bit .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the most popular .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call .
it has an app , a computer , and a computer , called &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; .
we don &apos;t write this app .
this is the work very smart people in the office of &quot; new urban , &quot; in boston .
one day -- this is a real report -- this is in the way , &quot; the &quot; aw in my trash . can &apos;t say if you &apos;re dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scott was talking to human beings .
but on &quot; the &quot; s &quot; is all public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post we have was , &quot; i went over there , the trash of the house was behind the house .
and it &apos;s a lot of time ? yes . alive ?
it turned out the trash of the site . went home .
good night , cute , sweet . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . this is what digital is going to be the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how government is to be able to be in the blink .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i &apos;m not necessarily a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m going to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government was playing a central role .
they connected these two people .
and you could have connect them with government performance if these need to be , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if a neighbor helps the other , we &apos;re going to strengths our communities .
let &apos;s call the most powerful , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about that , that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that it &apos;s the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is choosing .
how often have we chosen a political leader -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we &apos;re going to be back and we expect the government to reflect our values and then not changed a lot ?
this is because the government is a farther ocean , and politics is the supreme most profound .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with these contempt .
but it &apos;s these contempt that we have , and we pay to be something that we &apos;re paying , something that works against us , something else , and then we &apos;re going to be ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want that institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real thing is happening .
we have to go to the machinery of government .
so the main thing has done it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned , which has written a very detailed report , which is a response to the most powerful , which is a response to the most powerful .
this is not politically active , which is active .
now , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we have to reach what we need to do without improving the institution that &apos;s in the name of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of government fundamentally , in a way that can actually reach something by making society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the internet internet , and the white internet is not so hard to do things together , you have to build the only systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up with the voice of granted .
they don &apos;t fight that battle we all fight , that , who can talk to you , they all can talk .
you can make your opinion , on every channel , and you do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the work of government .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be a fire fire , a supernova , a trash of a turn with a turn with a turn of a turn .
and sure , we would have this fire fire all the time , and many people do that .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers of government , and they &apos;re getting benefits to the plants .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all got here : if it &apos;s about the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us are going to be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually my role is to explain the people like wonderful the new technologies that are on the emergence , and i thought , because i &apos;m under friends , i would tell you what i really think , and i &apos;m going to try to see what &apos;s going
i &apos;m going to start to show you a single boring slide .
... you could just show the slide .
this is a slide i &apos;ve chosen from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but it &apos;s actually about the universal form .
this slide shows data of a analysis of us , compared to the performance of the power of the world &apos;s performance of the world &apos;s power .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like several other things we often find in our field , is a kind of a kind of a way to be on a computer curve .
with other words , every step here is a power in the world &apos;s brain .
and this is an novelty that we need to use this guy to the scale of the technology in the field of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the light back again .
something more much more , because i &apos;m going to draw something on paper here .
now , why do we draw graphs in technology on the technology of the way ?
the reason that i was going to draw it on a normal curve , where , let &apos;s say that this is the years , so the timeline of a kind of , and this is a kind of an educational rate of technology that i want to show
and then you see that .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , we &apos;ll say a little bit about a little bit of a time , and then it would be very irrational in the scale of a flat line .
but if something happens like this , this is changing the conditions .
so if the most quickly the way the most important progression would be like the most important progression , we could get a taxi in a taxi and we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
and there was never before the story of the world &apos;s history , these kinds of plastic growth , which is the scale of all the years exponentially .
the question i want to ask you is if you look at this exponential curves , you can &apos;t go to it forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is going to be done forever and so fast as well .
there are two options .
either it &apos;s going to be a classic , like here , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
this is about about .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think that &apos;s what happens in the way here .
it &apos;s really like that , and we &apos;re in the middle of the world in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition of the world , in a new way of the world .
so the question i want to ask , and i often think of myself , is like this new world , is that it &apos;s going to be the new world ?
what is this new state that &apos;s going to take the world slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing if you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was a the future in 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
and we &apos;re not going to go on as that .
so in other words , the future is doubling every year since i &apos;m on this world .
i think the reason is that we realize that anything is going on .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we know that it &apos;s just not going to make sense to try to look at 30 or 50 years in the future because everything is going to be so different that a simple one is going to be a simple deal of what we &apos;re doing now
now i want to talk about what that might be , this transition in that we &apos;re right now .
and to do this , i &apos;m going to talk to you about some other things that really don &apos;t have to do with technology or computers .
because i think that &apos;s really to understand that , we have to go back to a step and look at the thing on a longer meaningful .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at in the meaningful of life in the earth .
i think the big picture is making sense if you split it into some of the things .
so let &apos;s go back , and the number of years , the earth was a big , a big , a lot of the time , with many of them , and the earth &apos;s going to go to a lot of chemicals .
now , if you look at the way that chemicals were organized , then we have a pretty good picture about how they do the most powerful thing .
i also think there are theories that start to understand how everything started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about what &apos;s going on , which is that this time little oil oil oil is going to be the same of the
some of these oil spills were a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and grow them .
all the ones were , they started .
these little oil oil oil spills were the most primitive .
but these oil spills weren &apos;t about alive today , because every single one was just a little , shiny recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , the chemicals have been distributed to more sophisticated amounts of chemicals .
so every one of the things was a little different .
in fact , the g20 grew up , which had a growth of growth , faster than others and integrated more chemicals from the outside and shared faster .
so these are the ones that are going to survive longer and they &apos;re expanding in the extent .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , if these tags were a trick about abstraction .
in any way , which we don &apos;t really understand , these tags have learned the ability to make information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and that &apos;s in a certain chemical form that we call dna .
with other words , they have found in this kind of thing , evolutionary species , which allowed you to get the way that they were being stored , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is to store over the time of 2.5 billion years , in which they were born .
in fact , the recipe is for us , which is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same notation .
and that &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s used in the same letter and the same code .
we &apos;re as far as we can , just to the most important thing , even in this code .
and i have 100 of the white people who i &apos;m trying to keep out of the airports from the ground of the world .
in this , what i &apos;ve done is , i took this code -- the code is from normal letters , which we use to the end of the world -- and i wrote my business card on a piece of dna and have been written with 10 ^
so if someone wants a hundred million copies of my business company , i have enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody on this world , and it &apos;s right here .
i would have been in reality , and i &apos;d have written it on a virus , and i was going to put it in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna of dna was a more interesting step .
and the most important thing that these cells -- it made them happy for another billion years .
but then another one happened , very interesting , very interesting , where things were completely different , which is , they started communicating and exchange information , so communities from cells came out .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
this is why the reason to antibiotics is growing to antibiotics .
some bacteria have found how they can stay from penicillin and have written this information with other bacteria in the dna and now we have lots of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate each other .
this communication was now allowed to be the most important thing in the same boat , which was in a sense of the same boat .
so they either survived together , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all individuals were repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly and the evolution of evolution .
now the main thing is , where these communities are so close to the same , they decided to write the recipe for the whole community in a computer system .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at that point , we have the communities , communities of many of the most powerful things that are acting together as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a kind of such a social community .
we have many cells that are not going to be asked to be on itself .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started to develop that the level , which was the evolution that was happening , not longer the individual cell , but the whole thing that we call organism .
the next step is now within the communities .
the main thing started to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures which did nothing else than information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the most powerful , which has built these things .
they started to train specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and that &apos;s what information is doing .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
and there was a evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , a individual -- learning now happened within the world &apos;s time of a single organism , rather than this evolutionary period of time .
so a organism could learn to learn a certain fear of fear , because they liked bad and made it sick , the last time he ate them .
this could be happening within the lifespan of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years of thousands of years , because this information had to be learned by the individuals , which died because of these fear , that they were not there .
so the nervous system has the most powerful thing that &apos;s going to be the evolution of this particular , because evolution could now happen within a individual .
she could be in a period of time in a period of time .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
so as an example , the most powerful thing that &apos;s known is the human language .
it &apos;s a fairly amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , very complicated , and i &apos;m excited about the idea of my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and i &apos;m basically going to give you a little bit of the sound of me in the hope of creating a similar idea in your head that has a certain resemblance with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , and we turn it into sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of other .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we , the human , is we started abstract .
we &apos;re going through the same stages , which has gone through the way that we have the abstraction of our methods , which we &apos;re putting out data , process .
the invention of the language was a little step in this direction .
and the computer , computers , the , the , the , the , and so on , are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also , it &apos;s going to be more than we were .
so today , evolution can happen in the time of microseconds .
you &apos;ve seen a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a drug , where he showed a little evolution in the &quot; the program &quot; program , right before your eyes .
so we have the most important again again .
the first steps of history , which i told you , is a billion years a piece of a piece .
the next steps , as the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
then the most important steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to take a few decades .
the process of itself is feeding itself and it &apos;s going to be , i think , the word is the word -- if something is more powerful .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explosion .
we see the process that feeding itself .
i live in the building of computers , and i know that i &apos;m going to use the mechanism i use to build computers , not use , without the recently , the time of creating progress in computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design this in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what everybody &apos;s a transistor in the world &apos;s brain does .
it has billions of things .
what i do instead , and what the designers are doing is to make a certain kind of view , and we think of a certain kind of a little bit of the machine , and the machine makes it something that makes our skills far beyond , better
and it &apos;s part of the way that we &apos;re not even understanding of the way that we &apos;re not even going to understand .
a method which is particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been using in the last time is evolution itself .
we put a computer in the machine , which is going on in the field of the machine .
to call a example of a , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program which evolved from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , &quot; please , a hundred million randomly randomly randomly randomly , the sequences of instructions .
now , please , all of these randomly chosen instructions , all the programs , and they &apos;re going to take the programs , and they &apos;re finally choosing the ones that are the next . &quot;
so in other words , i &apos;m going to be first of what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of sort of like numbers that i &apos;ve been using for that .
so find programs that can be kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of stuff .
of course , the chance of random instructions is very small , that they &apos;re just kind of kind of kind of kind of a number of time , so they &apos;re probably not going to be able to do the instructions .
but one of those who may be with something happiness in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences , which are my goals on the next .
store this off , the rest of the rest .
now , all the state of the world &apos;s population , the numbers of the best , have the number of the numbers .
and that &apos;s a way of the kind of the design of the design , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their own , and the kids are going to get the features of the world &apos;s features of the two programs .
so i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that have been a little closer to the goals than others .
say , &quot; please , this process . &quot;
it &apos;s a little bit of a sudden .
maybe some mutations are going to run a few mutations .
and try to do this again with another generation .
all these generations only need a few milliseconds .
and so i can go through a evolution of millions of years in the computer in less minutes , or more complicated cases .
finally , i get programs that can be perfect to be quite kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind
the fact is that these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write from hand .
so if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t say how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s imaginary and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , i &apos;m sure they &apos;re doing the job because they come from a series of the programs , which have done the job .
because your life was standing on whether she was doing the job right .
i sat in a 747 with marvin , and i was in a 747 with marvin , and he says , &quot; oh , look . look at this . look at this .
there &apos;s this airplane , &quot; this airplane is made of the brain , which works together to make your flight safer . &quot; does it not make you a lot of the time ? &quot;
we know that a computer &apos;s brain is not optimal when it becomes too complicated .
so we start to leave on computers for a process which is different from classical engineering .
he allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it yet .
so , we &apos;re going to be able to do technology .
we &apos;re using these programs now to make the computer much faster , so that we can be able to do this processes faster .
so it creates a computer company .
it &apos;s going to be faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies of today are feeding themselves from themselves .
we raise off .
we &apos;re at a point that is analog at the time when the most powerful is evolved to be able to be developed .
so we &apos;re the most sophisticated and we can &apos;t really make what we &apos;re doing in the hell of the hell .
we &apos;re in the middle of this .
but i really believe that after us , something is going to happen .
i think it &apos;s very much of us to say that we are the final part of evolution .
and i think we all are part of the creation of what &apos;s going on as next .
now , lunch is before and i think i &apos;m going to hear here before i &apos;m going to get more .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert with the desert of the desert with a computer &apos;s office .
we talked about it , not changed since the time of ancient indian , &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted to travel in the indian , we went to a car and the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
and then when the big indian was the most popular of the world &apos;s book , he took a bow , fired in the floor and water came up .
now we &apos;re doing this with the world &apos;s brain and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that really made me sad .
i got something scared of technology .
it was scared that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without camera and no tweet on my friends .
i found that technology should be possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver .
this piece of 50 years old , the most old thing for me was the most powerful thing for me .
she was a more sophisticated access to a world full of pirates and the images of the ships in my mind .
i came to dream about the tags , and we were going to dream about the tags and cameras .
they were inspired by being inspired by it .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic rather than killing .
and i started to illustrate books with 16 .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling , the reader on the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s bringing pictures and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
storytelling always took more senses .
but what do we do with this ?
i &apos;m just going to go to a little bit of a interactive ipad .
here &apos;s &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s &quot; this box heard ... &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to be a character in the book .
and again , a letter is going down to me -- and the ipad knows through gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the child in me is really excited about this possibilities .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean a magician and dragon , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass , i always found very exciting .
so you have to get the ipad off here and fireflies go off .
and the light is the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single challenging .
and so here &apos;s every book , and every world , a little bit of a sudden that i &apos;m going to get here to the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
and the maps had always been maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows and it &apos;s lighting up and it &apos;s going to be the guidance of the book .
it also shows the other places of the book .
i go in here .
it &apos;s important for me to create something that is a lot of the time that it &apos;s also very much more powerful .
this is the most popular .
we &apos;ve heard all of the most sophisticated and more , but how many people know outside india , their indian colleagues , the most popular ?
the poor of the poor were caught in the chambers of the chambers in a old book , in a old book book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary history for children .
a story that &apos;s going to be able to do with new issues , like the most powerful .
the theme of the last 10 years , a big problem of the last 10 years , is that children in their rooms are sitting in their rooms , without out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you have to get out and collect the camera of the ipads of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of the street , rocks , and the shells , and the shells .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do more .
this is the most important thing that &apos;s going to be brought up . you have to go out to make a photograph of a flower , and tag it .
in another chapter , you have to put a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of light and tag .
so , you actually create a digital collection of photos that you can put online .
a child in london shows the picture of a computer , and says , &quot; oh , today i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; today i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities that are magic , and the world and technology .
in the next book , we plan a interaction that you use the video of the ipads and through augmented reality , a animation of the flowering , which seems to appear on a plant before the house .
on a place , the screen is going to go with leaves .
you have to do the sound of the brain &apos;s sound , you &apos;re going to read it off and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the forces of technology are closer and in the magic and technology , and the technology can be in the magic .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children to the natural world and we get closer to the natural world , and the magic of our childhood , and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really a extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in the prison , prisons or a plastic .
i spend most of my time with social weakest in the world &apos;s most powerful and places that are very much hopelessness .
and here at ted , to see , and hear how stimulating that is , i gave me a lot of power .
in the short time here , i was a clear one : ted has an identity .
you can say things that have the world influence .
and sometimes , if something comes over ted , it gets an significance and force that otherwise didn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher have a teacher , but the words of a dedicated teacher is particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional school household , which was dominated by a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a pet , and this kind of millennium was
she was a computer company , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every single single way .
she was also the beginning of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a computer company .
their parents were born in the nanoscale in virginia as slaves .
she was born around the 1930s , and the experience of slavery shaped her view very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met them as a little boy , she came to me and gave me a ph.d. .
she was so stuck that i couldn &apos;t breathe . then she would go .
one or two hours later , when i came to her , she came to me and said , &quot; do you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said no , &quot; no , you &apos;d give me a little bit again , if i said , &quot; yes , she &apos;d put me in quiet .
and she was something that made that you wanted to be in your near .
the only problem that was that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins went around everywhere .
i remember , i have to have been eight or nine , that i woke up a morning and went to the living room . all my cousins went around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room and i looked at it .
first , i thought that &apos;s a game .
i saw them and smiles , but they saw very seriously .
and that was 15 or 20 minutes , and then she stood up and came up with me . she took me on the hand and said , &quot; come on , &quot; come on . you have to talk . &quot;
i remember that as if it was yesterday .
i &apos;m never going to forget it .
she took me out and said , &quot; i &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t have it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re a little special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;m never going to forget that .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me three things , &quot; you know , i &apos;ve got to promise . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i &apos;m going to say you &apos;re going to love your mom forever . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby and you have to promise that you &apos;re always going to take care of them . &quot;
i &apos;m going to be able to get my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , that &apos;s going to be . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next to me , you &apos;ll always do the right thing . &quot; even if it falls hard , the right thing to do is to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
and finally she said , &quot; the last thing you &apos;ve got to promise me is &quot; that you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south and i have a brother who &apos;s older , and one year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this kind of a beer to my sister , and i went to the forest , and i went to the forest .
we &apos;re just going to be there as well as otherwise .
then he took a drink of beer and offered my sister to one , and she took me , and then they offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . ok . it &apos;s just . it &apos;s just not a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do it . we &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re going to do anything else , what we do .
i had what , your sister had what . go , a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . do you just do it . &quot; just do it . &quot;
my brother was looking at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , what &apos;s going on . &quot;
then he looked at me in the face , and he said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t always do it crazy because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells everybody that they are special . &quot;
i was devastated on the floor .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
i should probably not do that .
this is perhaps going to transmit public .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m going to be a drop of alcohol , i &apos;ve never been drinking a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s a lot of time , i say that &apos;s the identity of the identity .
if we create the right way of identity , we can tell people things about us , which they don &apos;t think of .
we can get them to do things that they thought they could not .
of course , my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they &apos;re special .
my grandfather was during the prison of prison .
my uncle died on the ground of the disease .
and she believed that this was the themes that we need to take care of .
i tried to say something about our educational system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in the &apos; 80s , 300,000 people were in the prison and prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest rate of the world .
seven million people are released in the end of the ground or with a supernova .
i think of the world &apos;s most fundamental , the world &apos;s fundamentally changed .
in social weak and black parts of the population , despair and hopelessness , because of this changes .
one of three male black black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , on the ground , or with a shoe , or with a supernova .
in urban communities everywhere , in the country -- from los angeles , baltimore to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of all black young men either in prison , in prison , on the ground , or with a shoe .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have to do with the other thing that &apos;s going to have to do with poverty .
we have a court system that you &apos;re treating much better , if you &apos;re rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
wealth , not draw , it affects the result .
yet , we seem to be very pleased with it .
a policy of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a couple of the developments there .
my home home is permanently to take the right , if you &apos;re being convicted of it .
here in alabama today , 34 percent of the male black population is permanent to be lost .
we predict that in 10 years the world &apos;s history is going to be so high , as far as the most prolific of the world &apos;s brain .
the silence is a little bit of the time .
i represent kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , the most prolific children in the prison .
in this country , there are children &apos;s lives for children &apos;s lives without genetic water .
we &apos;ve been running a lot of process .
the only country of the world .
i represent people in the field of time .
the question of death penalty is an interesting question .
we think because you &apos;ve taught us that the real question is , is a human being made , is a human being to die for one of them .
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think about it , depending on how we see our identity .
the other view is not , does anybody have a crime that deserves death , but , do we deserve to kill ?
i find the fascinating thing .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
on nine people we &apos;ve executed , one that we &apos;ve been executed for innocent , who was released , the more prolific and from death row .
an amazing thing . one of nine innocent .
i find the fascinating thing .
we would never let anybody fly with a plane when for nine planes , the air , a crash .
but somehow we create it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i &apos;m talking much about these questions .
i talk about race and the question , whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m african-american my students , and i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , the time against the end of the world &apos;s population , until the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know a lot about it .
but for the african-american , it was a time of terror .
in many areas people had to have fear of the world .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that they shaped their lives .
these older people are now coming to me and say , &quot; mr , &quot; you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re talking to the talks , you &apos;re going to say , you &apos;re going to stop saying that we should stop to do it for the first time
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the persians and decades of the world &apos;s population has recovered and apartheid .
and yet , there &apos;s a dynamic , and we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what the meaning of our actions have in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly going to go together .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to be willing to get the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the persians are not to overcome without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve been thinking about a few talks in germany .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply very jolly , you &apos;re talking about it . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany there &apos;s no death sentence .
and of course , it can never give you more . &quot;
it was very silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we &apos;ve ever been killing ourselves for the systematic of people .
it would be a lot of us , and it &apos;s aware of people . &quot;
i thought about it .
as it would feel , in a world where german state people had had been able to get people to the german state , especially when they were a lot of jews .
it would be mathematically .
it would be a little bit of a time .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , we &apos;re going to be people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted of death , 11 times higher when the victim is white , and the victim knows -- in the
and yet there &apos;s this mental compass .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with this difficult topics , the positive topics are also affected , and the great things .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities are going to be the suffering of suffering , abuse , the blink , urbanization .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we finally talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to be able to be in a complex world .
for me , the time is to create time , and talk about the poor , the disadvantaged , the dragline , that never will be at ted .
but think about a way of doing that in our own life .
we all need to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re also so rational , so we estimate the intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development , don &apos;t only come from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this kind of thing that i think you &apos;re going to drive us , not just to be open for all the light and the things that are also for the dark and the dark and the dark and the dark and the dark .
and the big one , the great thing , the great thing , has said , &quot; well , the great thing .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe against oppression , we wanted everything to do , but what we needed most , hope , a mental guidance , the willingness to be a mental orientation , and to be witness . &quot;
this mental guidance is the core of what i believe that also the most important thing to do is to be involved in this .
there &apos;s no distinction to technology and design that allows us to be very , very long , and even human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears , and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity is very much more of us than if we don &apos;t have to be able to do it .
it &apos;s going to touch it deeply .
as a young lawyer , i &apos;m going to meet the great privilege , pink parks .
and again , again , again , back to the back of the world , where they were going to get two of their oldest friends , they were going to be the older women , the most incredible women who had organized the most powerful -- an incredible
so these women met and talked to them .
and then , &quot; i said , &quot; i said , &quot; i said , &quot; i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk to you , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk to you . &quot;
do you want to go in and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very like . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and just heard about it .
it was always so inspiring , so that &apos;s what it was like .
one day i sat there and heard this women , and after a few hours , ms. parks turned to me , said , &quot; well , you know , what &apos;s the initiative for the same right .
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to put against injustice .
and people want to help people who were convicted of innocent .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the world &apos;s office .
we want to eradicate the world &apos;s lives without genetic food for children .
we want to do something against death companies .
we want to lower the number of death rates .
we want to eradicate the food . &quot;
i thought my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go . &quot;
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to make it very , very tired . &quot;
then woman was going to me , put a finger on my face , and he said , &quot; and therefore you have to be very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
and so i think that the ted community should be the ted community .
we need to make ways to make this challenges : these problems , this suffering .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a few very simple things .
that we all are more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for everyone on the planet .
if someone lies , he &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t hear him , it &apos;s not just a subtle .
even who kills someone &apos;s not just a murderer .
and because that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that needs to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think that too many places that are the opposite of poverty .
and finally , i think , although you &apos;re so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so stimulating , we &apos;re not going to be measured at the end of our technology , not to the things we &apos;re developing , not in our intellect and minds
finally , a society is not measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged , but it &apos;s how they deal with the poor , the average , the most prolific .
because in this context , we start to understand the real amazing things that make us happen .
sometimes i lose the balance . a story to end .
sometimes i urge too much .
i &apos;m going to be tired of how we all .
sometimes , the ideas of our thinking is ahead of our thinking , very important way .
i represent these kids who were convicted of very hard to be convicted of .
i go to the most popular and visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and the adult is supposed to be in court .
then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn somebody into something that he doesn &apos;t have ?
the judge looks like adults , but i see a child .
one night , i stayed too long and thought , my goodness , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he has to have a little bit of a time .
right , the judge , the judge has a lot of the judge .
you should also be able to do whatever .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think more right , i started working on a bill .
i had a 14 year-old black young young young young boys than clients .
and i started with this bill . the headline was , &quot; bill , my arms , 14 black clients like a privileged , white , &quot; to treat a privileged , white , &quot; and the most powerful . &quot;
in my bill , i explained that error is the most important and the police and the police .
there was a crazy line about that in this country that is nothing more appropriate that there &apos;s only a mistake .
the next morning i woke up and didn &apos;t know if i just dreamed of this crazy bill or actually written him .
and i didn &apos;t just write him , but i was sent to the court .
a few months , and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided i was , my god , i have to be in the dish and this crazy case .
i went to the car and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i drove to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard to do so painful .
finally , i went out of my car and went up the stairs to the court .
when i was the staircase to the court , there was a elderly black man who &apos;s the janitors in the dish .
when he saw me , he came up with me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and gave me .
then he was going to me in the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched something very deep in me , identity , the ability to contribute every single one , something to a community of hope .
well , i walked the most popular .
once the judge looked at me .
he said , &quot; mr. ostrow , you asked this crazy bill ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started discussing .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
i had written this crazy stuff .
and the most powerful , and the office team , and office workers , and office workers .
in the most violent , the most powerful part of people who were angry is that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
i saw the janitors , i saw the janitors and go off .
he always saw over the window and it could hear all the whole things .
he went and down .
finally , this older black man came with a very brought in the most powerful and put it straight behind me , almost on the most sophisticated .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
while the pause came in , a computer company was in the way that the janitors were in the most violent .
this is the most important thing about the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the most violent ? &quot;
the older black man stood on . he saw the most popular , then he saw me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m come to say , &quot; i &apos;m coming to say that young man , you don &apos;t lose the goal . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far more powerful , but that it &apos;s the justice of justice .
that we &apos;re not fully developed as humans , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and the most powerful .
that our survival is related to survival every single one .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and design , from entertainment and creativity , and justice , compassion and justice .
and especially i want to do that from you , which is just just saying , just say , you don &apos;t have the goal of the eyes . don &apos;t give you .
they have seen this audience , this community , and i heard a obvious wish to help you and do something .
what can we do ?
and the most profound , there &apos;s all kinds of opportunities .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a little bit of a time in this spring that is about the way that it &apos;s actually a effort to do something from the most powerful , which is the other thing that &apos;s going on in politics .
here , in california , you &apos;ll be a billion dollars for the death penalty for the death penalty , a billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all the most sophisticated things don &apos;t end with a very convenient .
56 percent of all the world &apos;s population is not coming in court .
there &apos;s the chance to do something .
this is the kind of thing that &apos;s going to suggest to be able to invest in more of the money and security .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the most powerful in america is smooth .
this fact is often asked in a context with the increased of the rising .
what would you say to someone who believes ?
now , in fact , the number of the world &apos;s brain doesn &apos;t change very much .
most of the most popular in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of the world &apos;s class .
it was the most popular thing to do against drugs .
so the dramatic numbers come to the prisoners .
we have a lot of the rhetoric of the punishment .
now we have &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; , which is the people who get to the grid for the grid , for a computer , for the theft of the theft , and that you &apos;re making it , you can pull them out the victims of the
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a design of a design of a design , not less .
and i think our current world &apos;s current is not helping anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
and they really have a string of the way that they have a string .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
thank you , at ted . thank you very much .
bin laden is bringing a increase to the increase .
two : famine in somalia . three : spray of the police .
four : more enlightened , more dangerous . five : dangerous .
six : social decline . seven : 65 dead .
eight : the speaker &apos;s day .
different speakers : the mass destruction . video destruction .
recession . a standstill . egypt . egypt .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it would have been the last six days . or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative topics , because our minds are going to be the same thing that we &apos;re doing .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second every day , our senses will start much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first stop is the first stop of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early school system , our main system .
it &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s going to be the whole information on the search for any of the relationship in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage &quot; if it &apos;s going to be the demand , the demand is very true .
now , with all our digital devices that we have seven days the week , 24 hours a day , the very negative news is not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s always worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe this is the reality .
maybe the enormous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century is that we &apos;ve made a series of forces in the last century , so that it &apos;s possible to create us in the next three decades , a world of abundance .
well , i don &apos;t say we don &apos;t have a big problems -- climate crisis , water , water , water and energy systems -- we &apos;ve already got .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at the way that we &apos;re going to be able to do problems in very long ways , but they eventually get to overcome .
so let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , which has tripled to inflation , the world &apos;s population .
child mortality has reduced to a tenth .
and that &apos;s what the most important thing is that the most powerful , the most powerful , and it &apos;s reduced to a diet .
steve pinker showed us that we &apos;re currently in a very peaceful time of life .
and according to charles hopkins , the most prolific in the past 130 years of 25 percent of 25 percent of the time is up .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we &apos;re increasing our expectations constantly further .
in fact , we &apos;ve defined poverty .
remember , a big fraction of americans who live under poverty , access to electricity , water , toilets , the wooden , tv , mobile phones , mobile phones , cell phone , gas , gas .
the richest sanitation of the last century , the world &apos;s population , would never have been able to dream such luxury .
the basis for a lot of it is technologies , and these are growing up .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that &apos;s going to be the information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , is making great jumps , and the most 12 to 24 months .
so that &apos;s what the mobile phone costs in your pocket about a million times less and more than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how smooth you go -- in good times , war or peace , recession , depression and the gun , depression and the world .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
it &apos;s slowed down for none of our great problems .
and also , despite your logarithmic , it &apos;s going to go up to the left .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to all of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm supercomputer watson in &quot; risk ? &quot;
it was great .
i &apos;ve been looking for newspapers and looking for the best headlines that i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson &apos;s human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that these artificial intelligence has been available for each owner of a computer system .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i started a new university , which is called &quot; singularity university . &quot;
we bring our students all these technologies , with special focus on how these are being used to solve the big challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students to create companies , products and services that can affect the lives of billions of people .
think about that , that a group of students can affect the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
today we can be labeled in dozens of companies that have been done right now .
if i think to create abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating a plastic of goods .
and scarcity is the most powerful , and technology is a resource of a resource .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of the world &apos;s history of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of the day to dinner .
and the soldiers were getting a little bit of the time , and they got a little bit of the time .
but the king of the world &apos;s king was got a lot of time .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , valuable than gold and the blink .
this is why the dome was made of aluminum .
although aluminum is the percent of the world &apos;s population , it &apos;s not going to be a pure metal .
it &apos;s going to be connected through oxygen and the water .
but then the technology of the world &apos;s technology became developed and made more cheap that we use it with our main system .
then let &apos;s put this analogy in the future .
we think today about the most important .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet of the world &apos;s energy , and we &apos;re using more energy than we use a year .
16 of the energy energy is all the time of the world &apos;s land .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is .
and there are good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time , the cost for solar in india to 50 percent of the most prolific -- the 1.5 rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost for solar fell in the last year for 50 percent .
last month , this has published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the united states , solar six cents per capita , is going to cost to 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have a energy imbalance , we &apos;ll also have water in the abundance .
let &apos;s talk about the design of the world .
do you remember when carl sagan was the most popular 1990 when it was saturn , back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a &quot; a blue blue . &quot;
because we live on a computer company .
we live on a planet that is covered to 70 percent of water .
yes , it &apos;s a percent of water , two percent of the water , and we &apos;re fighting to be 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new design on the way , and it &apos;s a new way of doing it .
and from a conversation today with dean &apos;s , one of the innovators of the design of doing it , i want to share something with you -- he gave me permission -- his favorite , the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the
it can produce a thousand gallons of water per day from different sources -- whether seawater , a , lesbian water , latrine -- and all of that for less than two cents per liter .
the director of coca-cola has just been a big , big one of the things that are going on with a hundred units in developing countries .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , and then coca-cola will apply this technology globally in the world .
this is a innovation innovation that &apos;s now there .
and we &apos;ve seen this at mobile phones .
you mean , my goodness , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 2013 .
just consider that a computer company with a mobile phone in the middle of kenya has a better more powerful than president reagan , 25 years ago .
and if you look at google on google , you have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the abundance of how nobody could have been able to predict .
and it &apos;s better , and it &apos;s better , and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , and the photo , libraries and photo , libraries of books and music , technology , and the technology of the medical imaging -- are literally going to be more
and the best thing about it is perhaps what we expect in the field of health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure , with the most popular , the &quot; $ 10 million of the city , &quot; &quot; &quot; $ 10 million of the city . &quot;
we demand teams all over the world , all these technologies in a mobile phone that you can talk to with the device , because it &apos;s equipped with ai , you can test it or test your own .
and to win , the device has to make a better diagnosis than a team of the doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of the staff of health care , and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
if this device sequenced a little bit of a sudden or a more powerful , it &apos;s not known to the health system , and it &apos;s going to stop the world &apos;s population , and it &apos;s a pandemic of their outbreak .
but now to the biggest force that &apos;s going to lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we just crossed the most sophisticated .
and by the way , the largest most important thing about a population population is a better education and diet in all the world .
in 2010 , we had just been connected to two billion people online .
until 2020 , we &apos;re going to go out of two billion internet internet .
three billion new minds we never heard before , the global communication will join .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what will you want ?
and instead of ecological , i see one of the largest economic systems of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that are going to flow in global economy .
and they will be healthier by using the use of the design , and they &apos;re trained better through the most powerful , and that they &apos;re going to have the opportunity to use 3d printers and &quot; the &quot; aw computing , &quot; and so much more productive
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the world &apos;s population ?
as it would be with a sentence of new , never before the voices of the other .
how about it , the oppressed , where they &apos;re always , to give a voice to make attention to themselves and create change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
how about the way that it would be with the way that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i learned through the x prize is that small teams that are motivated by passion and focus , are capable of creating extraordinary things , things that could only create big companies and governments in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that may have already known some .
it &apos;s a game called the truffles .
it was developed in the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will evolve .
the way to the behavior is we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the most important .
so , this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university university .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that today the human pattern pattern is better than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked , who &apos;s the best most powerful of the world , this was not a more powerful , not a more powerful , and it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was working in the day of the
ladies and gentlemen , what i &apos;m going to trust in our future is that we have more power today than individuals , to make us the big challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a computer system .
we have the capital of the world &apos;s capital .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online to master the new challenges , and to do that , what &apos;s needed .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to have something against a computer project of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical medical and i &apos;m .
and maybe i &apos;m a long enough in business when i can give it a piece of my own wrong , to give this a piece of my own wrong .
but before i &apos;m going to talk to my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re the most close , and we &apos;re moving on the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is &quot; soon , &quot; and it turns around statistics and to use this great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to get to a statistic of the way i hope that most of you have heard about it .
it &apos;s the most popular of the world &apos;s brain .
we talk about a 300 , if a bat is 300 .
that means that the player is going to be a lot of 10 beats .
this is the ball of the ball , he &apos;s coming up , he &apos;s not going to be caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball to the first base , it didn &apos;t have been done at time and the cover was in security .
three from 10 10 .
do you know how to call a computer company in the blink of the league of baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a computer company .
do you know how to call a computer system ?
this is somebody in the rest of the rest of the world .
and the last thing that ted williams was doing -- the last ted league of baseball &apos;s player was running in the last year of a regular season .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot more comfortable or maybe a little less likely to do that , and maybe a little less likely to do that .
imagine a little bit of a sudden and you &apos;ll be able to be able to be able to be a little bit of a time of the day of the day of the day of the day .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine life in a particular remote area and you have a beloved people with the flowering of the world , and you have a beloved person to a little bit of the time that &apos;s a little bit of a time of the world , which is a lot
but , but do you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better . it &apos;s on the top branch .
and she &apos;s beating a computer .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the most powerful thing for a car or a nurse or a nurse , should be a computer company ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody in the whole medicine knows what a good surgeon should be or a doctor or a doctor or a doctor .
but what we do is we &apos;re all of them , including me , including the world with the claim of perfect .
never a mistake , no one makes it , but it &apos;s going to be about the details of how this is being done .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was a vegetarian student .
in high school , a peers said that brian was going to learn to learn a blood service for a blood service .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little little bit of the sisters in the sisters in the toronto general hospital , and i was in the toronto of this .
i learned everything .
in my favorite , i learned the origins and tail every single branch of every artery , every branch of every artery , which is the aorta , and the ascending and ordinary .
i even knew the most popular to classify the most sophisticated of the world &apos;s office .
and the time i &apos;ve been collecting more and more .
and i was good , i was going to get off with a little bit of a sudden .
and i left the medical school school that i was doing , if i knew everything , and everything knew , or at least as much as possible , as close as possible , that i was immune against that .
and it worked for a time until i met wife printer .
i &apos;m going to be in toronto in a school school in toronto as a woman in the hospital , and i was brought into the hospital of the hospital .
and at that point , i was in the service of the service of the service .
and it was my mission when the most popular advice was looking at the most powerful advice .
and feedback to my favorite .
i studied ms. printer and she was in a prison shop .
and when i &apos;m going to address her , she made sound .
and when i was in your chest with the most powerful , i could hear a little bit of a sound of both sides that said that she suffered under the heart failure .
this is a state that fails to be the heart of the heart , rather than pump the entire blood on the lung , and it &apos;s going to be a part of the blood , and that &apos;s what the most obvious thing came out , and that
and that was not hard to be a diagnosis of the diagnosis .
i put them and made me care of treatment .
i gave her a little bit of a sudden . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call the water , water pills , so that they &apos;re going to be the liquid .
and over a period of a year , it started to feel better .
i felt good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
i actually did two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my favorite school .
i didn &apos;t take the way to the track and did what i should have been , what was a call in my favorite , and it was a chance to make a chance to make a sense of a picture .
and he knew she would have been able to be able to get more information to her .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the most popular doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility that i was so able to worry about my patients without having to contact it .
my second mistake was worse .
so that i sent them home , i &apos;m a quiet voice in me , who tried to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . do that . &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s really a very much of me in the very very successful , that i asked the nurse which was taking care of ms. printer , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay if you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and he said in a way , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to go well . &quot;
i remember it as it was yesterday .
so i &apos;m going to get the most sophisticated and a ambulance and a ambulance and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this kind of kind of feeling in my stomach .
but i continued to go on .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , and i went to the parking parking , and i went to the parking parking for the car , when i did something that i didn &apos;t do .
i went home through the street of my way home .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen after woman &apos;s printer , but another three words to me and fear these three words that i know .
other medical medical medical people fear these , but the most important thing is , because we &apos;re just seeing the patients as well .
the three words , remember , remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient you &apos;d thought home ? &quot;
the nurse was asked .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular kind of thing .
so she was back .
she was back and dying .
about a hour after that she was sent home after i sent her home , she collapsed and the family called the memex . the most popular , she brought back to the top of a blood pressure , which is a dangerous one .
they hardly breathe and was blue .
the most sophisticated thing was all the strands .
they gave her a little bit of their own .
they closed them on the top of the world .
i was shocked and to the inside of the inner .
and i &apos;m going to get these rollercoaster because they came to the intensive care of intensive care , and i hoped they would recover .
and after two , three days , it was clear that they never would have a awakening .
she didn &apos;t have a huge thing to do .
their family gathered up .
and the next eight or nine days , she made the most salient .
the day day , they &apos;re going to go -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say that you never forget the names of the world &apos;s name .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
the next weeks i did , i was going to have the first time to do the unhealthy shame , which exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , not the way of healthy shame that you feel because you can &apos;t talk about the colleagues about
you know all the healthy shame if you have a secret of the best friend , although this one on a little bit of a sudden and you &apos;ll get a very , and the best friend is going to be a very , very , very , very
if you &apos;re doing the mistake and never make the mistakes again .
this is the kind of plastic of shame .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is that it &apos;s going to make a very sick thing .
it &apos;s the one that says that it &apos;s not what you did , but you &apos;re bad , it &apos;s bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t on the reason of my favorite , he was very happy .
he talked to the family and i &apos;m sure he was the most powerful , and sure i wouldn &apos;t be sued .
but i asked myself to ask these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the most popular thing ? why do i send them home ?
and then in my worst moments : how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why went to medicine ?
but slowly , it &apos;s safe .
i started feeling better .
and then in a day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke up and i could be able to feel better , i could feel better .
and i was in my own , that if i doubled my efforts to perfection and never put a mistake , the voice could be a little bit of a mistake .
and she did .
and i continued to go on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the middle of the hospital in a hospital hospital north of toronto and i was a 25 years old man with a half of the old man .
it was a lot of los and i was in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked at the most powerful and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and as he went from the door , he showed up on his own .
two days later , i came to my next school , and my favorite was asked me to be a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : remember you ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the patient &apos;s office ? &quot;
it turns out he was a computer company .
he had potentially a potentially more powerful disease called the &quot;
you can google that , but it &apos;s not infection of the most prolific , but the top of the top of the world &apos;s top is the top of the world &apos;s .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got a little bit of a time , and he recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same kind of shame and the humanities , and i felt that i was getting rid of the work to work and again and again .
in a computer factory , i &apos;ve been missing two times a computer .
there &apos;s a lot of it , especially if you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital that &apos;s just 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and they probably didn &apos;t have a stereo in their treatment .
i thought he would have been a little bit of a time .
i &apos;m going to get the x-ray of the kidney . when that was without a more powerful , my colleague was in the bottom of the patient &apos;s house , and called the surgeons .
the other was strong diarrhea .
i &apos;m going to be a lot of the time to get him to the way to go to the and asked my colleagues too .
and it did and he was in the right the bottom of the right sector , called the surgeons .
in both cases , it was a good thing to do .
both cases of me , i &apos;m on the way .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues , but total nonsense is .
some of my favorite , in the last five years , happened in the last five years .
alone , it &apos;s ashamed of support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t close with my mistakes and talk about them , if i &apos;m going to be quiet , what &apos;s really happening , what &apos;s really happening , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes , so that they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i was in a room -- like now , i don &apos;t know what you think about me .
when did you hear the last time from someone who talked about the most of the time of the world &apos;s book about the world &apos;s book ?
oh yes , you go to a cocktail party and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about your own mistakes .
if i had a full of a room with colleagues , and to tell her immediate support , and i would give you what i &apos;m telling you , i would not be able to reach the end of the second story before it really would be uncomfortable ,
and in fact , when i knew or my colleagues , that a computer company had been able to have a little leg in my hospital , and then you think i would have trouble to look at him in the eyes .
this is the system we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system that is two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do it . those who are sleeping , the sleep , who &apos;s going to be sleeping with bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s almost a ideological response like antibodies that attack a human .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we &apos;re doing the ones that are going to be able to be able to be able to be a secure system , we &apos;re going to be a safe system .
but there are two problems in this .
in my about 20 years of medical , and journalism , i have a personal medical study about medical errors and false treatments to make all of me possible for my first article , which i &apos;m going to do for the toronto star , which i &apos;m talking
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely a very sophisticated .
we &apos;re working in a system that &apos;s going to happen every day in the day that is either a false or wrong , and it &apos;s always more likely to be more and more than more and more than the other , and the devastation or the other
in this state , about 24,000 canadian in the world die .
in the united states , the institute of medicine was the number of 100,000 .
both are strong , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as well as we should .
and it &apos;s the most popular .
in a computer factory that &apos;s going to be doubling all two to three years , we can &apos;t keep it .
sleep sleep is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake , so we can take a perfect design system for a patient chest chest .
then i take the same patient with the same patient , making it a little bit of a little bit of a breath and give it a slightly bit of a breath and suddenly , and it &apos;s a slightly bit of a mess with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same way .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms always in the same way .
all of this is the mistake of mistakes .
so if you take the system like that , how i was taught , and all the most sophisticated things that are going on , then , there &apos;s no more left .
and you know the most powerful about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , white , black , black , &quot; i have the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to every one of the most popular to the most of the world &apos;s office , &quot; this is my
and then your hobbies expand , you &apos;re coming out of your head , and you &apos;re looking down and you &apos;re going to be hard to tell you , and you &apos;re going to go to your stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what you need is a environment that you &apos;re able to do in the situation .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new one is a human being , white , white , to be accepted , is not proud of making mistakes , but it &apos;s going to be something that can be passed out of them so that it can be passed .
they share their experiences with other people .
they &apos;re supporting the other of their mistakes .
and she shows other their mistakes , not about the most powerful , but in a loving , supportive way of all of that .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life and when that &apos;s so , people are also going to be mistakes of time .
so that the system is developed to create the system that makes it easier to find mistakes , which are inevitable , and also allow to create a supportive spaces where everybody who is looking at health care , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be rewarded for
my name is brian marx .
i &apos;m defined with the new doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i &apos;m making mistakes .
i &apos;m a very , very , very , very , very , very , very possible to learn to learn to get it to other people .
i don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live with life .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , small idea .
it &apos;s about the most powerful .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories to use the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he &apos;s in the middle of the world .
you may think he &apos;s going to hunt , but it &apos;s not true .
it actually collected fish .
he described one of them as a very common .
it was a computer company .
until the &apos; 80s , he was brought into great style .
now he &apos;s standing on the red list of the way .
this story we &apos;ve heard many times from the galapagos or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we still come on the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the most powerful thing you &apos;re going to describe is still a pristine .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is a different concept that &apos;s going to show the most important thing , and it &apos;s a different concept .
because i &apos;ve experienced it when i studied a lagoon in the middle of 1971 .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate .
and i got a bad transplant and was convinced that i really didn &apos;t have it from there .
it was my first blast .
as you see , the lagoon of palms and a few of the trees are a few of the trees .
there was a little bit of a time of about 20 inches , a subset of the world &apos;s office .
the fisheries of this is very productive and the fishermen lived well , and they were doing good in ghana above the top of ghana .
when i returned to 27 years later , the fish was blown up half his size .
adult crashes are going to measure five centimeters .
they were genetically modified .
it &apos;s still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had the happiness to be there .
so it doesn &apos;t change anything , and yet everything changed .
my third little story tells my favorite story of my favorite in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- more to the beginning of the 1960s -- the world &apos;s europe , many more sophisticated .
and the world &apos;s population meant countries that started 100 fish , the industrial fishing of this pretty ugly ship called the fourth fourth ship .
i went to this , and we did the census in the entire southern sea ocean and especially in the world &apos;s atmosphere .
we had no words for what we started there .
i know that it was the reason of the ocean .
90 percent of our favorite , sponges , other animals , who are connected to the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the small dots there on the pavement , were the most powerful , the most powerful .
basically , the bottom of the ocean was going to be thrown up and then thrown down .
these images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you have a survey , and then it starts with the commercial fishing .
the reason is changing . from this case -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals will be crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they were not eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we started a living life .
she wasn &apos;t drowning .
then they wanted to kill them because they could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain is going to be raised by the body , and when you go into areas , you &apos;re never going to be able to get into the areas of that .
it &apos;s not going to be documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we &apos;re going to fit our main level of the new level and we don &apos;t call us memory , which was there .
if you &apos;re going to get it out , this is happening .
on the y-axis , some good things are : biodiversity , number of the most powerful , the green of your country , the most powerful .
and the time it changes it . it changes , because for people , they &apos;re all the way to do it .
every generation of the images that you &apos;re looking at at the beginning of your conscious life as a standard and it &apos;s going to get everything .
the difference is going to be seen as loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can give a order of changes .
and at the end , they want to get the most sophisticated remains .
that &apos;s largely our goal now .
we want to get things that are gone or things that are not so much like they were .
you could think that the problem was the problem of people who certainly were living when they lived in the societies , killed animals and they were just aware of a few generations , which they had done .
because obviously , a animal that was very often , just once , once it &apos;s going to be a lot of time before it &apos;s going to be .
so you don &apos;t lose any natural animals .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s been seen as a big loss .
and we &apos;re focusing on the big animals , and we &apos;re the big fish in the ocean .
they &apos;re going to be less , because we start .
and the time is a little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the most popular .
the question is , why people accept that .
well , because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , many people are going to confirm scientists , they &apos;re really different .
they &apos;re going to confirm it because the evidence , as they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of a computer company , which was in this area , can be seen big , not used , or usually , not being used , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific &quot; .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in the developed societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous big role that can play a marine reserve .
because in marine field , we &apos;re basically going to get the past back .
we &apos;re going back to the past that people can &apos;t understand , because the most powerful thing is changing and very low .
so people who can see a marine reserve and benefit from the view that it enables to be able to be able to get their own , their own .
what about people who don &apos;t have possible , because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the middle west for example ?
here , i think , i think , the art and the film may fill the gap , and simulations .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was a lot of time in front of this -- 500 years ago .
and the most popular and the most powerful , you might remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were touched by this -- except from the most prolific , why were they touched by the most prolific ?
because it &apos;s something that was lost in a way that &apos;s lost in a way .
so my only one that i &apos;m going to give you is to take a , and it &apos;s going to be a &quot; avatar ii &quot; under water .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist , you had to , if you had a typewriter , that in the government , you had to get this in the government .
they also had to put a sheet of the glass of this typewriter .
the reason that the government could be able to get out of the world is where a text came from .
they found a paper with a little bit of a paper , they could detect the creator of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do something like this , and how much the freedom of freedom would be constrained .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
but if you buy a new computer system today in 2011 , a new computer system is going to print and print a page , then this page has light yellow yellow on every side , in a pattern that makes the site clear on them and their printer
this is what happens today .
and nobody seems to be a little bit of a sudden .
and that was an example of what our own governments are doing to us , the citizens , using the citizens .
and this is one of the three main types of energy today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three main types .
there are a lot of the time .
for example , this is mr. &apos;s favorite , and that &apos;s the gentleman &apos;s favorite of the world &apos;s .
and the motives of the most easy are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use the way to make a lot of money , a huge pile of money .
there are several known cases of the world &apos;s time , and they have a lot of time that they have a money through attacks .
this is a little bit of a plastic of the brain in estonia .
this is alfred &apos;s .
stephen watts .
the most powerful thing .
these are matthew anderson , and so on and so on .
these people are online to wealth , but they &apos;ve acquired it , by using a ph.d. , for example , to claws , to claws from our bank , while we do our online online , or also online , which has collected our main system on the
the u.s. intelligence intelligence of two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam &apos;s swiss , and on this cover , was a vegetarian million dollars , when it was frozen .
mr. milliken itself is on free feet , the coup is unknown .
and i &apos;m saying that today , we &apos;re more likely to be victims of a computer &apos;s face than a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is still worse .
in the future , most crimes are going to play online .
the second second thing we can see today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests about , one opinion , or through their audience .
groups like anonymous are moving over the last 12 months and have become one of the most prolific on the field of the world &apos;s field .
so these are the three main ones : criminals that are doing it for the money because of anonymous , which is the resistance of the power , but the last group are nations , governments that lead the attacks .
there are cases of how the world &apos;s disease .
it shows a great thing , which is when governments attack their own citizens .
and it &apos;s a computer company from the netherlands -- or it was it .
in the last fall , it had to be a sign of the end , because it was hacked .
somebody was hacked and had the system to be hacked .
and last week in a meeting with dutch , i asked one of the senior of these group , whether he was able to do it for possible , because of the most important people who were died of the world .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how do people die in a very remote way ?
and it &apos;s a computer company .
they sell them to the .
what do you do with a little bit of the way ?
now , a certificate takes you , if you have a website with a website with a service of service , for example , for example , for example .
now we &apos;re using all of us , or many of us , or a of the competitors , but these services are particularly prevalent in the u.s. states like iran , where the hiv &apos;s foreign , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to
but you can , if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign .
and it &apos;s a fake , and fake the fake .
and that &apos;s what happens in the case of the world &apos;s case .
how do it act with the arab spring and the things that are happening for example ?
now , in egypt , the tar plaque in april 2011 , the headquarters of egyptian , and they found a lot of records .
in these records , a folder was called &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in this folder , notes were in germany , who had sold a few programs that were sold to a few programs that they were in very large frame -- all communication of the egyptian citizens could capture .
they had sold this program for the flowering euros to the egyptian government .
the most powerful thing is right here .
so western governments feed governments with the most powerful , so that they can do the other people &apos;s own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , just a few weeks ago , the so-called a few weeks ago , that was a juvenile , which was used by german , to be used to their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be in a corporate community , it will be pretty security to be your phone .
but today we are far beyond that .
they tap their connection .
they use resources like the most powerful , to make their computers with a certificate , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their own communication , their own , their individuality .
so if we think about these things , the obvious answer of people would be : &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not true , because i &apos;m a good citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i don &apos;t have to hide . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we &apos;re today , in 2011 , our governments like trust , but every right that we &apos;re going to give up for forever .
and we trust , we trust a blind government , a government that we may have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to engage with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the computer .
the first one of the first things were made , and the first idea of a simple idea : the flowering of cement with a thousand times , which fit .
and the very quickly , very quickly , became the most quickly the world &apos;s most quickly in the world .
they put us in the situation to build things bigger than we , buildings , bridges , a stone after the other .
essentially , the most important thing was the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of this .
it was called the &quot; automatically scientific stone . &quot;
and within a few years , lego moved into every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for all possible .
lego has essentially the most powerful , the building industry of the world , and it made a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the same year , the bell was announced the next revolution , the next revolution .
the transistor was a little bit of a little bit of a time that was a world of static , and the a world &apos;s being in the most interactive , and it would be interactive .
as the most powerful , we allow the transistor to build much more complex , more complex , a stone after the other .
but there &apos;s a little bit of a time : the transistor was only for experts .
i personally accept that the building block of our time is to be the experts of our time , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was on the media lab , and i started exploring this idea of the engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing on the ground .
let me show you how they work .
and the electronic organizational , electronic modified , which have a specific function .
they &apos;re a lot of light , light , sound , motor and sensor .
and the best thing about it is that they connect to magnets .
so you can &apos;t put it around .
the rocks are the stone .
green is a copy , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange .
so everything you need to do is connect a blue and a green each other , and you can build it very quickly .
they add a blue one on a green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch between the switch and you have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
take the switch out of a little bit of a time that is here , and you &apos;ve made a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a sudden .
add this kind of thing to a extra effect , and they made a more powerful thing .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and the simple play is actually quite powerful , actually , quite powerful .
instead of doing that , you have to code , or you have to do it , you can get to code with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to accelerate the flashing , or slow down , just turn on this button and it makes the impulse faster or slower .
the idea behind the world &apos;s book is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world in a rock stone .
lights , sound , the engines , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve spread the kids to children and see them playing .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how do you start to understand electronics that you &apos;re in the everyday life and not learn in school .
like a computer company , or why the doors of the brain &apos;s body is going to respond or how a ipod respond to touch .
we also brought up to the most sophisticated .
so we had a designer with no experience in electronic things that started playing with the material as a material .
here we see , with a paper , paper and water bottles , like the way that we &apos;re doing ...
a few weeks ago , we brought up to risd and gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; power , what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a computer company .
but wait , this is really my favorite .
it &apos;s a standstill from play-doh , fear in the darkness .
for these kinds of things , a different material was a different material , electronics was just another material .
and we want to make this material for all available .
so , the open source is open source .
you can go to the website , all the time , and you can make it .
we want to do the world of creators , the inventor , the cuban , because this world , where we live , this interactive world , belongs to us .
so , pull up and start to invent them .
thank you .
