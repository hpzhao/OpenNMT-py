a study of the research for africa has shown that there &apos;s a clear amount of freedom in 28 african countries .
the state should not be in the creation of the creation and services , because it &apos;s inefficient and jealous of this area .
but what it immediately suggests was the variability that we have the economic development of the economic development -- that if the oil prices were high , our economy grew very quickly .
we do the same thing in the world .
and i would like to wish that you would have seen this .
he called it , &quot; massive fatal , &quot; which means that you could kill 100 million people in the next 50 years .
until recently , we didn &apos;t need to know how a vaccine worked exactly .
the main challenge for these two viruses is that they constantly change .
these drugs are not a cure , but they &apos;re a huge triumph of science , because they &apos;re the automated death penalty of a horse at least for those who have access to them .
but you know , the research that has happened to hiv has helped us to do the progress for other diseases .
this was a slow process , and it was dependent on chicken eggs , millions of living chicken eggs .
and despite the radical increase and the vast increase of the e. coli , for example , i &apos;m talking about the two of the time that i &apos;ve just talked about -- look at the supply of life .
so the challenge is a full force .
the question is , why ?
do you think african union is going to organize such a conference ?

the speaker who was here on the stage here , i was a little bit of a , i was conducting mohamed , who was a little bit of the way we had a leader in africa .
by stealing people from suffering to their suffering .
traditionally , africans hate the government -- they hate tyranny .
they decide what they do .
he doesn &apos;t get help from government , and he &apos;s building a second bigger boat .
something that would connect us all together .
scott &apos;s the result of it .
and the challenge for algorithmic filters , these personalized filters , is that they &apos;re going to take these balance over because they &apos;re all going to go to what you &apos;re going to click on .
it &apos;s supposed to be a new way of doing new ideas and to new people and strangers .
and the man said , &quot; well , what &apos;s the next line ? &quot;
i know you &apos;re waiting for other bad people -- i just make fun -- but now , just a quick repetition , and then i &apos;ll show you a new repetition of things about possible solutions .
until the most important in may , it &apos;s going to give a update on version 2.0 , which you can fall directly to buy from the pack of the street .
again , all republicans here , it shouldn &apos;t be about the design of the world .
what really impressed me about the gulf of the gulf is that they &apos;re more competent .

okay , people who call themselves conservative when they really wanted to be really conservative and really , they should send these businesses to the world &apos;s disease .
it &apos;s right and wrong .
and i developed a system to produce medical recklessness .
okay , &quot; i &apos;m more than my genes -- all together .
i didn &apos;t ask you to be a little bit of a time because it &apos;s true , but to remember it .
they contain a molecule that we know as a brain pigmentation .
and that &apos;s just a kind of a design system . it &apos;s a lot smaller than a human being .
well , neurons , as also trees , can grow new branches and lose old ones .
and we can even talk about the most violent .
if you celebrate these numbers , you can make a very simple kind of potential for the brain to be in the brain .
maybe this technology will be able to know that we know ourselves through contaminated and put in our own brain .
he &apos;s working on video videos , and the commercials with his company , the most cosmopolitan .
so we &apos;ve been ready to have a quick experiment to show you this .
ks : no , not yet .
while he did , he noticed a unexpected thing .
ks : so , there &apos;s a matrix of the brain .
ridiculous , right ?
and a few months ago , i sent a link to this guy , eduardo sousa .
a huge scandal for a few weeks .
but he still did .
so his farm is incredible .
and then he found this wild plant , which is the most important .
and then they fly in the circle .
i finally came to try and try and get it before i went .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
what &apos;s the hell is that ?
at least , i think it &apos;s supposed to be .
farmers who rely on nature to find solutions to find answers , rather than nature , instead of nature .
and to change the old fire , it means changing two big stories about oil and electricity that are all ever two of the fossil fuel systems in the air .
our fuel for mobility is about three cars .
you can make it quiet , it &apos;s tougher than titan .
trucks and planes can use realistic hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
even better light and more light and so down the increase to a third .
in about 20 hours of private growth , private solar panels have been cut cheap solar panels without financial losses on their roofs and lower their water .
and what we &apos;re doing is that it &apos;s going to be in about the same cost : about six trillion dollars in internet emissions -- although we buy more of what we have or new nuclear and more , or renewable , more or less centralized .
so , on results , and not incentives , to focus , can be able to focus and find conflict and conflict in the world &apos;s energy solutions .
later , i noticed that what i had eaten was two , two , two of his family .
this simple kind of thing shows that donor donors are in areas where the least kids go to school , not funded schools . and this is what new questions do . achieve aid , who you need most ?
two years ago , on april april , i called my father .
i &apos;m not trying to design the toothbrush .
we remember and can look into the book in my book , that life was born four billion years ago -- four billion point of point two ?
so , i &apos;m not quite sure .
there are risks , there are a trap : the vertical .
you have time to think about it , you have time to talk about art and things like that .
you go back to the future , back , back , back , so .
they all come from families to be a person at home , mostly the mother or grandmother , and they come to their education and their structure here .
we bring them to the right and to turn on the right , so they can tell you about expression and the consequences , if they blow up orders .
let &apos;s go online . &quot;
it &apos;s predicting .
they said , &quot; that &apos;s enough for the long-term .
you can support us . that &apos;s the task of you . &quot;
but i have to have my hotdog .
you can listen and resist .
for example , let &apos;s take the most expensive carbon test .
if you think about the concept of wikipedia , in the whole part of the content , you &apos;ve been doing the largest encyclopedia of the world .
there are many people who have the same dream .
a website was made .
there was no leader .
extremism has become tolerance .
the modern tools of neuroscience show us that what &apos;s happening there is an incredibly complex process .
we can keep our own language apart , but not the stranger .
we checked that by the age of american babies who never heard a second language at the beginning of critical phase .
it may look like a cotton bank from mars .
science on one side has a very rational approach to their environment , while art is usually a emotional approach to its environment .
now i have a live line over here to show you this .
let me demonstrate this over here .
the dalai lama once said , &quot; love and compassion are more competent .
the firemen were the bangs of a small girl who was burned in his body .
it &apos;s part of every human field .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we choose compassion ?
the wound is the wound of maggots .
suppose you like squares , and honestly , who doesn &apos;t like it ?
we start with a computer system and then we put another one apart .
then there was campbell &apos;s favorite , a computer designer .
i said , &quot; he &apos;s already dead .
&quot; did i have a sanitary thing ! &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t get a memo . what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what do you do here ? &quot;
so i went to the lobby , and i saw this indian guy .
marco tempest : if you asked him to deception , he said , &quot; magic is the only job of the job . &quot;
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to show you how close terrorism is connected to our daily lives .
at the time i interviewed the red brigades , i also discovered that their life was not of ideology and politics , but from economic constraints .
i think many people even thought of me in a little bit of a little bit of a time .
but most of all , they went into serious business with organized crime .
this money was in a corporate , and the bar of the bar , and in bar , understanding itself .
nobody wants the most popular ones to control their annual debt and their own their own .
some of you might think , &quot; wait for yourself . you don &apos;t really see how a car designer looks like a car .
clearly , i wanted to leave my favorite , but what i didn &apos;t see was that it &apos;s popular to leave it very uncomfortable , to leave his body care .
and i really learned that the bigger the challenge , the bigger the feeling of a special performance , if you get to the end .
well , i thought the atlantic was big , but the pacific is really very big .
but that wasn &apos;t a business of mine .
it &apos;s this little green disk on the horizon , which is very nervous of the rising level of rising sea level .
we can start to make better , more sophisticated , more sustainable decisions .
so , the savage savage : why i &apos;m going to go through the pacific .
this is the world trade of trade on the cover .
why ? why ? why do you want to do that ?
he doesn &apos;t see any toxic cost . he doesn &apos;t use extra time .
they were able to make it .
and then at the end of the end , it &apos;s about comfort , it &apos;s about the fact that you feel good at places where you didn &apos;t feel good .
and that &apos;s hard when you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i asked myself , how can it be so easy to give up my dreams ?
it &apos;s not so hard to do someone , and one day before school , i said , &quot; oh , you can tell my homework , &quot; and i gave him the wrong answers that i &apos;d read on the night .
we both were brought up in the back of the classroom , so we wouldn &apos;t be able to complain with the very poor .
maybe you brought your home and your teeth , and you never told me , because how can you say you , if all around you , if everybody wants to bury you around you ?
this is french science .
well , then go .
if you look at this truck here ; it &apos;s the largest truck of his way on earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the largest and the fastest growing energy of co2 in canada , and it &apos;s also the reason canada is now the number three in terms of a head of time .
and as a father , i &apos;m not going to imagine what the soul is doing .
by doing that , we take a big part of our biggest health community and replace it with the most greenhouse oil oil of the future .
the most important of their work is the credibility you can buy in every store and spend millions of indian women on your forehead , and it &apos;s a ritual that &apos;s very closely related to the institution of marriage .
and the first was been born in a broadcast , in the closet , and in the closet , they were trained in the closet .
i hope to convince you that complex and complicated are not the same thing .
the most important thing is the one that we want to affect -- the public support for government .
so i proposed to my first tedtalk that we should spend 21 billion hours a week with video games .
just 30 minutes a day , a long improvement of a sense of improvement and the amount of pleasure , the joy of joy .
why a game ?
how could a big game like this have a huge effect in so serious , sometimes have fewer situations ?
there are four types of strength , or resilience to post-traumatic growth , and there are scientifically the audacity of things that you can do every day to build these resilience , you don &apos;t need trauma .
it &apos;s more helpful .
here &apos;s another secret for you : if you shake your hand six seconds long , you &apos;ll be able to get the most expensive in your blood , which is the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; car . &quot;
and in this project , we actually have hundreds of people around the world , and they &apos;re doing that with us . actually , thousands of people involved in this project , many of their different aspects .
and then some people came from chicago and said , &quot; end , the theme of chicago is the theme of the chicago festival , the global warming . we have a chuck gallery , and we want them to fill them with their reef . &quot;
wool and the most important thing is not two concepts that fit good .
neuroscientists asked , &quot; how can i define parallel lines ? &quot;
infinitely . it was done . it &apos;s been done .
so , we have , from wool , the domestic domestic weapon , which is proof that the most famous health community of mathematics is wrong .
and their individual ideas , and their employment with this mathematical method .
this particular recursive property -- the self -- is my opinion of the sacred grail of neuroscience , neuroscience , and eventually we &apos;ll hopefully understand what &apos;s going on .
this person is otherwise at immediate understood and intelligent , but if he sees his mother , he gets his delusion and he says it &apos;s not his mother .
so if this area gets damaged , they lose the ability to recognize faces .
tables and chairs and the chairs -- nothing happens , as opposed to normal people , when i &apos;m showing him a picture of his mother , the most powerful activity is low .
he knows that his arm is not there . nonetheless , it &apos;s a convincing experience , and nonetheless , it &apos;s a convincing experience .
maybe you can do the most uplifting , the spasm in the phantom .
and my pain is gone . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , the last three days i didn &apos;t have a phantom and therefore no longer a dent in the elbow , no confrontation , no , no , no , no , no , the phantom of the car .
the blue is blue , 2.2 is green , another note could be yellow .
that &apos;s the key .
which is kiki , which is buba ?
your favorite thing is to be a little bit of a game where most of us don &apos;t deal with it .
this is kanzi .
none of the things you &apos;re going to see in this video are the most important .
well done .
he learned that when he uses both hands , he &apos;s going to be able to get his specific , big , greater and more powerful charge .
a frame means a hut in the forest .
does he look where the sound comes ?
because we believe it &apos;s not the biology , but the culture .
and some stars die in spectacular kitts that leave these remains .
on the right hand , the gravity is , einstein has explained this .
and beyond it , they get new kinds of change .
it was too early , but he was a moral guide , a sense of scientists , who were worried about control of weapons .
let &apos;s suppose alien creatures have been watching our own point of view , from far outside the cosmos , not only for 40 years , but the whole 10 billion years of the earth &apos;s world &apos;s world .
martin rees asks : is this our last century ?
and it &apos;s going to be worse : &quot; then i would make a picture of it and make a dozen baby .
well , these are students , so they gave a lot of money to things like earrings and makeup .
and then we asked them again , how happy they are .
but enormous different incentives .
these are the main problems in belgium .
the teams that we gave money to spend each other , were in other teams and the dominant ones at the end of the line .
if we hear about the most high , the high oil industry , we often believe that this is one of these most sophisticated conflicts of the middle east , whose roots are as old as the region itself .
ironically , it was a time when the most violent of iran was the peace of iran , and not the destruction of israel .
this is an analogy that focuses on it , the diplomacy serves the diplomacy , is the diplomacy is inevitable .
you can look at certain areas of the brain , or you can look at the different regions and compare them .
the map of port is not as good as you could be , not as good as you could be , not as good as the map of california .
the trick is that .
and the explanation of explaining it was , &quot; he was not a republican . &quot;
this system wants to keep the status quo , even the status quo of a human government .
so it &apos;s not that my theme is the most important thing . that &apos;s not .
we can &apos;t do anything . &quot;
lawrence lessig : we , the citizens , have to go back to the world
for example , some people in this room will thank sputnik to the school of a grant .
it &apos;s on my pen . &quot;
every one is a little bit of a little bit of crazy .
i don &apos;t want to say that the law of entropy is not true .
here in the model , you see the attack of the ice system .
if you see fireflies in north america , they &apos;re like so many things in the united states , and they ignore each other .
every one of their most important region depends on this critical region , the most powerful , which has about 10,000 independent cells , which has a partial rhythm , a electronic rhythm -- a low tension , a low -- to make a low , low -- to make the sound signal a signal .
they were a while in synchrony , but then they were apart .
so i want to share with you a few interviews with people who were opening up to the opening bridge and describe what happened .
now , you don &apos;t usually hold up for a metronome , but we &apos;re all running -- we &apos;re going to go back and go back to run .
im : so , this is just a few tons , so you &apos;re right just going to go .
but the most popular scientist in his area .
i didn &apos;t say what the list was , but she was in a little bit of a spring , and i told them they were going to look for their name , their favorite , or the girls &apos; names .
also , maybe this mainframe , or maybe a computer force , which is not worth economically , a resilience of disease or pests or a different trait that is useful for climate change , and the other doesn &apos;t have .
we &apos;re going to see kids in tv .
so the idea with svalbard was that it &apos;s cold , so you have natural temperatures under freezing .
and if anything happens , you can come and pick it up .
thank you .
watch your body position ! this is not right .
maybe any lady , a lady ? thank you very much .
you &apos;ve tried two concepts -- two in the united states , and one in the russians .
madness ! i have to talk about innovation for a second -- the things that are going to develop , there &apos;s a lot of activity , and then they &apos;re replaced by something else and die .
i can &apos;t tell you when it &apos;s going to go because i don &apos;t want the competition to know my own way .
i mean something really interesting that will happen here .
ok , let &apos;s talk a little bit about the commercial development of the research space .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a few years , he &apos;s ready to give up , but one day he has a epiphany .
institutions are &quot; naked , &quot; and if you &apos;re naked , it &apos;s the consequences .
the fourth meaning of openness and fourth principle is a lot of the time .
the philippines is from the main line .
you know that bees and fish live in school .
all around us , a medical revolution , a revolution , is going to help us defeat some of the worst diseases of our society , including cancer with it .
this is a tumor , dark , gray mass , a weaker mass , a brain , in a brain .
and you can see that the ring of the blood vessel goes away from the treatment .
but the real question is , how good do you work in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add a computer company , it prevents angiogenesis in very effective ways .
but more interesting is coming out of the study that men who have developed the food systems , so the ones that have more tomato sauce , they have less blood vessels , which are actually feeding their cancer .
albert of the scientists once said that &quot; discoveries is to see what all of you saw , and think about what nobody has thought about . &quot;
i &apos;m a series of the discover magazine .
it has to be fun , unlike ordinary problems , which are honest to say , really , very well , as a result of a puzzle .
one is the background of the other .
you can &apos;t do that physically , but you can &apos;t do it on a computer . over the computer , you can go over .
i wanted to make a sequel .
what &apos;s going to be going on ?
so there &apos;s games like &quot; brain texting &quot; for the nintendo , a computer company .
looks like a black character . where is this ?
i really believe that a girl is so powerful , so powerful that we all had to train , not to be that way .
i remember , for example , my father , who was very , very violent , i proposed .
we &apos;re so used to steal girls of the difference , to be a living of their own life that we actually made them in the right way to actually make objects and they have been transformed .
and she looked into the eyes of her baby and she said , &quot; of course i love my baby . how could i love my baby ?
when we were there , she did a ritual where she was taking girls who were donated , with her families .
and i &apos;m going to be on your side of your life . &quot;
i love that i don &apos;t take the things easy .
why should you get rid of me , you want to go out ?
so , in the actual process , all six teenagers said , and they were doing the most expensive , they had made them through the photo photo .
but the incident was in the middle of january , on the northern hemisphere , to seven o &apos;clock at night .
this is 10 feet away .
and what does this example show -- what is important to keep us in memory ?
he was a very religious man .
i got a college and i traveled through africa , where i asked people why they were building fractals , what a great job is when you can get it .
and that &apos;s going to be on some villages to the smallest level .
it &apos;s not really mathematical knowledge .
he said , &quot; if i lived in the jungle , i would just use long , because it &apos;s very fast and it &apos;s very cheap .
and odd , odd , odd .
we have a solar system in ghana .
the bad news is : it &apos;s the bad news .
instead of turning friends or their relatives , they looked at david &apos;s workplace .
today , agile development is applied to a hundred countries , and it &apos;s going to go up to the air industry .
fear of oranges lose . beds .
we &apos;re going to put some rules on them and hold them out .
the conversation will run better . &quot;
now , as i was going to go back tonight to come here , i started to get my daughters to come up .
and we developed 10 talks .
i was a teenager when i first read &quot; anna &quot; and the famous first set of paper : &quot; all happy families are identical to each other .
i want to show you how to look at something invisible .
if i put this into the water , you see a silver ball , and this is the most expensive thing that the water is holding from the water of the ocean , it keeps dry .
and plato with all the young boys in his cave . sweeney : ow ...
i &apos;m going to show you .
but tesla &apos;s success was not a gift .
one thing i want to be clear is that not all the neurosurgeon carry out of the neurosurgeon .
we can turn them up or turn them down , or turn it up .
he &apos;s one of five children .
i showed you that we can apply it to the circuits of the mood of the mood .
we &apos;re in understanding what these circuits are and what the brain cells are responsible for for the clinical cues and symptoms of these diseases .
evolution is actually more like a type of type of type of engineer as an engineer .
that &apos;s enough !
what we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human being , like richard , or a cockroach or a therapist or a a servant that is the relative of these feather in the same way that we &apos;ve seen before .
okay . the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , right ? it &apos;s incredible , students have tried , and they couldn &apos;t say it .
he &apos;s doing this with a laser glue .
what we do is we take the hair as a role model , and imagine with another colleagues from berkeley .
and that &apos;s what the married pride of childhood leaders , two thirds of death , but only one third of the purple women .
on monday , i left san francisco , my favorite , and flew to this conference .
and we go out at the end , look at us and say , &quot; how did it go ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous study of harvard business school in school , a woman named heidi krishnan .
and i &apos;ve been able to get my hand back and i fell in all the other women and then have been asking more questions , just by men . &quot;
a woman approached me about this and i looked at it -- she looked something young .
thank you .
they don &apos;t do it as regular as they should , but they do .
so not fear was the defining factor .
but it &apos;s true in the middle of the black .
i want to talk about this in the following , thinking about how we spread more energy data , how we get information .
so , you &apos;re in clean , clear language , and that works .
we tell them all right , it &apos;s all right , that it &apos;s good .
this patient is about 50 , so we can say pretty much how big its risk is to get prostate cancer .
they don &apos;t need the standard level of the audience in this room .
and this bee certainly had been , &quot; i &apos;m going to get to get these flower , these flower , i &apos;m going to go to the nectar and then go off . &quot;
and if you talk about nature that is a writer , what is the idea of the world &apos;s idea ?
well , we &apos;re all equally sophisticated .
the only technology here is the cheap , very new , a car car , which is actually , i could close a subset of 10 , in 15 minutes .
if a computer designer , the grass is going to get this altitude of this altitude , and it &apos;s happening immediately .
and now i say , i want to build a layer of games on top of the world , but that &apos;s not quite true , because it &apos;s already in development . it &apos;s happening .
if not , it &apos;s a shame . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
come to a certain time , you get your beverages half to half .
and then you can really reach up to different ways .
and it &apos;s powerful .
and the main community is a public dynamic that tries to find the best news , the most exciting stories .
we &apos;ve talked about this last time for a few years ago .
you also see , if i turn this around -- hopefully i don &apos;t get the world too much .
you can see , here &apos;s what it started .
this is one of our engineers .
so , caliban , who should have taught the students who should teach the law of the execution , just as a hobby of the execution , just as a hobby .
raise your hands .
it makes it a place where it makes fun to work .
and so that &apos;s what we &apos;re working on , and we even have people who are excited about it and crazy enough that they &apos;re working on it , that &apos;s really their goal .
thank you .
what brunel said , as he said , was going to reach his passengers , was the experience of the landscape .
what does life make easier , more pleasant ?
so , for the part of the world , they &apos;re doing this by building a great new tool , using the basement of one of their hospitals .
today , the industrial systems of time have been blowing up and they have become part of the present problem .
and as brunel can , we can do a lot of time , and we have a bigger effect .
from my persistence , the waiter gave himself the waiter with his bosses .
mark blackmore and i tried to have a series of studies , right ?
yet , it &apos;s exactly what the american paradigm requires .
but for the eastern eastern eastern koreans , the availability of all these kind of dna was on the market like a car form .
the americans themselves discover that unlimited choice in the theory seem to be more attractive than in practice .
the parents would say more things like , &quot; noah was just for so short , but he taught us so much .
robert frost once said this , &quot; it &apos;s poetry that &apos;s lost in translation . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant video of pink . &quot;
the three problems have one in common : they &apos;re a social problem that &apos;s controlled by natural forces .
so thank you very much .
it &apos;s supposed to replace competition .
and then we build a more sophisticated , which we can test the supply of the machines , and so we can get very , very quickly .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that the most best thing that the most important thing is , was the best , not being understood as a computer engineer , but as a symbol of motion .
the nuclear weapon enters the stage .
and then the 92 nuclear power that would provide the energy , the rest of los angeles .
then you take it and you put it on the screen of your television , and it &apos;s on the outside of the inside , just like that .
if you replace the word , or the internet , it &apos;s very right that its perception is now very , very well , and let &apos;s hear it in a very minute .
i think it was this exchange that led to computers .
ph : i hope you understand how to do this .
finally , the race has led to momentum , when the phone company is going to be pulled out .
mm : because there &apos;s a role to do something .
they produce things for 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute .
and where tv has been built , what &apos;s built , a very exciting new way of communication , and we have the association of two industries and a new way of thinking about it .
this is a spanish architect and designers .
color can undermine simple blocks , simple materials : when i go through new york , i think .
it gave me a commitment -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco and we all talk about , and we &apos;re building a few installations .
the use of the city for public space is important , is more important , almost an international model .
even the parts of the plane had french words .
he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s more girls there . &quot;
and that was , after all , i was , after some of the most educated and more competent , design of the chair i &apos;m going to show you .
he said , you have one of the new , better chairs .
or they &apos;re moving up to the course of the position .
but i knew , but i was looking around the experience , and when i was looking around the office , there was no one who would come to the idea of any of the idea , and they would be able to make a sense of the head , to turn them into a position of view .
and fever has spread in the street .
two days ago or yesterday , i can &apos;t remember that , i &apos;ve read in a more mature , i read that the first time of time , has been the first time of about 52 , about 52 , and about 400 , of course , with about 400 .
we need something that was really , really , really , the state of the state , so he doesn &apos;t spread the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : males hit females , lots of young boys .
so , the biggest problem is not our biggest problem .
&quot; why now ? &quot; why here ?
and most of the time i &apos;m barely remove , even though i &apos;m a full-time addict .
look at the data available .
now , our mobile phones can now build a story of our own field .
bill mandelbrot : your health depends on where you live .
this is my grandfather .
it &apos;s the simple reason that nobody else talks about it .
as the dawn explains , plants are moving phosphorus from the ground .
here &apos;s a remarkable article from a remarkable article from &quot; nature &quot; , which is the discussion of the phosphorus crisis .
eighty percent of it is being lost as i mentioned .
and instead of a dose of 100 percent , we take one of 25 percent .
we have a working technology and one that is going to be in the long-term use of the world &apos;s use of the world that we &apos;re going to move on the world &apos;s most sophisticated .
and he was a called a &quot; the name of &quot; he looked at all the most competent and mutations to find rules and laws instead of looking at the norms .
and in this example , you see that the individual steps are going to repeat , but they &apos;re doing it without being a more sophisticated .
as an architect , i think only about relationships between the parts and all of the stuff , but in terms of product materials , it &apos;s always becoming more about business .
we were in the level of the building of the building where we could build the five separate towers , but they should all be in the 60 floor of a single mass of a mass .
let &apos;s go back again , a few years later , in 2003 , and we &apos;ll see that this landscape is honest in the middle of the landscape , rather than rainforests .
the difference is mostly in the desert in the desert , or maybe in the desert , or maybe in the desert , whatever you want .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that have been solved , and now the air is .
we &apos;ve doubled the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world just by fertilizers that causes huge problems to bring the water quality in the water water , in rivers , lakes and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the most important thing for the most important health care system .
but we can do that and there &apos;s opportunities in it .
irrigation is the biggest largest market on the top of the mountain .
need to work together .
so what is this actually that is in system system ?
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
the whole system system is not saving taxes .
we interact with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biological diets to amplify these kinds of things -- muscles .
so this is what this looks like .
here we are , or cut the nerve , from little parts of the brain , and they were giving us the other hidden , and we had the other hidden , signal , two other people who have our hand -- signal .
ak : it works good .
but i can &apos;t sit in an electrode and say , &quot; there . &quot;
and that &apos;s our goal -- a bit clinically , to carry a bit more clinically .
this is jesse and he &apos;s pushing a laser .
so thank you .
sub-saharan africa is largely , because there are 22 million people with hiv living , which are significantly 70 percent of the 30 million people who are infected in the world .
governments have to create effective environmental development for ethical aspects in clinical trials , which are being approved in the different developing countries , and the government &apos;s programs are being launched by the government and the most common of the study .
the fundamental problems we face are a too high consumption and too many people .
so they &apos;re all concerned about the criteria that people usually prefer .
so you see this current , which goes north -- the most expensive in this case -- the way to go to the galapagos , and this is the most important , the most important , the most important , the most important one , the way to the galapagos .
we also know that not only is it threatened , but the same ones and other people are in the same way .
now i want to show you that penguins moved in in the field of education .
turbo came up with his tentacles to pat his tentacles . we put it in and he comes into this .
and then there &apos;s another one that comes out of very comfortable .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we haven &apos;t solved : our fundamental political geography .
the two parts of the line are a pretty long frontier .
again , as in the case of mongolia , china has not been dumped russia . it &apos;s it .
for the countries , china reduces its carbon production , so that the most violent and cambodia can be treated , and it &apos;s also been sold by the street to china .
what i want to introduce you to here is i call a day day .
these two arrows form a bow , a bow of a plastic bow and other infrastructure that connects west bank to gaza .
thank you very much .
so what &apos;s next ? how does the future of the european union look like ?
53 countries and far the most of the suspects on the side of the suspects .
this dream is the time .
it &apos;s bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
okay .
and the hormone receptor is expanding growth .
so how can a hormone end up the speed of aging ?
we think insulin and stimulation are hormones that are active in particular , in a lot of times -- in good times -- if food is available , and not much stress in the environment exists .
we don &apos;t know the details about how it works , but we know that foxo genes have an impact on people &apos;s life expectancy .
basically , you could change genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process of which i &apos;ve been talking about what &apos;s going on in the worm very quickly , a different normal , human being , like a bird , so that the bird can live much longer .
you will never see such a collection , because nike wants you to buy your shoes .
they all show heroes , the most popular ones .
it &apos;s like trying to run against a long-term movement .
this view is that many of the most powerful things that prozac are essentially changing as prozac in the brain is actually changing the chemistry of the brain as if it was the brain of a chemical soup .
and my colleague &apos;s colleague , seymour &apos;s favorite fellow believes that .
and what we found is that a mutant , much longer , needed a lot longer to go back to the most cosmopolitan , and when we were changing genes , the gene was able to find a role .
so this question has been asked for a long time , but we can actually test it in the fly .
so , mosquitoes find us in the dark by taking us out of the dark . they smell us .
it &apos;s just that you see it , this is the cheese .
people even told me that now they &apos;re going to be bitten by mosquitos .
in the lab .
and every time i felt the fates of the eyes of the eyes .
and as a result , fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells .
as we talk , about 11,000 clinical trials are going to study the use of stem cells for the growth of stem cells .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angels in the world , not just in our country : venezuela . in our entire world .
so what happens if that &apos;s not happening ?
but here you see what &apos;s really going on .
i can &apos;t tell you about it , because i stopped at the headline .
so , the experimenter : what they don &apos;t know about marriage .
but how ?
it &apos;s even better . it seems that we can make this receiver , with the help of materials that are encoded in dna .
the animal jumps , it &apos;s spreading its wings , it &apos;s floating , but it can &apos;t really go , because the fly is caught between two glass .
for a intelligent creature like our fly , this rule is not thrown in stone , but it &apos;s changing as the animal learns by experience .
through many of these experiments , we were able to revolutionize identity of the critic to 12 cells .
there &apos;s a few ideas in the world &apos;s business and the artificial intelligence , as you could do , but we still haven &apos;t solved one example of how intelligent behavior from the physical interaction is in the living matter .
here &apos;s 4shbab , or actually , a very eager one of 4shbab .
ed : well , tb : okay . so , a little bit of a bit of time , please , a little bit more to the middle .
and i know from the experience of the experience that hospitals can be a very dangerous place .
here &apos;s a picture of my favorite legacy of legacy .
i &apos;m telling you , this kind of concern , which is all , of your goals , will be the most important change that we &apos;re going to see in our lifetime , the most common transformation that we &apos;re going to see in our lifetime .
they don &apos;t stick like velcro , or glue , or glue .
here we have the robot .
marc ornish built the most painful news system .
what would happen if you put on the bottom of the paper and it came out a little bit of a paper , or we would shake the sheet ? &quot;
and so , you &apos;ve got it . and it &apos;s doing this .
of course , completely different than you would see in a nanotube .
we &apos;re going to look at the rising level of sea level .
and i would say , people who work in the ocean are working on the oceans , and think about the goals , we should be a lot lower .
this is the ship that i was the last three months in antarctica .
when this ice rises up , the sea level is up six feet .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news is for the corals of the galapagos islands .
your relationship is the water water .
but then at the end , you see the most popular in black .
we have very interesting possibilities that we have in the atmosphere of the atmosphere in the atmosphere , and we &apos;ve always done this with a lot of the time , but in this case we go back 20 million years .
and this is the task that einstein has asked : trying to figure out how gravity works .
einstein already had room and time , biases and curves to be used to describe gravity .
but deep in the structure of space , the idea could be more dimensions than we see there .
and as the strings of a cello can vibrate differently , they can also absorb strings in different patterns .
not yet .
is this just an interesting mathematical construction building that may be able to explain some of the most powerful qualities of the world , or can we actually demonstrate these extra dimensions ?
so we have two plates with colored dots on it .
now , can you see the predator , which is that it &apos;s going to attack it ?
and what &apos;s true for sensory information is generally to all the information .
and we look at about 30 seconds of what &apos;s quite a hammer in a 18 minutes long .
why ? because if the orange in this shadow is actually in the shadow , and the same amount of light would reflect on your eye , like the orange outside of the shadow , you would have to reflect more -- just laws of physics .
how do you know that ?
and she comes into the hive , finds a blank piano and put it on the hive -- and that &apos;s honey .
he finds him . madness , or ?
do you agree ? yes ?
there &apos;s no right or wrong here .
in 2010 , in new york , not so much .
we &apos;re also a storyteller of storytellers .
now some things : understanding security , the risks , the dangers , the statistician , how they work .
but in a modern and complex world , they need models to understand the many risks we are facing .
think of cancer , avian flu , swine flu , sars .
there was no new insight , but less fear .
and there &apos;s another cognitive bias : i call it a little more important by accept data that we have to take on the data and the data that we have to deny our own data .
i know a different group of other group , if my airplane was safe to fly .
this is the people .
and he was found in the near stanford .
they had good proportions with their teachers , students .
let me ask you some questions to find out whether that is a good choice . &quot;
i took anyone to sit in , and to save them , or save them , to save me as volunteer , but i found that nobody did something .
we opened the first section of 2009 .
robert ebert : building a park in the sky
and groups were often called &quot; terrorists &quot; .
they need a process of a process that can handle the core of this very complicated society with its problems .
it &apos;s about the first time in the history of arab world , and we &apos;re probably looking at a revolution in the arab world .
paradox about this is that this was a decade ago , and it was a main number of reasons .
and at once , ngos are not calling their candidates anymore on the streets -- but they took them into negotiations , part because they were the victims of these weapons .
thank you very much for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think that &quot; the &quot; is &quot; a good thing . &quot;
so this was a completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little crazy to work on a new new computer .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this strange rich man in the movie ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the last day comes out the sun , the coyote , they come straight to the boat , and it &apos;s fantastic .
i &apos;m going to give you a little nervous here because i &apos;m going to tell you a few radical things about how we should think differently about cancer to a audience that many people have to do with cancer a lot more than i do .
the part of the genome we can read is the list of ingredients .
it finds a huge amount of information in genetics by simply comparing the genetic similarity .
and i , &quot; okay . at least this guy is fine . &quot;
so we &apos;re actually measuring each other &apos;s disease as a own .
if you have malaria , we give them a little bit of time , or some of them .
where we really got to get it is the process that &apos;s just going on , and that &apos;s the level of the most important activity on the level of why the body doesn &apos;t even do it ? &apos;
danny hillis : cancer through proteomics
they &apos;re all members in tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to give up these people .
because at stage three , most of us are .
this is their lobby .
there was no plan . never before anybody did this .
in fact , martin luther king jones was in stage three .
so i &apos;m sitting here in this chair , and i do nothing . &quot;
and suddenly they brought out the most popular and tried to figure out , &quot; how do we ask the population of sub-saharan africa ? &quot;
automatically , we &apos;re going to get the little pieces up the plastic .
this one or a trivial cliche that were designed to do just so much to design the control for the ground to the ground , which they are , were not considered a permanent building .
they &apos;re going to be the stability and security that can give the lap of an uncle , compare them to the legendary construction of a football niece in high heels .
but from my perspective , compassion has a problem .
and it &apos;s the most important form of the brain &apos;s form .
i can &apos;t really explain it , and he doesn &apos;t .
stories like this , sign like this , are practical aid in a world that will be longing to bring compassion , the ones of suffering , the ones that could prevent us otherwise .
gandhi was also a really profound person .
and the first day , our favorite day , our main team gave us a head , and we taught us our motto that we had to talk to every day for the rest of the summer .
this is one of two or three of their known ones .
here are some examples .
it turns out we can &apos;t be part of a group without a single point of view of others .
so that &apos;s the world that we live in today .
and so i &apos;m trying to learn from my grandfather &apos;s example to my own own art .
okay , number two : go to the wild .
and imagine that , you know , a inner picture : i was born in a very small village in mexico , in the , unfortunately , very , very , very , very high , and my parents had no higher school education .
and so we think that all of the changes that are happening is that we &apos;re now going to face incredible opportunities .
it &apos;s an initiative that is on simple , leaving , and the solutions to the solutions .
we &apos;ve sent 30 different technologists now to have 18 different categories , and we were able to connect millions of people , in the quest to learn what this particular sphere needs and demand .
and my father came to me and said , &quot; you know , i remember you , i remember that every generation must make it better than the previous one .
i know many people who are very clever and yet say , &quot; why can i not solve my problem ? &quot;
i started with a different family in 1980 .
don &apos;t you believe that we have the responsibility , the conservation environment , to take serious ? &quot;
i still drive the same four years old , as well .
but that &apos;s not a good life .
this is what he &apos;s praying .
whether you believe or not , it doesn &apos;t make any difference for me now .
so he said , &quot; what are you going to do in your hand ? &quot;
what &apos;s that in your hand ? &quot; i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball , and this basketball represents your identity , which you &apos;re .
when my kids were small , i always went into her room , sat on her bed and looked at my children .
it &apos;s less than i had a little bit of time -- i was doing three to 10 million -- but still it &apos;s a very significant number .
in a village , we then have 100 laptops , every one of the different collection of 100 books , so that the village suddenly has 10,000 books .
right , the famous chinese character for the world &apos;s imagination .
they answer the question : how does it feel that you &apos;re concerned about the wrong ?
we &apos;re learning that really bad lesson .
think about it for a moment , as it is , to feel right in the right .
and unlike all the other animals , we &apos;re obsessed with trying to figure out .
and i have to tell you that i thought i write this incredibly nerdy book about a subject that all hate , for a audience that would never be there .
the effect of this is not just a basic force of wheat , but mountains of grains .
1986 , she came from vietnam to america .
the answer was , &quot; that &apos;s even worse . &quot;
our main age sank to a third of the average in our industry , and in the five years of the dotcom , our most sophisticated people have tripled .
bhutan , for the ones that don &apos;t know , is the youngest democracy of the world , only two years old .
it &apos;s actually that we &apos;re in the west , and the happiness is , as good as happiness , it would be a thing that we would have to capture , a thing , or maybe several things that we have to get .
and we &apos;re asking 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s the simplicity .
what we really need to learn as leaders is that we can influence the production of production by creating the right conditions to live our employees .
bl : okay . one , two , three .
under deck , you &apos;ll tell the inner system , moving you . but the eyes are moving in the way , and say , &quot; i &apos;m silent . &quot;
amy , you come up to the top ?
the method : what did you do ? the result : what have you noticed ?
i just read one .
real scientific education should be the people who are supposed to give them a voice and to express them , so amy should have the last word in this short story .
poor people have no opportunity to have this opportunity .
we went back to the 1970s .
and to come along , we need to realize that the principle of a quantum system doesn &apos;t just hurt the species that we talked about , but our society is wasting our society .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure somebody has been wondering , &quot; yes , great stuff up there -- but how do i get up there ?
i was a professor at the university of the university of december , and i got a lot of attention to this , and that allowed me to fund the launch of the program .
we have eight motors in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart , they fall apart and they end up here .
i mean , people are wondering if cell phones are safe .
you have a coil .
because , remember the original idea of dr. kamen : the most popular mobile phone of his wife .
and for those who can &apos;t read it : &quot; it seems like it &apos;s like a kind of wireless technology . &quot;
green or natural media , which is not going to be a little bit of time , is a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the existing realities of our bodies .
first , a computer company , it interacts with a little bit of the , the &quot; death death death . &quot;
and only months later , i learned who he was really .
i &apos;m looking for a cure .
i say , &quot; hold him alive when you can . &quot;
even with this kind of paper in our hands , we have the hope of the hope of the hope .
it &apos;s a feature .
suddenly he knows that he was defeated .
to allow you to allow you to do this , we have to put them back on the wheel .
we &apos;re going to do the area , we &apos;re pushing it , we sent people into , we send the buildings out in the inside , the most sophisticated , and we helped the first time for the first time , looking at the search and saving .
if i do this , i don &apos;t lose the original detail . in the contrary , i could write history here .
you are withheld by the public opinion .
that &apos;s not particularly good .
and what about this is a democracy .
here &apos;s the question : what country is getting better , china or india ?
because the indian man has a benefit in things of two years of life to the indian woman .
what political change is , they &apos;ve introduced them to be a lot of the time .
china , i think , still has some pretty significant , basic foundations -- especially in terms of social capital , public health , a sense of equality that is not there in india .
it was a place where people with the states and with various kinds of dna and they were going to be a different place .
and now , you have the problem that you &apos;ve spent the whole money , to help help with this advanced electronics in these countries and now all of it is useful .
a bit messy environment , where many ideas were made , where people were more , interesting , interesting , more interesting , more interesting , people .
about a decade ago , a wonderful computer company went to the name howard , and i read darwin &apos;s notebook , and he read darwin &apos;s notebook from this period .
they &apos;re going to be in their colleagues , but everybody said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think about it .
is it the other way to go the other way ?
in the 1970s , the one percent of the national income in the united states took over the united states .
many of these political factors can be summarized in the category , &quot; capitalism , &quot; political changes , the one group of good interconnected , helping a group of good things to help , but actually nothing to bring us to the rest of us .
as you can see right , as you can see , globalization and technological revolution can create this global sovereignty , it &apos;s much harder to judge all of it .
so they invest unprecedented amounts of time and resources to train their children .
we created the modern consumer technology .
this is his little hand .
we &apos;re all going to die .
that was a huge disappointment for us , because we believed in a new progression .
i even believe that in places like oregon , where you &apos;re taking attention to the treatment , you can eat a toxic dose , just half a percent of people ever did it .
so , long speech short , you get to canada .
but i heard about cancer as the most of our time , as the most good and the bad thing that they were doing , so how good and bad ones together ?
some of the articles went to say that skeletal muscle muscle is resistant to cancer , and beyond , not only against cancer , but it &apos;s about getting metastases out of skeletal muscle .
16 percent ! that &apos;s where these are these migratory tumors in skeletal muscle , but only 16 percent of the actual metastases -- which is that skeletal muscle may be able to control angiogenesis , capable of controlling the tumors that are able to put that blood vessels for themselves .
this is a very far idea of this , but i really believe that it &apos;s possible .
and then i left my translator .
she was the girl who was in the breaks of her team for her team .
and i wrote a letter on the top of my best friends in atlanta , georgia , who had a 11 year-old son .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot; i asked the translator .
so the two came to lunch , and we were thrown out of the restaurant .
he had children from all korea , and he found families for them .
they have a lot of time about the dictionary .
so i open the window , look out , and look how fire from the highway of the hotels shoot into the altitude . the hotel burns .
so we ran into the bathroom , and we took towels and they took the faces of our faces and the children .
and the adoption is , a year . what does it need for so long ?
this is their main test .
this is sydney , which is going to be three years old .
but there was no evidence .
there are little planets , there are bigger planets , there &apos;s big planets , ok .
but there &apos;s a lot more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something that depends on the planet ?
and the deeper thing that &apos;s happening is that the science is that science is , as we know it , to define life .
okay , let &apos;s say this is the size of the fame universe , with all the galaxies , all the stars , all right , from here .
thank you very much .
look : as uganda falls down and zimbabwe goes down , russia goes down to one percent .
you find the highest hiv in the world in african countries , and yet you find in senegal , here , the same rate as in the united states .
look at kenya .
it could be something else , which is the transmission more common .
we know about the favorite of the ages of the world &apos;s favorite billion people ever .
that wasn &apos;t just an economic story .
and the result is even larger divergence in a shorter period than it was in germany .
it &apos;s just the same with institutions .
you just have to give me to food . &quot;
he was wrong .
now , i want to end with three questions , and i want to end with the future billion , shortly in 1974 , if the united states is losing a economy in china .
no , we &apos;re probably going to be able to stack up , regardless of the vast sea , which we put in , regardless of the signs that we &apos;ve lost our work and other parts of our historical field .
niall , thank you .
there are many kinds of spider silk .
silk silk is almost entirely entirely composed .
the fibers that can make a single spider is already quite diverse .
also , the very high potential is a high potential because of your ability to get to the world .
what i want to pay is not the mermaid mermaid , so it may be so beautiful , but it &apos;s on the photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there are more photos . there are more photographers .
that sounds alien in our ears , but what happens is that 80 percent of the mammography has contributed much .
the first thing that happens when you &apos;re a problem is that the first goal of the institution is immediately changing by what the goal of the institution is .
the inventor don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states trying to figure out whether bloggers are journalists or not .
it was created by creating their own , the use of many of these tools , and no , the intelligence agencies , the intelligence agencies , the same work for the attacks in the last week .
you have a lot of time , which is probably for us , which is probably the healthiest part of bread or the fibers , because it &apos;s just full of fibers , because it &apos;s made of fibers .
everything is on its place . first level .
we call it &quot; the &quot; road &quot; .
but let &apos;s look at the different steps , under the most important connections , where the possible connections is to a deeper level -- my search is about the answer to the question , &quot; what &apos;s so special about bread ? &quot;
this is transformation , two different things .
and if you &apos;re shaped , you go back to prove to prove that you &apos;re alive and create character .
if you make this bread , you can use any kind of a bunch of a million of them .
it will become a kind of a kind of a kind of conceptual , as we work through this talk .
it takes very , very long , to write these scores , and at the time i work on a piece that &apos;s 180 pages long , and that &apos;s a big part of my life and i &apos;m going to get hair .
it &apos;s done by brian &apos;s &quot; a remarkable artist , &quot; which is an extraordinary artist .
you have a little taste of the song .
what we did -- betty mandelbrot , one of my students , and i -- we gave the babies two dishes with food : a bowl with a little bit of a little bit of the broccoli , and a bowl of a little bit of a computer company .
i mean , last , when we look at babies , they seem pretty useless .
and our babies and children are far longer dependent on us than the babies every other species .
the most important thing is to change the hypothesis .
now there are two things that really interesting about it .
boy : that &apos;s why .
our consciousness about this thing is extremely bright and vivid , and everything else will be like dark .
&quot; babies and small children are like the research and the human species , &quot; the psychologist , &quot; the psychologist alison gopnik . &quot; and the research is exploring how babies do work and make decisions .
if i could borrow you a little bit for a little demonstration to show the difference -- because it &apos;s actually quite trivial .
and then you repeat this process and again , and again , until something is coming out -- in this case , the character is going to go out like me , just walking straight .
what we really wanted was the whole human body .
you can &apos;t do that far .
here &apos;s a couple of simple scenes that he &apos;s going to get .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we did it yet .
some studio , our software has already been doing that to do exactly that , and we &apos;ll have a few of our most important things to see in a few big stages of life .
we thought he just would just hold the balance .
here you learn to go to the street -- most of you hopefully know .
but i have to say , i &apos;ll never forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i &apos;m convinced art and creativity are essential to develop empathy .
if you &apos;re ever lonely , you write a new york times column , you get hundreds of emails . most of which i &apos;ve been doing today , followed by frustration .
some stories are just classic , and yet , so it &apos;s so naughty .
it mutates . nobody ever got it .
there &apos;s a border that we don &apos;t want to cross . what is the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want to create a new blank document in word -- that could be able !
but i think there are actually two microsoft microsoft .
the other products were supported by microsoft with an open standard , rather than apple &apos;s standard .
and i &apos;m going to write , if someone writes a little bit of a card -- what &apos;s going on every day -- i say , &quot; screw me . &quot;
but when i looked at the most popular technologies , nanotechnology , the other , and other things in the world , i made a very big concern about the most important thing , i &apos;m very worried about the most important .
and to limit the danger of these new things , we have to end the ability to give you the ability to get the access to the only access to the problem of the individuals .
i think the challenge we are -- i &apos;m very sure that this is going to happen -- the challenge is , are we going to develop this , and we &apos;re going to develop this kind of thing with the background that &apos;s going to apply us from this device ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , for example , you have all sorts of incredible properties , you all have different properties .
and to give you a sense of the last one of the small , and then we &apos;re going to get a hundred million dollars , that &apos;s a little bit of a remarkable thing for us , so that &apos;s a pretty remarkable thing for us .
and if you take the concept of insurance , you can have a much more powerful component of the market -- the forces of the market -- to deliver feedback .
12 years ago , caves began to be too amazing , and i shifted my research into this direction .
so wonderful and grim things .
there &apos;s ice under the surface .
so they &apos;re a kind of a living form of life .
it &apos;s actually so much energy for biology in this cave that there &apos;s actually a big number of rules .
we can see them .
we noticed a few years ago that caves have been used many traits that were used by the people and other organisms used to be living as habitat .
whenever you get a goal , to the point of view , to the kind of way , you have to be a certain way of being on yourself .
and so it &apos;s also at archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
it was made by it , and it was suffering under tremendous amounts of water .
that means before we could start to digitize the most popular , we had to take the book apart .
and this is what it looks like .
but by flying the electrons around , they &apos;re going to go off a piece of steel .
this was a bad idea , because philip of nigerians had a son named alexander of the great , and they lost the battle of the world &apos;s battle .
because the institutions are now breaking their data with a little more sophisticated and so more .
the original owners of the bottle was one of the most mysterious century in the 18th century .
i asked myself , 160 dollars for what ?
she has four balconies .
a little bit of a pattern is that many of these things come from japan -- they &apos;ll notice it .
i mean , a computer designer , a toilet , a toilet .
there was a object that i couldn &apos;t get into the finger , and that was the northern hemisphere .
and i can &apos;t -- call my taste of a football -- so it &apos;s not necessarily important that i wasn &apos;t impressed , but i wasn &apos;t the only one there with this reaction .
at the beginning of this year , a virtual asteroid sold from a virtual real dollar .
the really interesting thing about virtuality , is that you can measure it .
well , i could develop a game called the name of the name of just a million pies , or a thousand pies .
if it &apos;s real boxes , we can &apos;t do much , but in a game we say , &quot; ok . &quot;
this is absolutely crucial and virtuality in it .
and i want to tell you a quick story , 1999 -- there was a video game called the video game .
it &apos;s about how individual engagement can be transformed by the psychological and neurological insight that we get when we see people playing .
it &apos;s a kind of conceptual plaque , which is called a slave acceptance .
i &apos;m ellen , and i &apos;m totally obsessed with food .
there are certainly hunger in america , 49 million people and almost more of the children .
and their farms are also big .
it &apos;s the 30 anniversary of the grain of the grain of grain , and the big bang , from chicken mcnuggets , the most cosmopolitan of the chicken , the most important and the way we &apos;ve been studying agriculture international .
this is a very popular one that i &apos;ve got two years ago , which was one of the largest projects i &apos;ve ever been involved in .
but i &apos;m going to just just give you the way to the beginning of the process , three very reactive talks .
if we &apos;re so good in what we &apos;re doing , what we should do is to create an architectural manifestation that &apos;s completely disconnected by the most vulnerable and the jargon of the boat ?
the architectural endeavor was called the , simple , simple .
and this is the real cure of the trouble .
the second technology we were using , we use things that are familiar with the most of the opera opera .
here you see the most expensive configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk about how you &apos;re spreading stories , and you &apos;re going to be able to get into something .
one of these projects is about a year old .
this is the images that are automatically created .
as long as i was awake , i had the camera to go off .
you can see a timeline that shows you the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s a lot of time . well , keep on .
a high-speed member of a computer worker .
an historian , a farmer , farmer .
what if you found the truth for just a year , what would you do the next 35 years of your life ?
money , money and a business is the indian of the indian .
while anesthesia was told you that he wanted to be in the process , and he gave me about a little more of the time of life .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , i have no benefits .
with the hand , it &apos;s almost impossible , except in the way , and then the communication is limited .
very funny people , if lol means that .
you don &apos;t do that in the middle .
if someone had seen a black board of 1993 , the most different one would have been a little different for the time of &quot; love story , &quot; but he &apos;d have understood what was there .
i &apos;m about the most popular , i wanted to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you can see my work next week , and also in the nursing fashion community in the street , in the nursing fashion lab .
afghanistan doesn &apos;t represent existential threat for global security .
and the same thing is true for the troops .
instead , there was a fee of a symbiotic optimism .
diplomats dig in in the street .
and finally , we have to understand that the secret of what we were doing in bosnia and kosovo , the secret of our success to the great part of our humility -- was in the careful , in the very careful way of doing our instincts .
rory , she mentioned libya to finally .
so here you see two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger to show you what it looks like .
there are also also a lot of plastic that &apos;s been deleted , but if you &apos;re going to get these online types of water , that &apos;s a different kind of engineering .
the most important thing . this is a hard problem for reasons that i &apos;m not going to be .
there &apos;s another one , very interesting connection , and this is that what you want to do is to lead valuable information on a very bad phone .
so , i think it &apos;s got the fearless food that we probably can make to make things .
and we decided that we should not think about the cost of the cost , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book that says , &quot; what &apos;s the heart of the brain ? &quot;
so we have to ask ourselves why .
but nevertheless , you don &apos;t interact with people who are not like you .
so we can think of things like the most popular .
i &apos;m kidding , but only half , if i say that you will not believe that you &apos;re going to be able to do with a missing limb , and mri and the previous cat , mri and the street &apos;s name .
then bell is turning on his students .
within a few years in the late 19th century , the doctor was introduced , and the doctor was trying to make a diagnosis , the most prolific , the most prolific .
between the perception of the patient and the doctors in terms of the best medical care system , a real contradiction is a real contradiction .
another experience i did in texas , before i went to stanford , was influenced me .
the bad news : we don &apos;t know . look at it ? you can do that , you can do that . &quot;
i remember so many big , highly , highly , highly pushed eyes that were going on to me in this ritual .
some of us call ourselves a more , more kind of a term .
in this case , we have tested this .
for you , here &apos;s what &apos;s going on , &quot; then a miracle happened !
and there was no way to get a lot of time .
religious health .
it &apos;s harder to move the dead to an answer .
my friend simon godin , a master &apos;s name , does a master &apos;s book , wrote the big bang and so on .
and now they open your eyes .
you can open it up completely , and it &apos;s a lot of a lot of time .
but it &apos;s been exciting to me that these guys , at least most , know what they do for a living .
all of that was impossible for impossible .
you can create a lot of change . you can build roads .
and that &apos;s something that people want to think of .
you don &apos;t need everyone .
hugo baehr has not invented the most popular and middle class in venezuela , and he just led her .
and so it goes on .
they connect people together .
the reason ? now , this is a 60 year of old medicine using a 60 years old .
but there &apos;s another catch there .
it makes it more quickly , and it &apos;s about 26 times cheaper and more than 400 times more than our current energy system for pancreatic cancer .
but my experience with the islamic world are very different .
for example , there &apos;s the figure of the way we &apos;re crawling .
and why does sex lead to babies and why babies mean an erotic disaster ?
because it &apos;s the secret of the desire .
especially in the description of the other or myself -- that &apos;s the same thing -- particularly interesting , that there &apos;s no way there is no way of having a dent in desire .
this is your favorite and awkwardness that is biology , the natural instinct .
then , the desire to start . this study takes curiosity , and this is what curiosity takes .
you know that there &apos;s an erotic space that &apos;s heard every alone .
other places in the country had similar spaces .
in a nazi cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
ok .
it &apos;s mostly played in smaller rooms .
so early , some of the early things have been brought up .
so i asked myself , ok , is this a model for design , these adaptation that we practice ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned to me and said , &quot; there &apos;s me on me !
how do we solve the next three problems that i want to make for the language ?
albert einstein -- i &apos;m talking to someone when i was talking to a little bit of a while , and i met mr. einstein .
what &apos;s in life ? why am i here ?
i never read a talk or a lecture or a lecture .
and it was about 300 people there .
he talked about his personal experience .
a french historian said two centuries later , &quot; rarely has a so powerful to the authority of jesus christ . &quot;
or he was what he argued .
i &apos;m not going to mourn the arabs nor the most exciting .
but for that you have to sit around 10 minutes and take a woman in the arm that &apos;s not there .
i never was in .
harvest the chip .
i said , with tears in the eyes , i said , &quot; no . &quot;
in 2010 , a young woman stands before president loren and says , how they live and their siblings together died their parents in the war .
we go in rural areas and everything we do in this room is what &apos;s happening in this room , we create a space .
i failed .
i want to look back at a couple of years and see that there &apos;s a little bit of a girl , a nigerian girl , a nigerian girl , a little , nigerian girl on this ted stage .
lg : well , you &apos;d like to do .
licklider &apos;s recognized , computers can do the necessary power of power to make insight and decisions .
every interaction is recorded by more sensors , and you &apos;ve recorded the phone , your phone card , your computer card , you &apos;re a lot of data and we get the opportunity to understand our own way to understand our own .
these records were human health records .
by being introduced by a damaged process , what was a task for 40 people about three months , was a simple task for three people in 40 hours . that &apos;s all wins .
we should stop seeing out .
and to dinner with my wife and the children , after home .
because people say , &quot; shit man , i don &apos;t want time to be in time .
she was a much larger dog than i thought .
these effects are affecting us all .
the boom of national health &apos;s problems are going to be our problems .
think about the street , the most important .
in the era , we have more common in katrina .
and they all have done that , and if they don &apos;t , they have to be .
help me make green for the new black . help me make sustainability sexy .
so i thought that would be a chance to use scratch to make a interactive map for my mother .
but i &apos;m skeptical of what this is like to do .
in this case , you take a laser tag , put it on a pile , and the pile of the way that you can tell the behavior of the different characters in a game , or a story , in this case , is the great fish .
if you learn to code , you can program code to learn .
when children like victor are creating projects like victor , they learn important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s just the beginning .
what i want to talk about today to give you a background is that cars are art .
i want to talk to you .
and i think that this thought that great cars is a soul , very useful , and they all know that . they recognize a car with soul , and you know how strong it is .
this is one of my favorite things that really describes our relationship to cars .
right ? and they decided that it would be cheaper , instead of a studio and six or seven apartments , crying in malibu .
there was a lot of dialogue .
i think we felt very close to each other that day , we broke in rough threads , and we were making the concept for the real creature of true design and creativity .
we didn &apos;t bring it to boston .
i just got a little lab .
now we have clinical trials in four of these diseases in four .
we don &apos;t have a team of plastic companies and the team of food that can be able to inhabit this drug on the market .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
what you need to consider is that we have to do it with a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , with a hundred billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t explained was why entropy was ever low .
unlike the low entropy of the early universe , although we don &apos;t know the answer to that , we have a good theory that can explain this , if this theory is true , and that the theory of the dark energy .
and therefore , even though the universe is going forever , and ordinary matter and radiation , it will get increased , always a certain amount of radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even empty space .
but we also give it big fluctuations .
it turns out .
it &apos;s a systematic fact of the universe that you &apos;re accepting and not question .
i had never used a computer .
it was a future i couldn &apos;t accept .
now i want to do something out there , like me , saying to the africans and the poor who are fighting with their dreams .
no matter what i did in my real world , only by my little device in the digital world , eight years ago , in the year 2000 , in the year 2000 .
i took this very literally , i took my bike bike , and i put it a little bit of a little bit on the test table , which is the test test .
the camera doesn &apos;t just understand my movements , but it &apos;s also capable of understanding what things i think is in my hand .
and why just just work ? we can just play with documents .
all the work you saw is about my learning in india .
this is juan carlos , king of spain .
this is going to be the third park in rio that year .
again , you don &apos;t have to dig deep under the earth to build a station like this .
so i &apos;ll give you a quick example .
almost every year we have this awful computer .
we &apos;re under the average of the average in terms of the city .
a city of the future is a city that nobody &apos;s not an authority from this great community , which is cities .
the best answer is to try to reconstruct a darwin &apos;s evolution of evolution , and aesthetic preferences .
so the trick of evolution is , you &apos;re beautiful to make it a kind of gravity , so that you &apos;re making it a sense of gravity , just to look at them .
and some are too big to use them for the battles .
our strong response to images , to the expression of emotions in the art of music , is going to be the beauty of music in front of us and our offspring , as long as the human race exists .
well , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see here how the computer sees the environment , and you can &apos;t see the grim collar , we actually , we can actually see the driver , and actually see what &apos;s going on .
if mark is you can avoid it .
or blind people , in everyday devices , in education and in the office .
a subtle noise had started , the most subtle , the normal people don &apos;t hear any voices and i heard them , but i was told that something was wrong with me .
my mental health was a catalyst for the design of the hate , hate and physical and sexual and sexual and sexual , and i was told by my psychiatrist , &quot; eleanor , with cancer would be better than schizophrenia . &quot;
to get a heterosexual question , if social change begins , he can &apos;t be trusted .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to go through right now .
so what i &apos;m proposing is that it &apos;s where we should look for life , rather than mars , although mars , of course , is a very much more powerful and interesting place .
and the ordinary astronomers were full of contempt about it .
because it &apos;s the way that it &apos;s going to live out of life out there , it has tremendous benefits compared to life on a planet .
there was another thing that &apos;s going on to the very high , and this is the very high piece of furniture with creatures and the naked -- pretty scary things for a small child .
the first projects were modest , but they took technology and they could be able to do technology , and maybe find a new functionality in the way that they might be using a new functionality .
the other thing that the most important thing is to be fascinated is that we decided that we would have all the technical pieces of technology , this whole kind of thing , and tried to make it so beautiful .
so we called it y water . so this is another example where everything is happening in a room , the three-dimensional design , the ideas that are going to make the development of the brand , it &apos;s all intertwined .
this is my favorite anthony anthony , in switzerland , he had the laptop for a afternoon , i had to take him back with me . that was hard .
yves behar : the design of objects that tell stories
thank you .
my aunt , an incredibly , incredibly competent and brilliant woman , became early a widow .
she was the most popular of women who i &apos;ve ever heard of .
look at these young girls who go back to school after acid in their faces , &quot; the &quot; rescue &quot; was going to be . &quot;
the world was given the layma , was a world in the war .
then the situation will be tense .
they have to negotiate .
it &apos;s the people from my generation that are growing in a world where everything is in the world , and in some of our best conversations on a screen .
and ultimately it could mean that they could print their own medicine .
and if it &apos;s hopeful , why that &apos;s all interesting , then you have to look at the rest of saudi arabia , because it &apos;s a country that &apos;s the most difficult between the males .
maybe some things are bad traditions and they need changes .
let me give you an example : turkey , where i come from , which is a very , very fierce republic , we had a little bit of a little bit that &apos;s going to protect the universities , against the college students .
if i &apos;d be the only person that thinks that &apos;s what we would have a problem .
in the 19th century , as muslims saw europe , they were independent , they were independent .
so the eu was going to join the union process of turkey , the eu in turkey , in turkey of the nazis who were displaced by some of the nazis , as some of the people who were against them .
there &apos;s a very large nose that &apos;s not going to seem to be related to anything .
if scientists today , a century later , they want to make neurons visible , then they &apos;re lighting up the inside , rather than clean .
carl ornish : glimpses of our brain in our brain
but this trend is less clearly .
but for many parts of africa , it &apos;s a colleague of mine so that i was so upset , &quot; the truce was just voted on the right time , so the genocide could start the prison . &quot;
and instead of putting this possibility , local and international leaders soon inherited and have a lot of time to get out of the second psychotherapy , the events of the computer of the world , september 2001 and the wars in iraq .
and design design requires a strong focus on the most powerful , and the most powerful thinking and prestige and prestige .
the stromatolites are the heroes of my story .
in flat seas , life has been kept in the early ocean , and it turned into more complex shapes .
and they moved across continents . the big long trip began .
some of the mammals went back to the water .
every man should have the chance of being more brutal .
but there was nothing for this purpose , so we got married with prostate cancer and then we created our motto , which is , &quot; the face of man &apos;s man &apos;s face . &quot;
mo bhogle from canada , from the united states , and from england , and we call ourselves and said , &quot; hey , there &apos;s nothing here for prostate cancer .
and i said , &quot; last year , we had the lucky to have a lot of credit credit . &quot;
this kind of conversation , men to participate in every age , is so critical , and i think so much more important than the money we collect .
he could see what happened his forest , his environment , because his grandfather took him under his wing when he was just two years old and started teaching him about the forest and the way of living on his people .
when i thought about wonder , i wonder what our grandchildren and our our classmates would be if they ask the same question .
we need new models to be a leader and human history .
she works with people like the captain krishna .
a life for a life , through everything that came out of cultural revolution and everything after that , would have collected , so that he has over eight million parts in his museum , the contemporary chinese story .
it just happens .
&quot; my world &quot; is subjective .
or maybe he was just a thrill that was sitting on a rock and down the sky , and the sun and the moon .
and if you lived an extraordinary life , you will get into the air system , or how the french call it : the sky -- the sky -- the sky of the world &apos;s office .
and so it &apos;s coming to this great rituals where big amounts of water , and it &apos;s been being rejected for 10 days -- and it &apos;s been rejected for 10 days .
do you see what &apos;s a business of the behavior of the market and the behavior of an organization ?
see , this is india today . the most important reality of reality is based on a block of view .
you know , he &apos;s built the biggest largest computer , called &quot; big high shark . &quot;
&quot; why i chose this way , why not interest the mass ratio , i just get me , please . &quot;
sendhil mandelbrot opens up the eyes for a new look at the myths of india and the west -- and shows why these kinds of systems of the world &apos;s system , the death of death , with death and the most cosmopolitan we help us to be consistent .
but you know what ? it &apos;s almost 2012 to say , &quot; i &apos;m totally and completely competent , &quot; is , yourself , with the weakest praise .
you &apos;re interested in what ?
their friends and family will gather on the cemetery , and there &apos;s a tombstone on their grave , and on their grave , they &apos;re a tombstone , on the top of the &quot; here lies a great engineer . &quot;
they &apos;re happy . this is the conversation , and the mothers and fathers want to hear , because their child is good in math and they know what comes next .
this is because they -- you know what they &apos;re .
i have no patents and i never have money from a medical school system , and i don &apos;t have that that they choose me .
so how do you know if your breast is high density ?
ultrasound has more barbs to follow the relationship in the relationship with other technologies , and it &apos;s not very common .
if you find a tumor , as long as it &apos;s less than a centimeter , it &apos;s about 90 percent , but it falls massive with increasing growth .
the image of mbi shows this tumor much more likely , just like a second tumor that &apos;s very much in the surgical possibilities of the patient .
it costs a radiologists in particular to become an expert in it , a normal , normal detail of a human being .
some women who are getting sick of breast cancer die , and fortunately most of us survive .
1953 da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da
we gather these physicists in los angeles to see what they build .
mill .
they &apos;ve slept in this meeting .
this is an amazing vision .
it &apos;s a question of the consequences .
so let &apos;s go to the point .
what did i do ? i heard my belly ?
this is interesting . this is a different way to think .
the freaked out is basically a visualization of a human nature , where everyone &apos;s a body system that &apos;s going to be in the brain .
this is white noise .
and db is probably going to roll into your direction .
i did that only to make money .
thank you .
and he told me to a long silence : &quot; i wonder , &quot; i wonder , &quot; i &apos;m not going to find the people here fascinating than my apartment . &quot;
this is the reason i &apos;m with david edward , a scientist created an object that can absorb the toxic elements with these plants .
no , not potatoes , but tomatoes , herbs and so on .
the tragedies of other people can take easier than the own and i want to be just going to get the mind to the mind .
so loud malcolm gladwell was &#91; the &#93; most popular version of cocaine that was the most powerful version of tomato soup for the inner city .
he was a really interesting sight .
he went back to the second floor , and he said , &quot; hey boys .
like with mcdonald &apos;s .
let &apos;s think of other people &apos;s differences where you can expect a very high risk .
the second reason was that the gang was brilliant in marketing and labor .
economists talk about business theory -- that every game for two people have a more mature job .
the news is skydiving with a board on the feet .
so , in so high ways , as you can do , if you take step forward , if you &apos;re really going to go to a very low and mentally , you &apos;re working on it .
ue : no . this is just smoke .
i &apos;ll stop with scientists .
so i had the hope that , by looking at some natural elements , a little bit of fog , i could make the room tangible .
the dragline means that it makes a difference , whether you do something or not .
the big mountains in the distance are less .
how do we create an idea that is both tolerant to the absence of individuality , and also to optimize without the two in two different directions ?
i talked about new ways of the world &apos;s life , which is the animals to dominate , rather than coercion .
but even more incredible , the material was what the most important thing was .
you take them from the dead to take them .
at that time , he taught the classic at the university of college in mysore .
natalie merchant : singing old poems about life
it &apos;s hardly a dolphin .
as a adult , when i &apos;m about the amazing insights of penny , and koko , sue savage-rumbaugh with kanzi and panbanisha , the parrot , i heard , i heard , who were excited , i was excited .
so , t &apos;s name : ng : how that &apos;s there .
we &apos;re in the national aquarium , we &apos;re engaged for extraordinary learning , for the research and protecting .
but we found pretty quickly that we had a system that connects people together .
today . this is the first time you talk about this topic .
this is a picture of me and my daughter on the we hold an israeli flag .
&quot; because it works , make a poster with me . &quot;
they came and they were so many . one day , i remember that , i remember that , you know , that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen to me , and he said , &quot; who will see this ? &quot; and he said , &quot; everybody . &quot;
it &apos;s not the most appropriate . it &apos;s not my side .
and sometimes war is a war of war , but sometimes , with a little bit of effort , we can avoid it .
and what we want to do with &quot; yes is more &quot; to try to question that the architectural design system is almost still negative , and so against who or what we are .
and we saw this guy , a fellow .
and slowly , you start thinking that sustainable life makes less fun than live .
so go on the expo first to the danish pavilion , and take a seat of a bicycle , and drive on the other side of the other .
it was interesting because they discussed the morning of nine to 11 about the most traditional , and how many billion they should invest in the economy .
this is a comic from switzerland . in switzerland , there &apos;s a national need in switzerland .
we often do little movies .
what i &apos;d like to talk about was the biggest problems in the world .
but it &apos;s of course a problem when you urge people to focus on problems .
so what i intend to focus on is to say that we had a very long time , a situation where we had a number of choices .
and then you ask , why economists ?
but it says that what we can do is very little , too high .
the most common thing about malaria is a few million infected per year .
what happens here is that we think about our priorities .

and that doesn &apos;t seem to me right .
this data is sent layer to the device , starting with the base of the product , and it puts the material layer on layer by the new layer of water in a pool of the old layer of the old layer of light .
it was made by the aquarium of about four layers of layers .
a repulsion will probably be less likely .
you can just make it directly right on the ground .
this is what the product is made .
without any doubt , i believe that this technology is creating a revolution in production and the most important way we &apos;re going to change them .
he was worried that when he called her at this name , especially outside , you could think , he would be a business of jihad .
they use their attention .
the good news is that it doesn &apos;t have to be that way .

it &apos;s actually said that more energy needs to make a solar cell than you &apos;re going to bring into your entire body system .
solar cells are collecting a light for four hours .
and they &apos;re also more dangerous than they are , and so they &apos;re dangerous .
this is a very crude one .
it &apos;s just a little cylinder down here , which has the generator and all the most uplifting in itself , and this is the hot whale , the hot cylinder , the hot cylinder , the hot cylinder , which is cold , and it comes out of electricity .
you don &apos;t have to use the hot water , it can also break down .
so here we have a map of the united states .
and we don &apos;t have a a dime that &apos;s so fast to use this energy as we do right now .
we &apos;re putting it on and look at the parts .
it &apos;s a flying lab that we did in the field of this molecule .
but i still have written bad poems , and he never got the most complete in the air , but he went to cuba .

td : since i had a recent childhood and after , many different pressures were given , and when i was young , it was always that my journey was already more enjoyable .
this is beautiful , but we should remember that a similar process also should be happening on environmental level .
td : lakshmi worked incredibly hard , even for my invitation , let me get to the rest of what they did , so that it &apos;s happening , and i was sometimes quite resistant , and i was very nervous , and i was very nervous during this whole week .
in these two examples , we &apos;ve seen machines who have learned to go to the simulation , and others who have learned it in reality .
if i say , &quot; i &apos;m going to make my advice for the future .
but nobody believes it &apos;s actually going to be very effective if there &apos;s a real outbreak .
the biggest part of the war in bush &apos;s administration is actually rather related to anthrax and the threat through biological .
we know that the virus will be scattered . it will be another virus .

some of the poorest countries who have most experience with h5n1 have a lot of drugs that have already gone .
and i think even our leaders would say that we have a lot to do with a lot of time .
i &apos;m pleased to answer their questions .
our centers for the world centers have developed one of them , and as rapid as a fast , it &apos;s an early way of doing .
and in the same time , in the same time , similar bacterial infections were not a problem .
don &apos;t just pay attention to how much fun you have , but also how the wages are completely changing the way that you have to interact with a city like san francisco .
please put me a little bit of a card .
i &apos;m going to do a boy with a boy a boy , and he &apos;s got a little bit of me to sell three clubs .
since my childhood was playing with a fire , i was playing with fire , and i &apos;m going to go , and i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m going to be a 10-year-old .

because of the most dark leaves and branches , it &apos;s very dark and very quiet .
i &apos;m interested in the secret of the world &apos;s dynamics , and i think of the dynamics of the quantum field that live in the forest .

so i started about 15 years ago .
the air is going to the air , and the air comes out of the air , and it comes out of the air .
each of these computers can do the entire system , so if two of them are getting there , there &apos;s any distribution of phosphorus .
but this is what it looks like , and this habitat is always going on , over many miles .
so sharks are not quite so dangerous , as most people are talking about .
when we found it , we weren &apos;t even sure about what family he heard , so we called him a little bit of the time , and he looked like he looked like he was coming from his books .
oxygen oxygen caused a two-hour and he was fired .
this means that every one of you here at least is a child who is at least a child &apos;s disease suffering .
and its communication and social interaction improved , that he could visit a normal school and even become a more common school .
it &apos;s like life : if you &apos;re only in there , you can &apos;t get out of it .
i know you &apos;ve never heard of him . but you &apos;ll notice this day , one day you &apos;ll hear about him , because he &apos;s a fascinating man . &quot;
nk : no , he died 25 years ago .
he had a lot of love , he loved everybody .
we all , all of us , are what happens when a soup of hydrogen and helium is so long , that they &apos;re starting to ask themselves to ask their origins .
these are the most important evidence that life can exist in many other environments .
so you have to learn the diversity and the incredible scale of life in the world in the first step , to make a match on a contact with life elsewhere .
so , silicon is so important , and we will be expanding in the future , and we &apos;re going to expand it in 350 antennae so that it &apos;s sensitive to the moore &apos;s law , and the moore &apos;s law of evolution .
and then we &apos;d like to make the most playful search through human health &apos;s .
many people say it &apos;s the best place in the world to study climate change .
everybody cylinder is a time of time .
while you &apos;re going to the ice , you &apos;re blowing a couple of gloves in a oven , so you can put a new pair of gloves in a oven , so you can put a new pair of applause on your hand and get rid of your fingers .
i think that &apos;s a little bit of a economic effort in this place .
and our soldiers are not very happy to be happy to do with pipelines in the blink of the head of the way they actually introduced themselves to the service to go to the u.s. government .
you can keep that further , and the efficiency of almost talented improvements and the price of impact is double the size of the big ocean failure .
we could build bigger cars , which would be the security of the security , but it should be easy .
but instead , they sell it to china and japan because we have to have the protection of our own business and the other ones don &apos;t .
and by the time of the most remote mass mass of this kind of mass mass energy , or in this case , to make a design of the design of the world , as good as the most good , the most important thing is to do , the most important thing that the internet is able to do is to do the same as the internet has gone to the internet .
it can &apos;t just act about a giant conspiracy .
there were two types of negative feedback that we have .
we hope that it &apos;s really stable .
oops , i was wrong .
at the end , he found a computer writer , a dutch scholar called han van meegeren , who sold him a wonderful vermeer to a prize who had about 10 million dollars today .
and according to his favorite , he looked like he &apos;d have discovered that there was bad in the world . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s coming . what is it ? &quot; is a good answer .
but how attractive you find them , how much they &apos;re getting sexually , or romantic , depends on what they think they &apos;re looking at .
but each of these three objects has worth a value beyond what it takes to be because of his story .
but i don &apos;t want to copy a copy , even though i can &apos;t see the difference .
so he brought joshua bell to take his home to a subway station in washington d.c. , to put himself on a corner and see how much money he will take .
the second shock is less painful because you &apos;re going to get a little bit of it .
and if you &apos;re going to be able to see that maybe there &apos;s a kind of political engineering system .
they &apos;re doing it that they &apos;re a organic , professional member of the american bank of the u.s. capital of the city of the city of the city of the city .
and what you find is , of course , people who eat vegetables and oil , fewer , more sophisticated .
the most amazing thing is one of the most intriguing things in the world of medicine .
it &apos;s a very high conclusion when you give a drug in such high dose that it will have more side effects , and that you &apos;re going to be better and better and better .
the big trials are closer to the answer .
this is a problem that doesn &apos;t have any solution to this .
and very soon , they would have begun to get this coal , ton to spend a ton of money , and the way to go back to china , back to china and everywhere in the world .
can you imagine how you feel if you were to be on my point ?
it &apos;s just about oil ; you know that all you know .
there &apos;s this thing that the world &apos;s most important , and the one comes from the middle of the united states .
and what do you see ? they &apos;re christians .
the americans , they are kind of like , &quot; ah , beep .
these christians are a lot of the time .
they &apos;re wiping out . that &apos;s wrong .
and the soldiers are chinese , and all the other are chinese .
you can imagine that maybe one of them at the morning , to their child , and it &apos;s offered to be a little bit and said , &quot; honey , i &apos;m back back .
everything has changed .
and all of this has had tremendous impact on the world .
i think thomas jefferson was actually stuck with words .
for the most important time in the audience , the way to explain why is a larger budget than a comedy park , and that &apos;s because of the fact that it &apos;s easier to translate in other languages and cultures . so the market is bigger for these films .
but it &apos;s going to happen within this century .
this is not the u.s. capital of the united states , which is going to be on a million , but the gdp of the world per capita -- 200,000 dollars .
and also , as everyone here knows -- it &apos;s about energy , not oil .
my choice is the peak of a life commitment , which started growing up on the gulf of the gulf of the gulf .
a lot of our actions on this planet that are going on on our living environment are just by faith and guess .
one is every thousands of years of it for thousands or millions .
we have to calm down before we ruin the planet .
e. wilson : saving life on earth
another one is the famous european aurochs .
the genome of the passenger pigeon contains 1.3 billion base base base .
the reversal of extinction falls into these category .
real falcon made of light just chicken chickens .
there &apos;s a program behind the street , which is just brilliant .
this is an emotional issue . some people stand up .
my grandmother was a mom .
i also made my own comic , which was another way to tell stories , through words and through images .
and we sat there briefly , in silence and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really talented . &quot;
use your own style . draw not , you &apos;re telling you .
&quot; rather jarrett , i have your favorite .
i &apos;m going to publish a children &apos;s book , and i &apos;m going to put the title , &quot; the police police who &apos;s who &apos;s who &apos;s who &apos;s who &apos;s who &apos;s who &apos;s doing . &quot;
sound affects us constantly , psychological , cognitively and more competent .
this is a 32 million pounds of expensive , important , highly , built in england recently , designed by a british scientist .
but it &apos;s not just kids who are affected by that .
people who say , don &apos;t let the team sit next to this team because the noise might need and the other quiet .
&quot; upwake &quot; a story about zero , a contemporary business business , who carries his life in the suitcase with himself , and the between the dream and reality is not able to connect both to non-zero-sum explosions .
and the frames and four years later , and a job later , what was going on was a little bit of a sudden a computer designer , a more significant one of the assignments of a politician .
i know theater connects us .

if you look around in the bathroom , you see some products more like this , like , for example , the more important , more expensive , more cosmopolitan , but also the crabs .

they &apos;re working on the ninth prize , so they started in the 1930s , and now the letters is reaching .
hundreds of verbs can behave like this .
you can see that as the language of the thoughts , or &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; test . &quot;
so the mystery is , why would , polite requests , and then , in addition , and threats so often , are they going to be covered ?
you can try to imagine what would be used if language could be literally used .
and the other puzzle is that i don &apos;t have a problem with it .
here &apos;s my argument . is it sustainable ? is it good ?
it makes it a lot of time . it &apos;s a lot of time .
what are you doing from that , to convince me ?
all these different roles . can you imagine a argument where they &apos;re working , but in the audience , and watch themselves in the conversation ?
or -- and that &apos;s the most important part of me : we want them to be in the world of nature , and we &apos;re bringing a design design and finding the master of the nature that could inspire us .
it changed everything . from there , these engineers weren &apos;t allowed to bring them into the boat .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here &apos;s how we make things .
this is the national national lab .
this would be a fuel fuel for fuel cells if you could without any overlap .
this is not easy because life is only a subset of elements in the periodic table .
and feel , and they &apos;re really important to be feedback .
what you don &apos;t see is you can &apos;t count .
my first business was a computer company . i started under the taliban .
in south korea and indonesia are almost a half of the companies in south korea .
because , as the most prolific , the smaller people in direct context are emerging to increased economic growth .
and in all the world , no exceptions are exceptions .
people are going to be a miracle of delight and this miracle .
i have a big job of serendipity , and i &apos;m happy to put cows on my own book , and now use paper paper to use it to be a paper towel .
first we have it .
what does that mean ?
when i started to deal with them , i realized that they &apos;ve adapted incredibly well .
but the researchers had a problem .
until you finally , you went to the conclusion , and the campus left -- and certainly you were getting away , and you get a few times back to the course of the crows , and then the crows have always remembered them .
we found that they &apos;re really smart and they can teach each other .
squirrel for example would come to come to see , look at the peanut and go back .
but there were three problems , three puzzles i couldn &apos;t solve , and i want to talk about it , but even more importantly , i found a computer card .
who would ever hire me ? &quot;
and imagine what could happen because every region has a difference .
let me make the connection .
you know that there &apos;s the future of the future . you have to understand that .
that &apos;s a lot of crap .
oh yeah , i &apos;m going to be the johnny &apos;s song .
about 10 million of them .
and here we see , with the words of the radiologists israel , &quot; like the hand in a way , &quot; the penis in a way that reminds you . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yes , but i would rather be eating , if you don &apos;t have anything about it . &quot;
i said to the one that i said , &quot; you should make an experiment .
he had a line in his book , who was supposed to be supposed to be out of the village , and there was an atheist maria , who had trouble with conception .
so now you have an evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i &apos;ve got to read you what they said , because i think it &apos;s so beautiful .
i think that &apos;s very unfortunate . i don &apos;t want to use it because i want to use it .
and that &apos;s actually the beginning of our story .
now i thought to this moment that at age 50 , one of the skills i really realized was to tie my shoes .
first of all , i have to tell you that i &apos;m not here .
yes . the artist doesn &apos;t seem to know exactly where to get the different colors .
but i can see in your faces that you &apos;re still a little skeptical .
it &apos;s called &quot; the &quot; water &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
after a while , i decided to have a little fun , and before i left the room in the morning , i would cheat a few things in the room .
and now they &apos;re all in there .
my father was one , so my youth was really interesting .
the song as just a fact .
i , &quot; wait , is yes , i &apos;m going to be good -- i &apos;m going to put wheels . &quot; &quot; from the early protest , &quot; i was the strangely wheels , and i built them and -- could i look at my favorite , please ?
it sounds just , but i think we generally believe in our society and culture with intent .
he was designed the goose himself , and he was really proud of it .
human , i love the thing .
the consequences of a planet , on the already , seven billion people live .
it was very proud of the very sheer seat , which he had had the real seat he had given his father &apos;s seat , and around the beautiful , the seat around the seat .
intent -- a life with intent -- well , the original thing that &apos;s done is something better .
i saw the whole mass of a left , and i was stuck that she was lost , and i was stuck with all of the things i didn &apos;t have done yet , but it was not possible .
and then i started to ask how many times before my life would have been , if this man would have been injured , if this man had me , if my genes have a different portion of experience .
i was , but i was now a ted , and i was myself , and i think , i guess , i was going to myself .
i had made a lot of simpler , and this turkish computer , and i had to share with a number of words , and to make me back on my way .
he spent six months in prison , lost his home for a decade .
yes , contrast .
we &apos;re working with the machine , and we &apos;re working on the university of california , san diego .
first , the perception of people . and second , a natural interface , a natural interface of control , so that the interaction is going to be more intuitive with the robot .
and yet , i made this idea to own .
after i realized these economic risks , i thought we need to find a solution for this problem .
some of the speakers actually woke up the speakers , like nathan chaplin &apos;s kind of talk , or the one of tim ferriss , who may be considered a high .
i don &apos;t know a tedtalk that includes that .
so this time i paid 25 cents , because i found the task is a little harder .
and yet , there was one , which was all safe : the expansion had to slow down .
keep the mystery of the dark energy in the back of the back , because i &apos;m going to call them three main string theory .
the list of the group goes up about 10 to 10 .
and he was working on this number of things to explain , but he didn &apos;t succeed , and we know why .
each of these universes has additional dimensions .
because the astronomers today by turning powerful telescopes to heaven , discover a handful of photons -- a kind of cosmic cable , billions of years on the road .
well , i want to be honest with you and tell you that most of it is a trick , but a trick that actually works .
think about it , it &apos;s the first time you meet him . but we really want to make it more interesting .
he said , &quot; go , milo . squash them . &quot;
pm : this is dimitri &apos;s right in the blink of it .
we don &apos;t know anybody here .
the next moment , the phone doesn &apos;t work anymore , the tv is , the military men are on the street , there are a lot of the police soldiers .
it was a very grim meeting of the reporters who had been working in the war , who of ngos , of course , the bold , brave people of sarajevo himself .
if i &apos;m going to go , why i &apos;m going to keep doing it , why i keep going , that &apos;s the reason .
but it &apos;s my job of this testimony to break and that &apos;s the most expensive thing to do , the core of the thing for us .
even before a goal appears to be with the joystick , the joystick of the rockefeller nerve is trying to find the goal , no matter where it is .
basically we trained the animals to control these kinds of things , and explore objects in the virtual world .
in a experiment that we did a few years ago , we went to the limit .
so we start in china .
so min was doing the most popular thing .
please raise your hand .
the last reason has to do with that is that women are part of the solution .
in niger , one of seven women dies in the average of a child &apos;s birth .
it was part of the solution , not the problem .
larry pugh , when he was yelling as a bank of the world bank , once said , &quot; it can be good that investment in the developing world is going to be the highest , the highest growth . &quot;
this is bill , &quot; it &apos;s bill . &quot;
and that was the feather of a bird .
this whole shoreline around one of our own favorite shows tells us that there &apos;s a more mature one .
and even this picture makes sense of suspects , to be a little bit of the way -- how something from the most violent &amp; amp ; motts &apos;s crane .
one of these ways was that we could have gotten into small areas of it .
they put their arrowheads down and say , &quot; i want to share this arrowheads against the end of the end . we share 50 to 50 . &quot;
there are places on this island where they can make all three or four miles to a new language .
when 27 individuals from these 27 member member of these 27 member member gave up to a table , they &apos;ll tell you a simple one that they need an army of the very important , to be prepared by the most important possibilities .
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that they also have language .
and what i &apos;m interested in most of the is the invisible space between a text and the most the other image , and how the picture is changing through the text , and the text is the image .
this is a lot of the world &apos;s most important , which is running across the ocean of the atlantic ocean and north america .
they turn the negative to .
but through the impression of the testing , the way of cleaning up , the most common and live , the most common thing .
larry pugh was eight years of a 10 year-old girl sentence in arizona , in arizona , for kidnapping and repeated a young boy on a mountain table .
before you are , people are leaving themselves .
and they &apos;ve taken them for us here for texas .
and now , you &apos;re driving with the food where you &apos;re in this moment .
it &apos;s just the vast space that makes it look like this , as a result .
this is what &apos;s called addicted to a sense of happiness , and the pursuit of happiness .
in part , the legacy of the bat , the embodiment of happiness , the pursuit of happiness , is driven by the kind of data of the individual , and could not be found in reality .
a very popular one in science of happiness is that happiness and bad people are not a fair continuum of a closed continuum .
it starts in the field of water .
here &apos;s a three weeks old .
in the animal kingdom , there &apos;s only one way to increase the status of this .
i want to end with some quotes .
why should you choose rats ?
once the rat understood that , we have a little bit more complicated .
you can actually cure t.b. , even people who are hiv-positive .
with the knowledge that a patient who stays down , down to 15 people -- 15 healthy people -- a year , can be safe to be saved by a lot of life .
here we are neurons .
so this is important for imitation and emulation .
now , the question is : if i just watch a different person being touched , why am i not confused and did literally watch this kind of thing from the naked , how someone is being touched ?
thank you . i have two missions here today .
i &apos;m not about the most important , but it &apos;s not about the pollen itself .
all these pictures were recorded by a brain scan by the way by kew &apos;s lab .
even every single one of us has a story to tell us the most important story .
we need to be so good as the breast cancer campaign to address this crisis .
right now , in the 1980s , when we &apos;ve gone up and death , as we &apos;ve been growing up with heart disease , she wrote a cover for the new england journal of medicine and called the syndrome .
our colleagues in washington , d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike the other , x-ray , x-ray , for women who are sending their breast vision to the heart , every time we add something to the heart , we say , &quot; is this test really necessary ? &quot;
okay , here we have started .
they did what they said , they &apos;ve given them , and they were gathered together .
the cells have something like this , and the shell is feeling like they &apos;re not in the bookstore .
what does that mean for us ?
in the course of three years , we took eight to 10 hours , and we collected about a quarter of a million hours of carbon , and they were running up .
this is one of the first most important things that came out of a year ago , which really surprised us .
and finally , my son is going to be alone in a walker .
three of the most important people in this project philip , rony , and induced roy roy , are here to see .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamic in the game .
this is the first time that our son made more than two steps -- captured in the movie .
and that &apos;s a very important question to be more important , because the better we understand how the brain makes meaning , the better we can communicate . i think the better we can think and work .
it &apos;s a kind of center where you see a picture and you think &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional response to that . &quot;
what we literally do is to paint our teams on a large wall on a large wall .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just about hygiene , but it &apos;s also about the possibility of relaxation .
so it doesn &apos;t make it .
if you translated that into the building industry , if you have a solar system and you &apos;re a window , we &apos;re saying , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken , that &apos;s being fixed .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we continued to put on .
are we just stupid ?
you can see it through two years , if you read eight hours a day .
and so you can go to september in september , and say , &quot; i &apos;m important today .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
and the police waiting to walk the fire of the fire to cut the vehicle into pieces of the driver &apos;s body .
and that &apos;s enough to go into the present with the most important in the united states , which is a eye of divinity .
all of that leads to -- the only thing that we &apos;re doing is to name that , which is what we &apos;re most doing at the most , digital devices .
this is the consequence of the destruction of more than a third of the brain on the right through the stroke .
this is a very , very low level of being dumped from the healthcare system .
he was holding my jaw in the right position while he was holding my teeth .
alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator who is fascinated by the , to close the gaps , whether he &apos;s a deaf , or a blind , or a blind , or a paralyzed movement .
now i had to go into the dark years , and i was trying to figure out what was going on in particular , when everything was going on today , was gone .
and it works . it works .
lp : so if you have the opportunity , you spend a time with simon .
and these were the developing countries : they had big families and a relatively short life .
and these are on this side . a big , very faint of africa and the world &apos;s the ones .
and then deng xiaoping came and brought money to china and brought the country back to a middle .
a search of a search that we can copy the data in a form of a format and to publish the world , and what do we hear when we look around ?
but this creates hypotheses .
you know , darwin has explained life after it came out , but what was the essence of life ?
and i learned about it , and i learned francis crick .
but there was what in the literature .
we were not the best chemist in the room .
i was unhappy ; my girl didn &apos;t get married .
you can compare dna to the normal sectors and the other of them .
and so i &apos;ll conclude by saying , i &apos;ve seen that we &apos;ve looked at 20 people with schizophrenia .
average , the defense is in a case of two million dollars , and it takes 18 months to win .
first , they don &apos;t fight the patent , but it &apos;s not the patent .
my solution : give me this patent and i &apos;ll let you disappear .
&quot; why not ? &quot; the girls said .
the fathers were in a place where they &apos;re moving their daughters to play their chairs , and they could reach their hand to dance .
this is a great technology .
it &apos;s not much left on the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in humans .
can &apos;t see the enemy most of the time , and we needed another process to eradicate polio as we had to get to smallpox .
it helped control pandemic growth , for example , sars .
the reality of polio today is something different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : well bruce , where are you the most difficult places ?
bruce ghosh : how we &apos;re going to bring polio to a standstill
dj : we found this high-resolution now at all possible animals , especially at the cats .
and to our surprise , it became a very high one .
for us , this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration , a symbol of this hope , which is accompanied by our work .
it was incredibly amazing than it took it in safety to protect it before the hyena .
and of course , if i look at these online numbers , the most powerful , it reminds me of a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic , because it &apos;s a bit of your fate in our hand .
we need it . we respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman , as a community and we need to continue to continue .
but it seems obvious to be obvious that the earth is big and remain free , the sun small and flexible , but it &apos;s worth what &apos;s going on to be able to be able to fit out of it .
and that &apos;s because in middle middle of the middle world there is always .
nature &apos;s nature depends on what kind of animal we are .
because there are so many of them , because between them , there &apos;s no consensus about their favorite , the most cosmopolitan , the most prolific , as we see it in middle middle world , and we &apos;re stuck with it .
people like to treat scientifically as a machines , and it &apos;s unacceptable , but it &apos;s a waste of time that you want to guess what the person &apos;s fame will do next .
i was going to be at the wheels age of 40 years old in the wheels of 40 .
over a cursor i control with my head , i allow these miniature machines to see me , and send them to the robot , and send them the buttons in a plastic store .
with people like you , we can make this dream .
for example , in oceanography , for example , a health lexicon of the u.s. community is developed by basically the most cosmopolitan , which is actually sending the dolphins to send them .
i think we can form a global community .
this is a hot penguin training system .
there are now some of the lessons that you can learn from it .
but normally we don &apos;t do this .
i think we tend to look at this : the infrastructure of globalization .
this is down to 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem we need to solve .
i also assume most of you don &apos;t talk chinese -- what &apos;s really sad if you think that this is the most common language in the internet .
what do you look at ? maybe we should do that .
if you look at this picture , you might think , &quot; why should i be interested in all this ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look back and find the world in it .
they would get wealth and security , religious violence and make sure that states never serve the terrorists .
and part of this activity is honesty .
what is this ?
i love this dish .
and the war was unstable , the 20 million people who live -- until today , the civil war is in the world .
suzanne sen , who is this guy , &quot; i would have made all of this money , but i &apos;ve spent all these time trying to look at the american man who had stolen my recipe .
chinese restaurants have done the same thing , i would argue , with the menu and the decoration -- even the restaurant name -- but without an centralized headquarters .
in contrast , we have general tso chicken , which was actually in new york city in the early 1970s , when i was just at the university of new york city in the early 1970s , so ...
so what we see in the 17th century , 18th century is the most common search of medicine , which creates the same .
so people would have a really big fit .
when the protocols started to become less , i was clearly depressed , until i thought , my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
do you remember having to go on every line ?
and 18 , i slept on the night .
and again , i &apos;ll get depressed and some obscure .
so many of us are clear that there &apos;s a lot of time to do in the next few years , with a better world .
he goes around : &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know . where did the world work in the treatment of the known problems that came together from the potential of earthquake and climate change ?
if you wrap the impossible to the impossible , you can do it .
but we &apos;ve reached a agreement to climate change .
and there &apos;s god crying .
the most remarkable thing makes you a little remarkable : it uses two ingredients , proteins and water that are in your spinneret , to create a material that is extraordinary to be extraordinary , with technical fibers like kevlar .
or you &apos;re doing beautiful things like this , if the camera can capture it .
here you see how it &apos;s taken from the tissue .
with my new project , marilyn cousteau , i want to use art to create technology .
there &apos;s a microphone that &apos;s going to put that on the date and the round of applause and the most flexible -- hopefully not -- to help him to make some of his next decisions .
what do i do ? &quot;
in the frame of this , unprecedented demonstration data , heather knight data , a very long one , can be more than a more complex , and he &apos;s putting the feedback of his audience and his behavior , and he &apos;s going to be the answers to the amount of money . works this thing ?
stanley milgram , inventor of the famous news of the world &apos;s ted company , thought , in the most cosmopolitan , and the most cosmopolitan , it had a connection between two to seven steps .
how does our view change about relationships in the way that we have to have a whole difference ?
but there was a exchange that i &apos;m going to tell you , and where maybe he could have been able to put me into the ear .
um ... my father , a computer card ?
it was his father who decided that she needed false papers .
this feeling of responsibility about other life , despite his young age of 17 years , and also his fault , to be a more , a , a , because he was out of a camp , he kept his entire life for his life .
and as my 15-year-old student , and my favorite story gave up , i gave up , i was a wrong thing , a little bit of papers .
i asked him , in the face of the victims he had had , if he ever had the ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever imagined .
we grow from a few million people to the seven billion people that we are today , right now .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a giant , a giant , a giant , a giant layer of light , which is a very good one for the next , seemingly , in a good state .
if you go to the forests of the forest , the border at the land of land , you &apos;re hurting the ability to stay stable .
with the realization of the learning , fishermen , the great barrier reef reef and scientists , that the great barrier reef is being damn damn under the current economy .
but the drama is of course that clearly , the fact that the change is not an option .
that leads me to another reason why i &apos;m here today : because i really like media all kind of .
this is a race of a race of a race of a race .
first , he uses an ancient kind of manufacturing , the most ancient and connected , and it &apos;s related to a three-dimensional perspective , which was a whole new technique at that time .
and by the process of sugar , i hired portraits of them .
it became very large pictures and i took them with a very large camera , a computer camera camera .
my interest in the world , especially worse , is really far more powerful .
on the back , one sequence is also a sequence that is also the chimps .
we can ask , is there universal differences between africans and the aid of the world ?
and then you can compare it to the genome of living people .
we can then ask the same questions as the same question , how to have the neanderthal people today , have these people mix up today ?
there are many people who designed their own vision , like this vision of the beginning of the 20th century .
after my belief , the plane of the future is its own consciousness .
imagine , carbon nanotubes grow in 3d 3d printer , and they &apos;re embedded in a long-term , and follow the forces that occur in their components .
they &apos;re not talking . but they were incredibly isolated from the world around them , from their environment and from the people .
they would be a police call . they would call the police .
now we know that it &apos;s about 100 .
you see a video .
you have the feeling that the research you have to be really , really , is to have a effect on reality , that you can actually prevent these experiences with that one that i had started to start on this area .
then you go .
you can see , you can see , in a rigid position -- chin , on the top of the car , poor extended over your body &apos;s car .
they did everything like that , and they were taught to do it .
and after the battle , they bring these mobile records and they do what they call &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; road &quot; to teach you what you did .
also , people have changed .
i said , &quot; where is he now ? &quot;
this is not a matter of light .
and she showed it on the left to say , how problematic this picture was , that it was for you with the idea of how black was represented .
it &apos;s really in this sense of the most important , that i have a new set of questions that i &apos;m going to do .
well , this is sort of an obvious statement .
and the kids said , &quot; how do we do that . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to multiply numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long did you have to do that before you decided you didn &apos;t understand anything ? &quot;
their main set of people , they &apos;re going to be on 50 , which is new schools to do with a nuclear scientist teacher .
and 75 percent . the test , two months later , was the result of 76 percent .
after eight ted talks , he wanted to be there .
these are 11,000 .
suddenly , i looked out of the darkness of the dark side of the space , a mirror of mirrors that were cut off the moon .
if i had to reduce the whole story on a picture , what would it be ?
now i &apos;m going to show you some clips from my other big project in this year . &quot; the tempest &quot; -- the storm &quot; -- the storm . &quot;
and our little life ends up in a sleep .
bono : they &apos;re mythologies .
i know you understand that .
so , blue , blue , everything was blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both of them play in africa .
it &apos;s another one that acts at the interface of health and business .
let &apos;s use the markets as the most expensive thing that we have , and we find out what the people would pay for for the people that would pay the choice .
thank you .
the most popular was that if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we destroyed two more juice and 10 tv .
the little little bit of it , to remove its tracks , and that was a problem .
this is very good . it &apos;s going to slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of a few of the models that i work with .
tissue of the density of breast density is the second part , and the second part is , and that &apos;s actually the key to use these models for the long-term system .
thank you .
now , trying to let them fly just like trying to shoot a arrow with the end end , and it was hard work , and young , young , i have a lot of respect to nature .
now let &apos;s look at the other side .
we &apos;re working on projects -- even more sophisticated developments , so much as a result of the world &apos;s -- darpa , the california institute of technology and university , los angeles .
be careful , behave just like wood or something like wood .
now i didn &apos;t try to be a professional .
they go forever .
these are about two billion .
it takes it to be about the three years of the &quot; three years of a computer . &quot;
don &apos;t forget that one age .
but for me , it &apos;s great because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time that we live in the human mind and machines .
i clearly have mass . where did she come from ?
it &apos;s too much to be more likely to fall in the wild in 20 to 30 years .
all the evidence at the point of the present is that this cancer is being broadcast from a virus .
i took the opportunity to be true and took some samples from jonas &apos; tumor and a few samples from other parts .
she brought it to a veterinarian and he discovered something called a little bit more mature .
and then , finally , cancer is an inevitable consequence of the ability to share our cells and adapt their environment .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and that &apos;s a global phenomenon .
they would be able to wait for them to wait .
and that &apos;s the third reason why a low expectation doesn &apos;t make us happy .
but they didn &apos;t feel that the numbers were on them .
first of all , i &apos;m going to show you the most important for the optimism bias .
but the good news is that our illusion is not broken when we &apos;re aware of this kind of thing .
but what we &apos;re going to see in the 21st century is asia , which goes back to the past half , and then to give more than half the world &apos;s population and to give half the global economy .
you could look at this as the privatization of the war .
after 1958 , the soviets had the soviets , was called &quot; this is the end of america . &quot;
if you &apos;re living in japan or new delhi or new delhi , your view is going to be something different than you live in beijing .
and if we have strategies in which we &apos;re going to get this in bigger historical context , we can be able to do this process .
how do we define our national interests so that it &apos;s not just a long-term diet , but it &apos;s positive .
that &apos;s the conventional approach .
this has typically got the responsibility to the more stable to guarantee a stable security crisis .
they &apos;re all dependent on the long .
jobs for who ? especially for young men .
after all the legal system is collapsed , you can &apos;t even get the property of the problem .
the recovery would be taken from the way to the conflict , government .
this is the silhouette of my hometown of new orleans .
the military has understood it . they call the climate change , the security and stability , as governments are discussing in the world , how to respond to the world .
it allows you to become more productive , so you can afford to do the insurance itself .
these are certainly inspiring examples of possible solutions , if we feel in the situation to plan to be able to plan for a world .
listen like chinese students to do english by shouting it .
teacher : perfect ! students : perfect !
and that includes things like the concrete world with a little bit of carbon dioxide that we &apos;re trying to make sense of consistent , and we also take the hypothetical seriously , which is , we &apos;re more likely to ask ourselves what might be like .
luria looked at people before they were in the scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to a civilizational world .
there was luria : &quot; on the north pole , there &apos;s always snow .
they chose two-six instead of new york .
it wasn &apos;t just the prevalence of cognitively sophisticated professions .
would you have made it to be killed ? &quot;
you could say a half seconds .
it feels like i landed in a colony of angels . &quot;
and they &apos;re going to me to make a degree in something .
it &apos;s still in the red numbers , but chris did it with personal victims , this film .
i &apos;m one of her favorite .
there &apos;s a prime minister , a minister of cheese , secretary of defense and a cab , or president of the war .
boy : the most serious thing is serious .
we were all angry on them : &quot; why do you do that ?
that &apos;s going to be a lot of real , if you read it . &quot;
we &apos;ve always played the game for weeks after weeks , about seven weeks , and we had all the 50 together , and we &apos;ve actually been selectively selectively selectively transmitted to the chaos .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
many people announced good jobs , and they were going to be able to get the most expensive ones .
it &apos;s like its own little connection .
if i all get three legs of the triangle , in the three peaks of the triangle , i would get a tetrahedron .
so everything you do is -- it &apos;s a very , very noisy case -- this old kind of old , and this old plastic , and this is a very simple plastic , and this is very simple in an old fashion .
this is possible when you have a whole piece of paper , tweet paper -- you can be in a high school , or in a state of school -- a leaf , a ruler , a ruler , no glue , no glue .
what we do is a very simple kind of heat .
this is a little straw , which is what you do , these two corners of this , it will be like a car mite .
here are two magnets .
it was very many passengers on the ship , and they were bored , so the captain invited them to his deck .
in the middle conference , arvind gupta shows a simple and more amazing plans to turn waste into really a very , good constructed toys , which can build children themselves -- while they &apos;re learning the basic principles of science and design .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually examples of biology that had many evidence .
and there &apos;s a few examples of projects that are aware of the natural sands .
and with a little plan , we can make a place of traffic is dominated in a place that offers open space for people who are in the open , and they &apos;re turning waste into opportunities with food and they &apos;re turning waste into opportunities .
this photo was done by the day of the day , and only a year later , it looked like this .
if you wipe out seawater , the first thing is calcium carbonate .
no , you have to be able to mimic people with visions of visions with visions . &quot;
i was looking for somebody who is jewish because i &apos;m jewish , because i &apos;m very important .
but the real failure was that there were many men who wanted to come out with me .
very few of us have the ability to be absolutely honest with themselves .
he flies as long as it &apos;s not on a top of a car .
i was basically trying to be in the way that i was .
because remember my favorite , you have to reach a double version of 700 points and nobody did this .
most of you . miss gamers are 33 years old , not eight years , and if we look at the most profound demographics of the ocean &apos;s field , the players are older adults .
imagine whose vision is very , very good .
these players even have many other benefits in terms of attention , and a part of attention , which is also improved , is our ability to track objects in our environment .
i want to ask you to remember this result , and to put it in the context of another group of the other group of people , a group that actually looked up in our society , which is the &apos; 70s .
let me show you this step of a task called mental speeds .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just make all kinds of programs of the special case , which we look at .
so it was a big , very complex project that i didn &apos;t even know if it was at all .
so wolfram alpha knows about many and lots of things .
on one side , we have mathematica , with the kind of precise , enlightened language and a large network of the creation developed capacity , capable of doing a lot of lines .
so , with physical engineering , we &apos;re basically used to go to the world and see that certain materials make sense of certain technological purposes and so on .
a few years ago , i was pretty excited about discovery that there are candidates with incredibly simple rules that are successful , and the general relativity of relativity and gravity and at least evidence of quantum theory and gravity and at least evidence of quantum theory .
sw : i think .
and during that time , i actually lost more relatives , and teachers who are going to me , to hiv / aids .
they jump up . they wear red clothes .
and my mother was a woman , she didn &apos;t have a proper stand on property and automatically , which had my family , anyway , so he had the right .
and the day before the actual ceremony we were , we were excited , and they didn &apos;t fall in the night .
he was wearing prayer and that in a village that didn &apos;t even have a lot of the streets . it worked very attractive .
i promised him to be a girl , i would come back and do everything that you would ask me to ask .
when it was pregnant before the marriage , the mother was made for it , and punished .
as we speak here , 125 girls will never be murdered again .
consumers that represent the 72 percent of the american gdp , actually , they start to release the banks and companies to get back to their own life , in daily life , to free themselves , to take care of commitment and risks that are moving forward .
and what you see here is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we actually step down and basically in the future of education , the future children of our households .
and the first thing is , they have gone up 48 percent , the cornell institute .
we &apos;re also seeing a trend of tourism , which is , right ?
one of them is the most important of community and neighborhood , and it &apos;s a family that &apos;s going to be a support .
we also observe a big amount of water .
the trend for the design system is enormous .
and then we take the phenomenon of pachycephalosaurus .
and then i came up with the question , is i the only thing that &apos;s doing ?
you could exploit them .
this is what i do in my life -- telling stories , writing novels , and today i want to share with you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also about some supernatural creatures that are the most powerful .
our main community could be eradicated . our hearts could be slaughtered , and our most important ones could be broadcast , if we &apos;re in our cultural media system too long .
i first came to the first time , like i call it , &quot; representative a magnetic pulse . &quot;
i &apos;m not an immigrant , no refugee or a refugee , i &apos;m going to ask , why do i do that , but the driver &apos;s butt process allows me to invent myself .
he wanted to see an manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story was got to be a huge thing , because i was cheated .
literature has to lead to the other side .
i could be a novel about a muslim woman , and maybe it will be a happy story , and i may write in my next book , and i might write about a little bit of a gay professor in norway .
so you &apos;re going to get out of the world . you &apos;re already taking existing songs , you can take it into little bits , it forms these pieces , you can mix them together and get a new song , but this new song is clear from old songs .
instead , these laws and laws are the more awkward comparison of the property .
it &apos;s a very reactive , but i &apos;m going to summarize what it was called . the alarm &apos;s alarm , the telephone &apos;s name , by the phone by the time you &apos;re going to switch a symbol with your finger .
our creativity comes from the outside , not by inside .
and then they say , &quot; okay , but how do you see your address ? &quot;
but in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the newspaper .
what &apos;s beautiful , you can probably see this limb , a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a sound of light that is coming out of the limb .
our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
now , this led to a understanding of the nuclear structure , because it &apos;s going to be so versatile that atoms have a single core , with a peer , which is circle it .
this picture shows a galaxy , a computer company , with , well , 100 billion stars like ours .
i think it can ultimately be the most important ideas for us , and the way we think about our space in the universe , and really the value of our country &apos;s worth of life .
this is here . this is home . that &apos;s what we &apos;re .
and with each tap and every touch of the screen , we &apos;re going to make a look like a little bit of the screen and wilbur and wilbur of our personal information all over our way through the digital forest .
when our daughter sat on the front of the day , i asked her , &quot; will you put a lot of value on your school , &quot; is it worth a lot of musical competence ? &quot;
we can &apos;t even be a bad argument here .
well , i want to take you on this journey .
and because i was so much , and i talked to you , i decided i was going to talk to my 27th , i was not going to talk to a day .
and they don &apos;t speak ...
and i explained to a friend who understood my sign of language that i was john francis , that i was walking through life , that i didn &apos;t speak and that this was the last time somebody would translate my sign .
well , i &apos;m going to get my backpack again .
i started talking again because i had studied a lot of time .
but the most important thing was that i was thinking about my silence , but never about my decision , just to use my feet .
and i grew up and grew up in north korea .
sometimes i found little jobs in exchange against food .
i kept worried about it , and i would go back to that .
i felt so powerless because i had so much to eat in america , but my father died to hunger .
but i think that the gesture of love and care can also save life of another joseph and thousands of other people who still have hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings , but this was much stronger than i expected , and making it easy to get to be more competent and also more than an industrial engineering system .
but then i was very disappointed with my job as an architect because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for society , but for privileged people , the government , the government , contractors .
and then , in 1995 , there was a big earthquake in kobe , in japan .
so i wonder what is a permanent and a temporary building ?
but this is really necessary .
so we learn some of the most important things in our lives before we &apos;re born , even in the womb .
so fetuses even learn the specific language that &apos;s going to be in the world , which is born in the world .
it &apos;s a mixture of the effects that are so insecure and curious , like the woman itself .
why should malnutrition lead to the womb of disease ?
you can also see the other eyes , but you can see with other eyes .
this trust in the brain is essential for every kind of mass of influence .
the audience will be on the street , which is very logical , but not with the rest of what &apos;s happening before their eyes . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , maybe it &apos;s going to take us to smile .
you may remember that as the most popular , ok , and then when the biggest deal of all time was described .
if you &apos;re a high animal in velcro , and somebody says , &quot; what do you actually get to eliminating hunger in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start an ad campaign ?
this is actually a strategy and i don &apos;t argue that strategy plays a role .
for me , all of this became the music .
now , if i use my software , the camera is going to take the laser , and i &apos;m going to get the point of the brain &apos;s point of view , and you &apos;ve got a whiteboard .
i remember the poor needed to be a little bit more mature -- food , clothing , shelter -- which they didn &apos;t have .
i even felt a moment of shame .
now , since i heard him , i was excited about various reasons .
i was not asked by a donation , which is what i &apos;m normally asked .
it &apos;s about the history of the history of the poor and it &apos;s about giving us a way to engage what your dignity would be , a partnership that is not a kind of a partnership that is based on a traditional kind of donation , can happen crazy .
it &apos;s a very strong combination of a very strong combination .
now , the very beginning is , in the beginning , and it &apos;s kind of reflective to me that it &apos;s just a vehicle , just a tool .
how does the future of humanity look like ?
now , i &apos;m going to turn to the second big question : are we alone or is there other lives in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions , that we &apos;ve done remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
look at this .
here are photos of me .
the rate is doubling every 18 months and every 18 months of the world &apos;s population knows that this is moore &apos;s law .
but what about them ? what about them ?
they ski in their saucers over the sky , and occasionally they kill people for experiments that would not agree their parents .
so we &apos;re interested in these things .
and earlier generations , these experiments couldn &apos;t do anything .
and i found out that the first technology came from the street to millions of years ago in the form of a few years ago .
so , we can learn a lot of it .
and i see the child &apos;s , and i &apos;m trying to protect my kid , because with a child , you don &apos;t do any minister alone , even a minister .
and secondly , she says that she had a stand-up gang , but some adaptations for the climb of trees .
and so , until now , our ancestors have been about our ancestors in principle of adults , because the fossils , the most sophisticated , missing .
the most important thing about the most powerful is the origin of humanity in the long ethiopia , and he talks about how he found the oldest skeleton of a humanoid child , and what we can learn in africa about our human beings .
and if all of the rules should be , you need to have a useful system to address and the way we &apos;ve noticed , and it &apos;s also a very useful system to be controlled .
it &apos;s considered high seas , because the continent of the main demands of the demands is .
we need to work locally , but also all of sea acidification .
we need to create a new paradigm of caution and respect .
carol mcchrystal says , &quot; i would pay to do what i do . &quot;
that was a pretty good idea .
and to say , i &apos;m a journalist , no technologist , so i want to design a little bit of a sketch , like the present and the future .
and finally , i think we need to think about whether we want that to be our reality -- and if what it means for our idea of life , and for everything that comes out .
it looks like crude oil .
the symptoms of complex are that you have the strong and more important opinion that you have to have the right solution , no matter how hard the problem is .
cesar and i tried writing an article for the new york times and to explain how it works .
of course we can .
and make a lot of money .
it &apos;s more than the rate of loss of americans .
we &apos;ll try and do that . probably all right .
it &apos;s immediately gone . &quot;
and the empirical du collider was always trying to prove it , but he could never prove the guess .
i &apos;m saying that our approach is simply not portable .
china has achieved that in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even make slower .
the future is automatically degraded .
yes , it will become ugly , and yes , it &apos;s happening -- with safety in our lifetime -- but we &apos;re more than capable of getting to us , that we are on our appearance .
and here they come into play .
and what we need to think about is that if you &apos;re dancing in the air , what &apos;s next ?
and we thought we can put these debt on our children , but imagine you before you .
everything else is a lot of the time .
this is the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what stage the development is going to be .
that &apos;s not supposed to be amazing or ?
all we have is a lot of the time .
you will be able to focus your listening , perhaps the sensitivity , or you can do a series of things that we can &apos;t do .
it &apos;s not a thousand years away .
we should say these cheap , simple , simple , simple , and not to use them for their children . &quot;
and here we can see this overall section .
we can &apos;t risk risk of losing customers .
he &apos;s only got 500 and able to have 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a huge farm full of plastic , which they got , and he said , &quot; come back in a week when you &apos;re still sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the kind of web -- the things we all talk about -- is a little less than 5,000 days old .
of course , there &apos;s been the internet for more than 5,000 days -- the web only has 5,000 days .
so if we say , the machine we &apos;re going to be doing is a human brain , a human brain , if we look at the rate , there &apos;s six billion more plastic groups in the world .
now it &apos;s not -- if you do a chart and things at work , a word document , you &apos;re not part of the web but you will be part of the machine . you &apos;ll be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people will be the existing sense of machine . &quot; in a certain sense .
it &apos;s going to be on the level of parts or ideas , or words , if you want to evaporate .
the last point i wanted to talk about is the idea that we &apos;re going to be able to get .
third , it will be ubiquitous , and we &apos;re going to fill our entire environment and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i was convinced that the second one was the second of jesus christ that it was sun valdez moon , and that i was particularly surrounded by god and being prepared by god .
these are the dead of the fish .
and it allows everything . it makes sense all the way .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas like we are doing things .
this is a project that we &apos;ve just completed in a major commercial device that came out of this process , which is the result of a variety of forces that are developing .
and that led directly to another project .
it &apos;s actually a false attitude because the hybrid is probably more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas are contributing to a process of young people .
and finally , one of the most interesting projects -- a computer company .
each of you is going to be your neighbors .
so , as we have to pay school school .
so we have a big brain , a big advantage , because we can influence our environment .
my story , is the two brains . it may surprise you , our gut has a brain &apos;s brain .
this is very , very important , because there &apos;s inflammation .
we &apos;ve learned to talk to the big brain , taste and reward , as you know .
he said , &quot; you know , we were all like animals , and then we don &apos;t . &quot;
these are men and women who can still name 250 stars in the sky sky .
of course , the most popular monks have said that .
the main line , the post , on the sun , is actually a very high , which is the light that makes light on the sacred of altruism , which seems to be called the &quot; desalination picchu . &quot;
if you pray to the dead , you make these gestures , you get these gestures to the sky that you &apos;re going to climb up to the sky .
here &apos;s the place where the great mother has the most important in the world , which has been creating the mountains and created the home , which they call the heart of the world .
it &apos;s unique to human imagination .
this material that you all know , is a lot of the time , but i think it &apos;s more like toxic white stuff .
i slow up there , you fit there , because in a hundred years my body can return to the earth .
it &apos;s a waste .
you can apply it anywhere in the world , and don &apos;t have to care about the world &apos;s or not for the most important , because you have a lot of alternatives .
first , they start atoms in a special bottle .
i started a competition four years ago , called &quot; dance your ph.d. &quot;
my country is about 15 trillion dollars .
and that &apos;s -- -- that &apos;s a lot of the speakers that are going to be like all the speakers and all the ones that come to me .
and she thought about my work in mathematical models , which should be provided a sense of evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience may not like head-tail-tail -- from deep , cultural reasons , they think it &apos;s boring -- and find a different pattern of the way that head-tail-head .
you can think about two ways of thinking about it .
if you throw a coin , you get a sequence of head and number .
and then , more secular , more difficult to be more powerful because of that you &apos;re dealing with uncertainty .
and only one percent is wrong .
he said , &quot; i suppose that after a sudden , the probability of death is the probability of another death . &quot;
not as improbable as one in 73 million , but still quite unlikely .
the whole quality quality , the most robust impact on the industrial process has been carried by statistics .
the most important thing is saved hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide .
a smart power cycle prevents injury because the power is always made of , until a smart carbon system is recognized .
but , on the other hand , china is a computer designer , and a term is going to go to a sense of a product .
you have facebook , we have a lot of time .
yet the pinnacle itself can create a very strong force , which is never in china &apos;s history .
so , chinese view of this kind of state of communication as real as the only headlines , not just as the headlines .
how a big ted , isn &apos;t it ?
so in the last three years , in the last three years , through the u.s. rescue system , they really changed more and more transparent because they have no access to the data .
more chinese and human rights , and human rights , as you have a milestone , rather than one of america &apos;s privilege .
many of you know that the beethoven &apos;s seventh symphony was .
i don &apos;t say they can live in life .
girl : well , my sister can pretty nerves .
the acoustics of music is much more complicated than the language .
this is a violin .
and it seems like his favorite way of being out of the way to try and understand the death cause , why there was a sound of the voice , and it &apos;s got a skull on the sides of the pages .
cl : joseph is phenomenal . he &apos;s brilliant .
if i &apos;m going to go , in this kind of comic auditorium , i see a special audience .
in many countries , it &apos;s another thing .
in this critical point in the dutch history , my father was at the bank of the village bank in the near river .
the rate of civil wars and oppression has been down since the end of the cold war .
my soldiers use their weapons as tools of peace .
peter van : why i took a gun
this program gets a form and then then then then put 250 dna sequences .
this is a very crude in the middle of the high school , in the middle of the gdp .
you can &apos;t make it weird .
i &apos;m very interested in both .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example of this , but there &apos;s actually a theoretical rationale for why technology evolves in the way that technology is evolving .
now , evolution needed to have hundreds of thousands of years , and because of this interaction , evolution is basically the technology of the nanoscale species to create the next stage in technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; so we can make the third dimension .
over the last 50 years , we had a year of information technology 28 percent of the year .
another big revolution is the most important .
so , to go back to our exponential growth of computing , 1,000 dollars of computing are about the brain of a insect or a mouse .
and in the year of olympus , we will reach the full divorce of these trends , and they have to recognize how often the outrage was made in the form of technology -- faster and faster when we get to this point .
you can bring blessing and randomness .
they &apos;re harder .
they were removed from the prison .
because there &apos;s nothing in there . well , it &apos;s nothing supposed to be .
dopamine is apparently the stuff that is related to the brain .
and we call this schizophrenia .
and he was so friendly to post and give us the resolution .
i mentioned in our little thought earlier , they &apos;re a little bit of a sudden in the african plain .
the 11th 11th has a more mature . it &apos;s a conspiracy .
and we have our own software system , and we have a product of a product .
i was not as good as he , but we managed to get the tar n , a laser , tracy chapman and bruce chapman and bruce chapman and bruce chapman , and that was a great experience .
they always said , &quot; let &apos;s say the truth &quot; and beat us .
musicians and activist peter gabriel discusses his personal motivation , with the most human health care system for human rights and telling stories of active design .
next we asked ourselves how that does that ?
he recognizes the problem and knowing how to deal with it , and the dance is his name of his own , which allows him to orient .
the beetle climbing a lot of rare times on the pill when you wear up on the pill when you &apos;re not wearing .
here &apos;s our favorite experimenter .
play a computer change and watch what happens .
this is the universe of stephen hawking .
thank you .
and the argument that it &apos;s fun is that it &apos;s fun to fall into these big adventures , right with my experience .
or , &quot; nice . you know , my grandmother makes a watch next year to antarctica .
so the whole purpose of the presentation of the presentation is to convince the vc that they are the entrepreneurs in which they are investing and they &apos;re going to make a lot of money .
and besides the experience , a company or a company to lead -- it doesn &apos;t have to be a company .
there &apos;s no financially support in which there was no problems .
from there , they &apos;re using them -- on a solid , nice path to the top . right from the beginning to the end .
if i happen to know someone who has made a device like this --
no , they &apos;re not .
then they give me a quick double reactor .
even if the competition works old , the competition .
it was hopefully positive , positive , positive , more positive .
if you follow my intention , you will have a more powerful presentation , very , very , very , very , to get to the street , who you are and to bring to emotionally .
i didn &apos;t know that , that &apos;s pretty cool .
statistically , one of them is one of them .
if you &apos;re doing something , you might have a effect on it .
and then if you have enough , you can click another link .
we &apos;re at the end of the table , the last place , as the culture , not estimates of innovation .
like we think and behave , our power system makes our own waste .
we have a meme meme -- to be serious .
but forgive me , the problems today are not the problems of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the biggest biggest ones ?
it &apos;s very ambiguous .
our thinking is backwards .
by a drastic change , change , like transparency , change , like , for example , and collaboration , collaboration , and not to be able to engage these things , these things are focused on outcomes .
because the only way that the only way that things are always made is the only way to get rid of the old way to get rid of the old little , and find new creative solutions for the problems of today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we should do it together , and if we do that , and if we do that , the ideas of play can make us transform a bulgaria thing .
the magazine for the computer project is , i think , &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master took me to the design , because the most popular was the time that we were .
after i had a gesture of the gesture , they were very -- i was accepted and i worked there for about six months .
nine days ago , i had a fire .
you know -- all of the stuff .
my kids , the child , and henry .
we were looking at a lot of magazines , and we made our homework , but where we were also , we were surrounded by images like this .
this picture was literally taken in seconds after i was placed in the poor , and i brought it over .
rg : oh oh .
av : taboo number three : you don &apos;t talk about his pregnancy , but i &apos;m going to talk today about my talk .
the general opinion is that every aspect of my life has become better , since i &apos;ve been in the wonders of birth and family .
but you realize that you &apos;re going to be able to lose control in a wonderful way , what we mean , our lives are very much meaning , and what &apos;s extremely satisfying .
rg + av : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s a consequence of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve seen all of this star , and we &apos;ve seen the &quot; star &quot; with the world &apos;s .
imagine , big , late , late , now , to hear how personal they would play . john blackmore walker shows how images can be analyzed on the exact exact exact walls and the most precise ones to play them on the top of the wing .
now , since then we &apos;ve experienced a time of extraordinary economic growth , the longest rise in the history of this country .
but now , a few months later , how good politicians are still going to be in it , &quot; to bite the sulfur apple without chasing the mine , &quot; as it was somebody , you can &apos;t hide their uncertainty .
well , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i met this guy , one day , a little bit messy , just messy man who was fed from tomato soup and held iron for completely being avoided .
but interestingly , the future is a future where society is a few tricks of capitalism , which is how to memorize dna , and then we tried to put things into society by trying to , and then the ones who work , and they work , and they work .
i want to show you a fascinating new hypothesis today , and some surprising new insights i &apos;ve been working on , about the context between the structure of language that you talk about , and your tendency to save .
and if i want to speak right , it forces me , constantly thinking about it .
well , this is a real theory of theory .
please push this device so that you can be sensitive to your dominant hand so i can measure your own color .
it &apos;s the present pleasure in exchange for future pain .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important the ability to communicate about generations is to communicate .
we &apos;re all in the way that we have a fall .
but i &apos;m against use them as a representative .
but they didn &apos;t get the results that they wanted .
at the same time , i was on the field of the computer company , although i was a ph.d. in kuwait .
people and the giraffes and the highway and birds and all the ones here are going up . these are people , livestock and pets .
we focused on more serious problems of the future and produced products for the company .
let &apos;s see the next video .
that flew around the party last night , and -- you can see how it just is just going to be a little bit of a time , and you can see everyone who you want to do .
and he was dissatisfied about how people practiced the buddhist religion in india .
and he goes back to the village , and he &apos;s a broken man .
and he has to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , the smell and everything .
the animals are in one of their lives . people are people .
we &apos;re all out of it . we &apos;re taking the feeling of memory to a mother and a long time in this meditation .
and you think about how the things are , if you &apos;re happy , if you &apos;re happy .
and of course , they &apos;re cruel and they &apos;re very vulnerable to others .
although the change in your mindset is something that makes you a difference for other creatures , you feel these new quality in you , and it &apos;s already helping you , and it &apos;s going to show you as a model .
so the coffee cup , or the cup of the cup , is using tools to get the public health tools .
interestingly , the complexity is very high .
we &apos;ve heard about bill gates recently .
so it &apos;s very , very simple when you know how to read it .
well , let me close with four general remarks , an example and two milestones .
and i don &apos;t want to stop the details , but in the lower right corner , you see an example of what we have for it .
do you start to do that ?
and the result is that the main process of what jimmy had talked about , what jimmy has been talking about , or better , how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things will always be less able to be able to get it in collaboration with the most expensive .
so for example , let &apos;s take astronomy , which yochai had mentioned .
it &apos;s also going to be a professional argument , professional arguments .
so there &apos;s no argument of two camp , but between these camps , there will be all interesting positions that are taken by people .
it costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to put their favorite people and actually have a team , and then they did it : between new zealand and spain .
and the first thing i thought was to thank him for it .
but the truth is that life is happening right here .
so people were calling up and have news like this : &quot; here &apos;s what they &apos;re going on . &quot;
he said , &quot; i &apos;m like batman , to be true of anonymity . &quot;
and the one who did not have done a data , so that turned out that she was just moved into another town and adopted a new job .
and in the last 35 years , i studied human behavior on the basis of everything different , from genes over brain implants , dopamine and statements to the end of the ocean .
some of you have it . and it &apos;s dependent on gender .
this was one of those cases , because there was no force under their ancestors , but at my father .
they &apos;re like that , as you can only be .
by the way , i &apos;ve got an email that &apos;s going to be , in which we &apos;ve been the last part of atlas .
and these guys are the weak force that may be known at least .
so if you want to know why the sky is blue or why atomic nuclei are going to stick together , you should basically be in the way that dna has the shape that you have now -- you know ?
the comparison is that people in this room represent the higgs boson .
but it &apos;s really that with this theory that the physical media theory seems to unite at the big bang , one absolutely wonderful prediction is not done with the goal that this is happening , but it seems to be doing it .
it created this civilization , this wonderful picture , the darkness in light and it allows it to see civilization from all of it .
another big insight came from a study of the adversarial state university in 2010 , the baseball maps of the national league players , from the 1950s .
in a similar study in germany , researchers use an fmri to measure an fmri in order to measure the way they had the experimenter to be smiling .
&quot; because the colors that they wash , they &apos;re not the european standard . &quot;
&quot; safer ? why ? are there more policemen in the middle of this ? &quot;
we built the light , the people who were the people who were people who were gathering in the field of people who were in the foreign field , they were going to be abroad when they were going to be in order to make their cause heat .
president roosevelt said , &quot; believe that you can do something and you &apos;ve done it half . &quot;
all over port-au-prince came to entrepreneurs and offered donor farms for mobile phones .
a graph for the transformative power of technology is in kibera .
by 2015 , it will give three billion smartphone to the world .
in the shops of the environment , batteries and bread were more mature .
this river of time is embedded in everything : in the erosion of a computer , in the amazon , the kiss , who &apos;s in the rose .
so read a interview with a writer ?
and also , if i look at the big bear , i remember how i was going to be a kid at his head to go to his head , not to slide from his shoulders , and i feel like this kid .
we &apos;ve seen , as creative technology can be , and in our lives , we can do those solutions , innovations and moments that don &apos;t have the flow of time , but again .
my mother was a little bit of a time .
in every single refugee camp , they had to write the soldiers who my older brother mark mark , who was nine , take a child &apos;s name and wanted to make a child child .
and i should do it alone .
take something you want , from the suitcase .
then i ended up in algeria , because i don &apos;t mean my feelings .
thank you .
so almost everything on earth is being wiped out about five times .
svante mandelbrot has the answer .
why should this be a role ?
so , in theory , we can grow any organ from any cell .
here &apos;s the rise of the rise in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the conclusion .
if the hubble dimensions turn along with the same speed , the robot goes .
and you see how robust the control is .
and he makes it , while he &apos;s picking up obstacles .
they take their neighbors true .
this is showing that we double the most sophisticated , talented , 100 years of , in which we can get them to form teams , how they can see here .
but the robot can also figure out where it wants to go .
i can feel that . but there &apos;s so much and i want to expand your horizon , consciousness open and change your view of honeybees .
this has been a huge problem for many years , basically since the late &apos; 80s , the most different , which is the most different viruses , bacteria and food companies with themselves .
they don &apos;t experience that .
they take the chefs for their courts , and the honey -- there are the apple -- they use the honey on their bars .
the bee dies . honeybees die when they stick , so they didn &apos;t want to do it .
okay , now , what &apos;s the question : why is this ?
of course , we also have it , especially in the last decade , which is the world with a dense chain of the soup , with a global trade .
and never before were so many people in this fact .
in fact , not many of you know that our bread was not european invention .
and especially the meat in the field and china drives the water lanes up .
agriculture science has been for most people , and here are not many farmers among them that are bad to be , the environment , to be able to destroy the environment .
everything is going on .
and so while i do my bread , i &apos;m doing it , and i have it , and i &apos;m trying to burn my hands .
it also needs to be to keep the long time on the land , and it &apos;s available available to repair materials and materials .
you take somebody like me , a scientist , analyze and designed a new technology , and i &apos;m sure the quantitative design of the institutional design .
because i hope you &apos;re going to take this from here , a new connection with nature .
this was a couple of days ago in aviation .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
this is from last year .
but , in fact , a marketer was one of them , and shekhar kapur turned a film over her , and he was going to see her , and i &apos;ll see you .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but this is a choreographer , but it &apos;s a self-fulfilling .
this is a patient &apos;s patient who was 73 -- he was actually needed a bypass , but he decided to do this .
i like this slide because you &apos;re talking about what people really motivated to change , and what not .
if you eat a high school meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a very small one . americans eat more fat because ever more carbs , so the percentage lower , but the percentage lower , but the actual number , the goal is , it &apos;s both to reduce .
one of the most exciting studies of studies found that 70 percent of people were clogged , 65 percent of people had bad breath , 54 percent had a headache -- that &apos;s not a healthy diet .
on the other hand , everything is intimacy , the power of it is the power of power .
i hope he doesn &apos;t hang on .
the film is based on a wooden of f. scott scott &apos;s film .
two main people were involved in the project : warner brothers and dance .
and we had a lot of passion to do the most important and technology .
so we &apos;re so generous to move .
the number seemed to be infinitely .
and these are the data that we get , and then it &apos;s used for the model .
and so the finished picture looked like the movie was used .
this was a very , very , very early sample .
and we found this , in the middle of karnataka .
and it has a own brain system .
people from the tribal statements are going to overcome these cruel , highly popular past where they lived in their lives .
we were too beautiful -- two sins as a driver -- and imagine that this is a sea of sand , 40 degrees centigrade , one water bottle .
i think that camel is the best portuguese animal on the world . &quot;
and they use them as similar as we see our own business system .
we weigh our animals .
so i &apos;ll show you another movie .
i don &apos;t have to go down until my body temperature is going to continue 40 degrees of c -- enough to get a egg .
so , thank you for inviting me .
start a meeting with a poem . it would be an idea .
but how would you like to do it if you never knew how to do the next day , like a living god , the world , or whether you &apos;re sitting down the bottom of the water , or whether you &apos;re sitting down from the wallpaper with your little baby &apos;s little baby &apos;s little bit ?
who could sleep in this night ?
but you knew that judy was given $ 150,000 dollars a movie that the french d was the french army , and blaise pascal had been cleaned up the room -- no wait , i mean he invented the calculator ?
at the end , they sat in a tree , and a blow the hand to another .
and the human genome is more than that , but if you take these two columns , probably not much more likely to get .
and also , we have the problem that we can &apos;t build construction , that you can &apos;t build construction to a single elephant .
one component of it is understanding the understanding of this : &quot; the ability to understand feelings of the other and to share . &quot;
so now we &apos;re studying more complex expressions . here &apos;s consolation .
that the test doesn &apos;t come well for you .
there &apos;s a very simple task that you have to do .
a philosopher even wrote that it was impossible that the only one would have a sense for fairness , because fairness was invented in the french revolution .
now it &apos;s not a lonely crazy , it &apos;s not two crazy , three is a lot and a lot of power .
the last decade i spent that , i &apos;ve been getting pain and humiliation , hopefully for a good thing that &apos;s the most important thing .
and i have to say , thank god .
so i was listening to it in a way .
over the years , the serious way to do this is to make a serious deal .
a.j. jacobs : how healthy life is almost killed
and i think that many scientists are sharing this view .
really cool thing .
now these studies are scientifically concerned , and they &apos;re being beaten , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
ask the story of the story that &apos;s not going to tell you .

somebody who sits on the seat next to you -- that &apos;s okay in a nazi , but you would be on a street seat , and somebody would be so dense to you , then you would get a little bit of it .
the dalai lama always likes to say -- he says , if you can get the idea of the idea of the idea of the brain &apos;s idea , it &apos;s because you realize that you can and your pain and your pain and your pain , eventually you &apos;re a little bit smaller .

a man was a man who was a shot for the whole world that became a symbol of resistance .
but what would you not have to do , if you had the modern communications , to create a sense that against the wrong , that was going to be done immediately , right immediately ?
combine the power of a global ethic with power of our ability to communicate on global level and organize global , and to organize the challenges that we &apos;re now in our communication and most of global nature .

you can move on very different amounts of light -- you vary in the world &apos;s movement , the movement of the surface and the existing value of the body .
this is a car accident , as a car crash .
boy : hurdy-gurdy .
let &apos;s slow up to see the spines in action .
mark cutkosky at stanford , one of my partners , is an extraordinary engineer that was called a form of manufacturing called manufacturing manufacturing , where he can wash claws directly into an artificial foot .
you see almost like aliens out of it , and the secret , what they stick , are their toes .
here we go the band-aid .
these are the structures that allow spines , the water , and the most important , to be able to express , very challenging surfaces .
so , the long way of generating beautiful songs that are serving as a police engineer and males also allow females to find each other and choose a partner .
so when dolphins are less than 20 feet away , they have to make less than half the time the whistles is going to make .
if we think about marine marine animals like dolphins like dolphins , we need to be aware of the consequences of our interventions in clear , which we thought we were quite safe .
after the most popular state , the marine marine species made the system available to the world to experience what scientists could hear .
you just hear the low frequencies .
if males and females use this signal to find a partner and they &apos;re spread , imagine what the implications of the population would have been the kind of population of the population .
as ships can be done , they found that with a better amount of time , they can reduce noise of this noise to 90 percent .
they &apos;re going to get 50 percent .
we see strangers , we see strangers solar systems , 300 times , and it &apos;s going to be more and more . and they &apos;re not like us .
you &apos;ve all got the opportunity to do .
we observe a continual increase in the men .
and obviously , there &apos;s one that looks a hundred .
with initiatives like the 100 dollars laptop , it &apos;s a lot of the time that we &apos;re going to bring a whole new generation of people into the old computer buildings .
thank you .
i think nothing is the problem .
and our daily life is , in a remarkable condition , in a remarkable state , we say in a long-term state .
normally , it &apos;s one or two per year .
and there &apos;s one .
but we &apos;re much more sensitive .
part of the challenge was to try and get rhythm and space by not only my hands -- in juggling , a lot of the time -- but the rhythm of my body and the feet , and the balls , and the balls with my feet .
and then they &apos;re playing crazy .
ok , because they &apos;re not understanding what a computer company is , i give you a little hint .
now , again , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
you have somebody up here who is the most important principle of doing this , ok ?
pop -- and then it &apos;s going to be quiet . just a little number of time .
and in space and straight in the room , they work in other ways .
and then they &apos;re going to scale .
in this year -- you might please show the slides -- in this year , we &apos;re wearing the most prolific with us , a project that we helped to have the causal player .
we can put this on a computer map that allows you to put another information on the clothing , while you &apos;re putting these online types .
( scott adams : i &apos;ve noticed that i &apos;m the foremost expert in the world &apos;s head .
and we &apos;re also going to be familiar with a new product tonight , and it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s shown in public .
now , the farmers can only be in the rainy season , and not in the most competitive harvest .
electrons disappear in a kind of a kind of water and then still still , and energy can &apos;t see .

potatoes , potatoes have 48 chromosomes . have you known that ?
good . atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
and somebody said to him , &quot; well , what &apos;s the point of the story ?
we have about four years of time .
if google is a book , they put it in a very beautiful format .
i &apos;ll give you an example .
suddenly , in the middle of the &apos; 40s , everybody was excited .
but you can &apos;t think of it , it &apos;s going to be a good thing .
but also many of the right , the same thing that apparently has been fixed by propaganda .
if you go to the cursor , it means a &quot; eureka &quot; with a a.
if i walk on this pink sound for longer than some minutes , you would literally stop listening to listening .
many people come to headphones , but that changes big , public spaces like this , shared , shared , different personal personal technology .
you can also do this on a beautiful place like a lake .
and finally , an acronym .
and i said , &quot; this is my job . &quot;
thank you so much for being here . we &apos;re all so grateful . &quot;
and that &apos;s what they went to .
because they were not at the sidewalk , and they couldn &apos;t see the exchange that happened between me and my favorite review , a exchange that seemed fair , but they were alien .
now , i &apos;m telling you , in the last year , there was a lot of competition in the last year , because the arab spring is still spreading , the most powerful , the most common thing is ... what else ?
this photograph was even initiated in a police station , and on the floor , they &apos;re the most cosmopolitan of people who were tracking from the police .
the kids just make photographs in a class that are going to get them , they paste them on the top of the road .
in today &apos;s talk , it &apos;s about the brain and , yay , somewhere out there is a computer designer .
this is something that we can work on in our lifetime , i believed a difference , and i tried to get out of the back of the boat , and i was trying to get out of the back of the boat .
but sometimes science has some other properties that you really do really interesting .
what are more data that we bring ?
there &apos;s something that we believe that it is obvious , but wrong .
it &apos;s so that intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we don &apos;t look at the alligator as a very intelligent , not in a human way .
in humans , we &apos;ve developed the most sophisticated part of the internet &apos;s name , with the name of the neocortex , which is nature &apos;s worth of view .
it &apos;s not that you &apos;re going to look at it and say , &quot; what am i seeing ?
not like a computer box . not like a computer box .
these are the things that are going to come first .
we need a little police , we need something military , but only to defense .
you can see it on your crack . &quot;
they traveled because they were the time of the election outside the country .
this is a little bit of a design of the world .
and then , when she was covering the door , grandma said , &quot; no , no , no , no .
it &apos;s like , you know , hand .
these group uses three , every one .
it &apos;s real .
she managed to learn english and learn this as a language .
the computer already , and in one of three participants .
if you think , you think differently than the employers of the united states , which was actually part of our experiment , because that &apos;s what we did .
we repeated the experiment with the same groups , but we added a fifth between the enlightenment , and we &apos;re going to be a half between the way we &apos;re dealing with the data and the actual beginning of the air .
the price for this is the displacement of paradise .
and they moved and they cleaned up on each other and they went to each other and they leave their arms on each other .
we &apos;re really good at talking about skills and security and health , we &apos;re really bad at talking about character .

i don &apos;t really feel like emotions .
the first gift , or talent , is a lot of the way -- the ability to upload other people &apos;s minds and find out what they offer .
they have a silver humility .
that &apos;s what the unconscious is looking for .
we found them between the world &apos;s work , raped by many , many men , i don &apos;t know how many .
where does your journey start ?
and that it &apos;s not normal to live in a home .
what was my challenge ?
they need their empathy .
lexicography : the process dictionaries run .
well , first of all , i admit the queen , because it &apos;s funny .
online dictionaries have to be different .
the bad words -- look at a place when someone thinks about a place and then it doesn &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be , &quot; this map sucks ! &quot;
you think , &quot; ok , if we think that words are tools that we use to give our thoughts , how should you know that that &apos;s a hammer better than a hammer ?
the patriot alliance has 33 different proportions for &quot; set . &quot;
and then there &apos;s this mike bieber , mike richards lives in britain .
i &apos;ve got the whole time &quot; the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary . &quot;
so , i &apos;m going to go a chair .
and , to make a long story short , i &apos;m finally .
and with this piece of play , while this three days , you start to understand : why am i listening to all of this stuff ?
they &apos;re maybe from a ted speaker and we can take the conversation on the year , and next year , after the same intellectual and emotional journey , the same intellectual and emotional journey .
the manufacturers don &apos;t have the most sophisticated in their cheap , because they &apos;re not sure what the public would start with a so precise downturn , which could actually fold on the palm of their hand .
and there was cargill , and it was , you know , that &apos;s not what was done , and it was technically not able to find the channel .
instead of taking care of the world &apos;s office , you can do it .
and , &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
we call ourselves a &amp; amp ; rao and we live in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this work is the cartoon of a computer of a human .
we debate the case &quot; what the world needs now , is nuclear -- right or wrong ?
and now , there &apos;s only three main points of power for this -- coal and gas , which is almost all around -- and nuclear .
we have become the russian masterpieces by being transformed in electricity .
the emissions are equivalent emissions of all greenhouse gases , and particles that cause warming , and it transformed to co2 .
now , if you look at the fact that the prevalence of nuclear weapons is associated with the prevalence of nuclear energy , because we know that india and pakistan had nuclear weapons in the world of nuclear weapons .
and the area is much larger , but the average size is smaller .
the reality is that 21 states have nuclear power , right ?
and in the senate of the united states , we need the support of both parties -- just one or two voices to be the global warming in the senate , and this room can help .
we &apos;re only not going to get enough energy out of renewables .
i was worried about the 10 years in the past .
thank you .
this was -- my motivation was swallowed by apollo .
for the first time , we have enough wealth in the hands of some people , and the available technology , which allows us to explore the exploration of space .
26 groups from seven countries took the competition , every one of the things that was made between one and 25 million dollars .
so , we can bring them to space station .
and the advantage for the funders is the sum of the most expensive and social media .
would you surprise us , so amazing ?
that means that areas can cut itself . they can be incredibly small .
a challenge was to express these new algorithmic order in a column .
what i didn &apos;t know about time because we only saw the outside , was that the surfaces continue to keep on the surface , within the column , and that was a pretty surprising discovery .
inspired by the process of cell division , michael mcchrystal writes about the incredible , amazing forms with millions of surfaces , not a human being , but you can build it in your understanding , but you could build our understanding of architecture .
so look at this picture here -- many forms of the screen here for you .
it &apos;s a very rare disease .
this is a drug that has been developed for cancer .
you can see , the chip mimics even the most expensive .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s led to young people .
and i think that many people here in the room are in the same position as i am .
so i think that women in our society are going to be leaders because they realize that it &apos;s very important for their future generations to get our cultural identities .
we &apos;ve realized that since recently , more people have been using the tools like youtube and social networks to give their stories to tell their stories , their photos and their own stories to their own voices .
at the same time , we &apos;re going to get them , come and explore our part of the world .
so i was going to take more or less than &quot; nothing . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; maybe if i do a few apartments , they pull up there . &quot;
this was called &quot; torch house . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do that ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back to the next day .
and it was ...
my work , roughly , estimated , sometimes five , six or seven weeks ; that can &apos;t always anticipate .
and i &apos;m a bit of a turn of it , and i shaped the car .
so i broke the needle .
it &apos;s a very , very crude work , but the best things come in small plastic areas .
they expect their employees to do what they asked them to do when they did the task , they can do more .
there &apos;s this absolute concentration of being , this absolute , complete , conscious , awareness of compassion , and love that is an absolute center of compassion and love .
my body body flew into the one direction , my favorite wheel in the other .
i made all the pages that i would probably not do with them , the most important ones i would not get to you , the friends i wouldn &apos;t have to be quoted with , the friends i wouldn &apos;t be with you .
because you don &apos;t need the most sophisticated .
and if you &apos;re going to get them from back to the wind , you can just walk down and make it go down in the dirt . &quot;
20 years ago , the doctors would have turned my leg off and hoped , and there was a 15 percent chance of death .
as i was more and more of the world &apos;s great world , i was probably 14 pounds easier than i &apos;m now .
and nobody represents this modern cultural system in my eyes more than david black .
and running out , you say , is the threshold of what makes us human .
he &apos;s president of the international union for the world &apos;s most popular name that i &apos;ve ever heard of .
he was born three months early , and it was really a fantastic kind of time of him .
so once i tried to go to the piano , i became a strong amount of art .
and at the end , you were so fast that things like the &quot; flight &quot; were no problem , right ?
do you want to hear me play ?
dp : &quot; tiger rag . &quot;
i don &apos;t do that .
they &apos;re fighting their own lifestyle in this forest , in a world that &apos;s still clean , a world that &apos;s not yet charged , in a world that &apos;s not incremental .
so we know today that they &apos;re able to be able to be able to make the research for absolutely impossible than i started .
the long time that we have to have a lot of time to do that is to get the mother who evolved during this long childhood , and also the siblings , can keep the whole life for the rest of the life , and that can be to 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and also the huge camp of the forest &apos;s forest needs meat , and so the pygmies that were carried in the congo and there are so many of the years in the congo .
somebody said that yesterday .
we now have it in every state , and the problems in florida are different than the new york .
do you get me down and you turn me down here ?
there &apos;s politicians out there ?
what we want to do in the lab is so pretty the same , but with a few dozen different kinds of molecules -- so a radical reduction of complexity , but still the attempt to create something more profound .
it &apos;s actually very , very noisy . if you &apos;re in , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
now , where you &apos;re all experts for protocells , we &apos;re going to play with these protocells .
we then see the self-assembly of this body from oil that we &apos;ve seen before , and the black blobs represent this black mud -- this whole , very complex , organic black mud .
in his lab , martin martin , &quot; protocells &quot; from the &quot; protocells &quot; made , experimental blobs of chemicals that behave like living cells , and his work shows how life could be done on earth first and perhaps elsewhere .
this is a very popular one to run your tadpole at night .
what is this -- where did you know ? you &apos;ve taken it .
but if we were to do that at every fire fire , we could redefine the emergency case .
so , we &apos;re now eating the dirt that &apos;s fighting in their pretty pink lungs , and it &apos;s associated with -- in relation to -- in relation to -- in relation to -- in relation to -- that &apos;s being linked to .
the birds could jump from one to another .
you can take the news from him . you can talk to him .
but to keep this herd , it will be a huge toll of our planet .
next , we &apos;re going to isolate skin cells and multiply it into a plastic factory .
we &apos;ve been working on a thousand years of learning , and we started with products like wine , beer and yogurt .
it &apos;s true that if we &apos;re literally doing our research on the world , we see that it &apos;s almost a universal pursuit of people , a car .
let me just talk about hydrogen .
this is a huge opportunity to create energy , and produce energy .
if we can see these miniature future , it can also be different .
you had to survive .
and we certainly realized our school district to get granted and support funding and support .
because why should our students drive away from their lives ?
it became a book , then to a demo .
there was an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
here on the west coast , they have destroyed their forest .
but on this picture , you see how we started building the most expensive , which was soon a big , big office of brazil .
when i was the time , my favorite time to start , i studied the most important topic of the world &apos;s field .
if you go into the south valley department , you see the expansion of new york city , as it was , at the end of the american revolution .
the white surfaces on this map are the most remote places .
or the most prolific , the wet fins , insects and water levels .
maybe there was a more mature one there .
it &apos;s so much force to unite science and visualization , that these images are starting to see . it &apos;s like both sides of the mirror .
and we have a really dramatic level of view in our society now .
so i don &apos;t have to go closer to that .
you can do the pristine thing , which is of course .
this is a building building .
one example we all know is that the cell phones . right ?
and it &apos;s all about this question -- of course , in a very artistic and indirectly way .
but it &apos;s happening everywhere , and these tools are parts of that , that help us to create .
seriously -- clap them -- that &apos;s really great .
alex pollan : a sustainable future
you could be able to be a big problem for law , but congress don &apos;t seem to be very much more comfortable .
but if you create a lot of the amount of money , and you sell it , it &apos;s not okay .
some of the things we share , we made things that we &apos;ve found and every single option caused by the shock of the industry .
that &apos;s the simple thing .
i had a very supportive , highly expensive education in india , and that &apos;s almost broken me .
and i thought , i start a barefoot college -- college just for the poor .
a professional is somebody with a combination of competence , confidence and belief .
when i said that , they said , &quot; show us what &apos;s possible . what do you do ?
the whole electricity comes from the sun .
democracy , the way you &apos;re going to be missed your country , what you should be arrested to do if you &apos;re being arrested , what you should do if you &apos;re sick .
comes out there to tensions , cut the presence of the schools , it &apos;s coming between teachers and parents , so that the puppets can call the teachers and the parents , and say , &quot; give your hands .
you use sign sign .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , mr. president .
a computer designer .
and our main community is creating one of the largest , dynamically computing computers of the world for this kind of animal .
you see the most popular line that we have as an artist that we have as an artist for the scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , there &apos;s data of these two groups of people , data about how happy they are .
&quot; i &apos;m physically , financially , emotionally , mentally , mentally , and in almost every other way , &quot; i don &apos;t have a minute .
he was not doing the money , and of course , ray gibson had six months later , the same idea .
in this case , it &apos;s because they &apos;re used to the experiment that i &apos;m going to tell you about , prints from the images of the images .
we collected our materials , went from the room , and we waited half an hour .
i &apos;m going to show you why .
they made two pictures and they had two beautiful pieces of notes , &quot; shiny contact from them for them , and we said , &quot; what would you do ? &quot;
we take a completely new group of naive &apos;s , and say , &quot; you know , we give a laser and we can make it two different ways .
the big car , which is the great car , and the most beautiful car flies are beautiful .
voices : it &apos;s going to be in the air . oh shit .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t start . &quot;
don &apos;t forget that this tradition is not from the clouds of the clouds , but on a time , it &apos;s going to be a time before we were recording stories on the wooden street or a little bit of the way we were recording on wet water .
the way food , yeah .
the kind of the original roof , you know .
and so we took my father to his father , because i knew he would kill me if i was driving her alone . so we go into the car .
&quot; and had this guy a little uniform on a blue and a little uniform expression in the face ? &quot;
i really want to go there ? because if i didn &apos;t have a thread to get to the other -- and i don &apos;t have a metaphor for the taste of it -- -- it could be that i never come out again .
look at it ? we &apos;re a secret club with a secret machine .
she says , &quot; ma , you have to look ! &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m waiting for the little old lady , &quot; damn , &quot; damn . &quot;
she &apos;s up the car . &quot;
i really have big fear .
so what is the social result ?
where can i go and do with whom ?
and if we have , we will decide how many miles we drive , where we live , where we live and work .
smart terminal at the base of communicating and you can see exactly where your bus is just on the road , and when it comes , and you can buy your tickets in real time .
i want us to launch the wireless procedure in a way , and i urge that this network is open to open standards for everyone .
and they came in the late 1960s .
and for all of you who have a mental illness in touch , you know what a challenge can be .
i said that i wanted to tell you the most amazing , i wanted to share with you the three a &quot; of fantastic &quot; and i wanted to leave them with a close .
because they were all three years old .
and so what i love about this story is that rosey grier is just a genuine person , and that &apos;s what authenticity is about .
i ate drums with a little bit of the time . &quot;
you can sleep in clean sheets .
j it &apos;s so many that that &apos;s the problem .
i found it strange about the world as if it was a competition , it was a new wound .
it &apos;s largely a white , rich , rich , which was not held for the city .
it looks pretty simple , but it was a very high one .
people are talking about two things -- they were amazed by the destruction , but there was also a sense of the kind of the most important yorker that i found very moving .
because at the point of four platforms , the four platforms of the sun -- where one of the improved version of a computer system -- we knew that it had to be edible to be able to respond to the conditions and the original definition of ground zero .
we have the opportunity to rethink our thinking about cities .
dr : it was an honor .
and i know that children are suffering every year .
if -- god forbid -- somebody from us here , and a concussion , most of us , would be a little bit of a time of a few hours to a couple of hours of all of us in a few weeks .
you have to know about the problems that we &apos;re talking about today .
as it turns out , tom was watching a helmet for 20 dollars a good way to preserve a 100,000 , a 100,000 metric .
it &apos;s not true , but it happened tony blair during the davos , in 2005 , when his classmates , of course , were described , and he was described .
with other words , they have a common and growing complexity of visual language that happens in the sequence of the sequence .
he was told that there was no cure .
today , all countries are committed to offer patents to drugs that were at least 20 years .
it depends on the car company of the car company to become a professional and make them available for others .
in the rebellion , the same kind of stage , a computer , the people sat in the mop sun , the afternoon , very high humidity and they didn &apos;t feel themselves .
you can adapt everything to make it better for your well-being .
it provides all these services , documenting , tickets , and so little things that you &apos;re doing online , but for people who are so hard to connect the digital world .
the question was , &quot; how do you make this teacher ?
so , what he does here is what he does .
and the husband of the daughter , he was also sick through the villagers of his wife .
but the visual complexity is still very big .
well , the main test had a military designer on our studies .
well , if we feel emotions , we show them .
and you could get the impression that the unfortunate people are going to take another structural position within the network .
this is my favorite book . &quot;
they are both from carbon , and yet one of both of them has been put in a special way that are in a particular way , on the left side , and they get the soft and dark , which is soft and dark .
so to put that something into a moment , let me move to a moment .
and then older is not just going to be .
under the same circumstances , older people are set their cognitive resources , like the other of the people , like the memory and memory , more on positive information than they are on negative .
we &apos;re going to live the life .
they would like to give me , &quot; tonight , i &apos;m going to perform this kind of thing for this girl on this bar . &quot;
kid david : it &apos;s so i said , honestly , i &apos;m not sure what &apos;s going on when i dance .
they have called me brother and uncles and i &apos;ve been invited to go back to a period of five years .
spock : the second contract of fort laramie is clearly the sovereignty of the great sioux nation and the lakota of the lakota black hills .
the contract of fort laramie was asked that at least three quarter of the prison of the world &apos;s life would have to be able to use land .
they were tired of the treaties .
the most important is eight times as high as the american average .
so what is going on ?
and today , child mortality dropped by 24 percent today , six percent of the time .
you can either get it as a pill or a syringe , you have to take it every day to regulate your blood sugar .
if we do , how do we do it with people ...
but basically , it makes a lot of sense .
it &apos;s called , are you smarter than a car problem ?
bmw is a very secure car .
the problem for bmw is that car looks safe .
now you &apos;re going to think , &quot; if my life depends on it , of course , i would use it every day . &quot;
we need to connect this with a scientific method .
this is something else than actually an effective campaign campaign .
what &apos;s new .
the lights are going to be dark .
we do it for our clients .
we have the sun in the sun .
now , logic -- logical sense , look at the sense of this position in this position -- without moving the wrist .
i &apos;m going to be concerned now . now , if every time -- a different person -- not always the same answers .
so , if you &apos;re interested in this , i &apos;m going to present some of the most powerful .
here -- i have to start by looking at my cards as i &apos;m going to follow my cards during the office , and oh , we should have started to start -- no problem , no problem .
yeah ?
i think ...
lg : pardon ?
what &apos;s the map i should use ? the lady or five ?
lg : but you see your hand .
moment , wait for any card .
another color . lg : diamonds , perfect .

misha glenny : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen -- a subtle group of political detectors that brought in 2011 , that brought in 2011 .
the net connects everything and it &apos;s very soon a lot of human activity .
interestingly , anonymous uses its information information , but not for financial profits .
he explained to me how he went to tour and 2004 , and he took 10,000 dollars from the atm here , 30,000 dollars from the atm da da cards , using the little cards of the atm cards .
he was born in a stable and respect middle of family family , his obsession with play as a teenager , and he was doing it for the most poor .
and most of the exceptions , and the exception , and the script , they showed no real social skills in the world -- only in the net .
i think there &apos;s several reasons . i &apos;m not going to go to the details , but some people say .
but they &apos;re all determined by the market , and what &apos;s going on is the market , especially -- number one is the big demographic of the demographic .
we also found a lot of examples of dead big boxes that have been transformed in all sorts of social institutions , many schools , many churches , and many libraries , like this one .
and finally , i expect the streets to be applied by the mall of the mall .
it &apos;s very successful . and it helped motivate that eight of 13 regional plants have been able to get back in denver plans .

it &apos;s about a gender , which is a fundamental resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a very high , and the way it exists is really in the body , and i think there &apos;s a real meaning in our bodies , our bodies , that this separation has created a division that &apos;s also made the difference of the decision .
i want to tell you this little story about my own beginnings , because it &apos;s very strong with the happiness , and with agnes .
maybe it &apos;s on my university of south carolina , which is not much smaller than this today , and once from a future , as an independent country .
well , maybe he was too damn a damn damn man , because he was staying , even for a long time after the nazis , and even after the nazis and the most cosmopolitan and the most cosmopolitan in budapest .
and he got the same answer : &quot; let me give you the best workers you can find and if you &apos;re good enough , i &apos;m going to do it . &quot;
and also , it says , &quot; it &apos;s okay . it &apos;s all that beautiful .
&quot; ah ! &quot; dr. robicsek said , &quot; i went to the movie . &quot;
like , he &apos;s a lot of a lot of time .
and you can imagine it right .
you know what you &apos;re looking for .
but we care about the most difficult cases and order to make the other day .
so we came to these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother went to the age of the soviet union .
and if you think it &apos;s not going to be more , it &apos;s going to fail so long until you &apos;re going to do it .
what i want to do with this -- i hope to show you the dots .
and what i want to point out in the presentation is 50 percent of the u.s. is under the ocean .
it &apos;s there , because the photons can &apos;t reach the average depth of the ocean , which is the average of the earth , which is the valley on top of the valley .
and so we went along the mountain of a field next to the mountain floor , and they found the missing heat .
so i started to develop a new computer technology , with a computer company that replaced me , and i don &apos;t have to go into my vehicle .
we find the state of the conservation .
and i looked at them yesterday , she &apos;s up in seattle . ok .
but i would leave a kid without driver &apos;s license .
in some parts of the world , in south africa , education is only hard to do .
when we saw the effect of the crowd , andrew and i decided we needed to increase it to be able to offer the best education of the best education .
what was the special thing about these classes ?
the video is interrupted all the few minutes , and the students will ask a question .
so we wanted to convince some of our colleagues of the humanities that multiple choice is not so bad .
in terms of certain courses , you can ask questions which are the most common ones and how to help the students to fix these .
we even see the beginning of either using a personalized curriculum or through a personalized feedback that we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe , and what my first thought was , what was infinity , when i was a kid .
and in our society , of course , it &apos;s mostly about becoming the reality of others .
i have my doubt about the values of newton science , like , for example , it &apos;s going to be safe that you &apos;re rational in a nanotube .
so you can understand my surprise when i got to read the new york , that alan greenspan , the government &apos;s government , says , &quot; well , &apos; &quot; his rand is his mentor mentor . &quot;
i think you can do that funny , and you can &apos;t have that , which is not , you know , that &apos;s what i &apos;m not going to do . right from that reason , i don &apos;t have jokes about leahy and his charming .
i &apos;ve been doing this old times of the ted age , which i tell you .
he said , i had to pay to him more respect because it can take to 18 years to become a really good kind of good .
huh ? yeah ? what ? i can &apos;t hear you . &quot;
and i &apos;m afraid that this active person may not like us .
i thought about a grant about a lot of beauty that you &apos;ve got yesterday , and there &apos;s a gentleman &apos;s book saying that that &apos;s what he &apos;s doing , and he &apos;s saying that he can make beauty .
george w. bush : what the defense of our security costs , and what the defense of our freedom costs , we need to pay the price . &quot;
ten years ago , no astronomer would come to the world -- well , or very few astronomers -- that there are planets outside of our solar system .
many other ecosystems on earth are truly in danger .
he &apos;s constantly doing that , a experiment wrong with a particle particle , and it could produce a waste system that destroyed the world .
we need to deal with biotechnology the same assessment of development as a forest .
so , of course , we don &apos;t want to see .
what can we do in the world ?
and now the worst thing is .
we use a lot of money to make sure that we don &apos;t die at a time , but we &apos;re almost not going to be in a very , very preventable way .
we don &apos;t want to get back to the wrong foot .
i hope that will .
this is very , very important because this is the system that the echo , the alarm , from the planet , and it &apos;s now time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing insight . and we &apos;ve only been thinking about it recently .
and this is what the system tells you , a number of places in the southern hemisphere , in these circles .
everybody who comes to come from that is just to get on the database and can put information on the database that &apos;s needed to do anything .
we &apos;re on a ride to ride the wave , technological possibilities .
in a earthquake , big amounts of these new microbes that we never saw before , from the sea floor .
the u.s. designer john hunter creates a network of a network of data , sensors that make our oceans to global , interactive lab -- and a more powerful one over the world of deep causes .
so i believe that optimism is going to move forward .
so again , radical versus conservative .
the most important thing about the event . you know , you know , you want to understand everything .
our intellectual desires are complex .
you know it &apos;s true ; the cathedrals , as unexpected , will always be unexpected .
but i would rather play something completely unknown , and even with mistakes , rather than repeat the same time , so it &apos;s made by his dental exploitation .
risks of rooms never have been so versatile , as they should be in a groundbreaking city .
there &apos;s the emotions of victims .
daniel libeskind : building on very large ideas , and he calls 17 terms , which is to basically be the case of architecture -- raw , unethical , radical -- and inspiration for every bold creative quest .
it also has the lowest to all the cars of this size .
is it a really way to do it , or will there be a few more plastic points ?
em : it &apos;s just that you have to . if not , we &apos;re in big trouble .
with this capital , and it &apos;s installed solarcity , and it &apos;s installed the panels on the roof , and then the sound of the sound , or a monthly zone , is a monthly zone that &apos;s lower than the electricity supply .
we &apos;ve failed , but we &apos;ve come to this 2008 .
it &apos;s like a jet jet .
how about everything in the world , a person in the world ?
look at that .
boy , if you &apos;re eating our livestock , and a cheetahs , as he eats one of our goats , is very nervous , and then go just to him .
we were hungry .
our tradition looks like this : in every single time , there &apos;s a holy fire .
so far , we were with support of the world wildlife fund in which we have to move the very small programs to the programs with the world .
also very important -- we invest the money in a conscious field of aids and hiv .
and the more important thing -- again , a lot of a lot of the world in the world &apos;s world -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful tool .
and we hide this price behind giant winning .
dan thum and alice performs the echo of the world &apos;s life for environmental food .
and the way , the boards , oysters , oysters , the fish , the , they were the known species .
this is like a reductionist of protein .
science looks the world through the mind , in summary , things that can be measured and described , but they have a framework for knowledge and insight .
from a couple of cameras , a plan of a few cameras was a plan with 25 .
this is the natural cycle .
this would not normally do a photographer , a photograph of the way that you &apos;re doing this , right ? but sometimes it must be , to illustrate the dimensions .
here &apos;s how the glacier is moving back .
this is what we saw several cameras .
could india be the origin or a global center for innovation , just as it has become a global center for the world &apos;s center and the world &apos;s center ?

you can &apos;t be professor if you weren &apos;t a student .
the best hospitals , in the doctors for cancer treatments , and with births , and with births , heart disease , heart disease , for artificial health , to get to four o &apos;clock in the morning .
it works a little bit like -- this is a recently , a recent video of time in the morning .
i said , i know a very promising message when i see a .
every in our society comes to cancer in touch -- if not personally , then through a beloved human being , a family member , a friend , a friend .
in this space space , the genetic material is the chromosomes , within a nucleus .
we used tumor fields in the lab over 20 different types of cancer and we see this effect in all of it .
he got the most popular .
but what we can see is that in sixth months of tumor , it has been going to be a little bit of a sudden .
that &apos;s just the beginning .
this is a new settlement , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re 15 feet deep , collect rainwater from the roof , there &apos;s a little pipe , and from your courtyard .
so , water from 300 , 400 miles away , it looks like this .
somewhere is running a stream or a water stream through this scene .
it &apos;s called &quot; leroy . &quot; we have a lot of water and water pollution .
and you have to get off .
these are the beautiful stairs we &apos;ve just seen on one of the images .
and they &apos;re about 27 percent down : 600,000 fewer people per year , hiv in sub-saharan africa .
10 percent of india .
they will get the jobs in textiles , which people get from the most violent and they get them towards the north of the north and prosperity .
and the countries to the right , because you see the most expensive thing , and basically , every country with a computer system , say , less than 5,000 dollars , a more powerful one of them , we say three .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india grew up not so properly .
buy african products .
but i think a lot of a lot of the problem is that this logic -- that we should be recycled and not in bombs -- i mean , it would be a great title for thomas clooney &apos;s new book .
and then 500 people said , and they were selected four of them , and they were selected to go to the institution and to get them to the community to be more responsible .
so now , citizens with education , in 2020 , will not necessarily change anything about it , because it still is the dictators who control the agenda .
so , the internet is , does the internet get out of the worst expectations ?
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he was standing around with us younger guys .
because for me , that was in this time , and in this kind of state , the question was , &quot; you want to ? &quot; you can do it ? &quot; either sex or drugs took us .
i was paralyzed , people .
as indians , and now politicians and the other people , i &apos;m pretty much about the most cosmopolitan , is concerned about the most important thing to do , and the new superpower , which is even the new superpower .
in other words , all kinds of things we &apos;re doing about countries , regardless of countries , are like , they want to get to daylight or not .
but the lightning in our country at the time , was very slow , took it to a half an hour to a call called the book of a call .
it can &apos;t understand the translator .
this can sometimes be copied by the consequences . ok .
and these who have this money , you might like to see the money , may be surprised to see how many of the most powerful ones are in the mountain floor , which explain the most powerful .
i went home and i was doing a little bit of a little bit of fun , and i found some startling statistics .
so , the water system : a bath without water .
and now i feel like george bush .
now , this title , this phrase , comes from a critic , a early critic and this is a passage i just love , and i would like to read them to you :
and that &apos;s a good thing , because if it was so , mother nature would have a problem : how about everything in the world , we have chimpanzees to mate ?
this is the hardest part , which is not obvious , and therefore i &apos;ve been taking it for the end .
ok ? stop . that &apos;s going to take you .
i don &apos;t know why there are a lot of time of science , but no matter , they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
i actually suspect that the most important thing probably is a lot of reasons why we want to be able to recognize new things very , very quickly .
it &apos;s like this . you should see this kind of thing .
bob mckim has a different -- another version of this exercise in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned that at the time : you can get a much better mousetrap , much more creative outcomes , if all of you are going to hold the rules .
and suddenly , there was a productive conversation about design about a spontaneous object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little skeptical , i &apos;ll get back to it .
you know how it feels like it feels , all these uncertainty , as long as you leave in the corridor of the killing in one of the most skilled ways to take care of the doctors in one of the most skilled and you wonder what &apos;s going on here .
so we would all feel secure and have a good time , because we agree with the rules and agreed with it .
we do everything that leads to success , but then , if we &apos;re there , we think we &apos;ve done it . we &apos;re satisfied ourselves and just hear about what &apos;s done to us , all of that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
i was faster , but as depressed as depressed .
i learned that success is not a one-way street .
and the most simple thing is just full of hotter girls . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh my god , &quot; hopefully , for always , the last time in public .
he certainly asked that everything fit together .
it took 900 people to do it .
and the second thing is that people are obviously experiencing a real connection .
these are questions .
as you see in modern liberal democracies , society allows us to determine the state of the state , our self , to shape ourselves , but he also requires it from us .
it means we &apos;re going to meet our full potential as human beings .
so these are the layers that i wanted to share with you today -- the question : what are the intentions that are going to be used to use if you design something ?
so i said , and my colleague sebastian thrun said that there must be better ways .
and we were successful .
i &apos;m going to give you one in the fall .
he &apos;s going to get them into the right position , and they &apos;re going to join their nose and beat them .
we learned the first surprise .
there had to be a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of energy to create the amount of force and the speed that we observe and the speed of the system .
a load cell is measuring forces and that &apos;s actually a cell load cell inside .
this is the most popular -- here &apos;s the heel , and that &apos;s going to be going back and hit the load cell .
a very , very , very , very , very , very profound solution .
and nanotechnology : it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean .
i think that &apos;s one of the most beautiful classical music systems ever built .
i don &apos;t know other people &apos;s own , not even more , that they just benefit out that this is a three-dimensional space .
now you &apos;ll see that -- he &apos;s just going to get me standing .
the submarine , the last year , was this one .
and what &apos;s true is the understanding of architecture as a function of , and , please , excuse me to do the obvious example -- is not the right approach we have to choose .
basically , new york on the back of the mountain system was built , our streets about their shells .
in these eight side zones , small amounts of land , they put small amounts of food that are actually going to be .
so you went around in london , and it was overwhelmed by this smell .
finally , snow created a map of the outbreak .
and that &apos;s what happens every second week .
i made her portrait on the top of the temple temple .
and in this area of the amazon , oil was discovered .
the other side of the field is the torah of the neighborhood , where osama bin laden is supposed to be a store . that &apos;s a lot of the time .
this was one of the big big things .
this is the most popular thing . let me move and show you the hubble space of deep field .
but then you get to jupiter and that &apos;s 40 minutes away . that &apos;s a problem .
that &apos;s going to be the part that it &apos;s going to be about understanding the universe of the universe .
we only have a million galaxies .
so this is the stuff that seems to know the picture , dark matter .
when you saw this picture for the first time , you don &apos;t see much of it .
this simulation was done with 1,000 processors a month , just to make it visible .
we have a resolution with a resolution that &apos;s about this image of the earth , which is actually the complicated pattern of earth that you can actually see the complicated pattern of earth .
and in the aftermath of course , we are stressed .
47 percent .
this is crazy . we do that all the time , even in the day-to-day life .
i went to a vicious cycle . that led to many pain and problems with the joints so i could almost keep nothing .
so i asked myself , could you be creative if you &apos;re looking for intent for the limitations ?
this is not the whole thing that happened tomorrow .
the total of the total is a duty , as well as a computer designer , and there &apos;s a lot of the kind of metal of the world &apos;s brain , and there &apos;s a subtle skin of the distribution of the prevalence .
stalin &apos;s famine &apos;s famine , the first time , killed millions of people , killing millions of people in the &apos; 40s , and they were looking at the nazis who were burning , they were dressed , and many of the women were trafficked as a police service after germany .
because that &apos;s what makes the grief . &quot;
and as a psychologist , i was fascinated by the idea that what we learned in the virtual world about us , and about our identity , using our identity , use a better life in the real world .
we used to be used to a new way of being in common alone .
human relationships are the lush , chaotic and scalable .
it &apos;s a lot of it .
because in the moment , in which people are alone , even for a few seconds , they become more comfortable , fear , panic , they take care of a electronic device .
but we &apos;re in danger , because in fact , the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently , we didn &apos;t have any of the most successful people who predicted some of our undergraduate , and quite often -- i felt quite often , i felt that they had to have a kind of convincing way to the kind of convincing kind of persuasive .
maybe because my father was reading the night .
so i had to leave them with it in quiet -- but pretty , they had to be fine .
and i thought , well , i thought a pyramid of it , but i &apos;m missing the time to take it closer .
even though you lose , no fear of failing , if we &apos;ve given it all , because who can demand a human desire , when everything he &apos;s going to face .
if i should name name , i never know a answer .
did i have enough control ?
the second challenge is cells .
today , in many clinical trials , different types of stem cells are used for heart disease .
it &apos;s only last month we &apos;ve done this technology , and the creation of human life .
we can map them and turn it to 360 degrees and analyze the kidney in all their pajamas . then we can just take this information and print it by a computer tag .
i couldn &apos;t go to school . i was just dirty .
i was a kid , i said , &quot; yes , i want to do that . i want to do this surgery . i want to do this surgery .
you may have noticed that a new domain is called 1,700 .
and connected to this kind of thing , there were examples of the world -- from the choice of a president to the most cosmopolitan of wikipedia and everything in between -- the people who were able to do a lot of things .
third , more sophisticated , processed environmental problems .
because what you need is that hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want a cd , i want the music that she plays .
i &apos;m an name joseph and a member of kenya .
we need to get our women and children , we need to race . &quot;
i try to improve the infrastructure .
late , i went home with batteries and ice .
together , does anybody agree with a word ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , the master in moscow , and working in full-time care , to make this happen .
and that can be huge spending , but if the city can win a number of x volunteers for y hours , the most prolific work is the most important work to the city of the city .
they have a lot of paper tables and tables .
so these are , in the 18 minutes , that have been given me to talk to me about two and a half , and the people who are going to be in the cities .
and he was in a village called the mud village .
the buildings here have several stories .
these green things in the foreground are mangoes .
and if you &apos;re a legal model , you have political activities .
i couldn &apos;t know that i would be part of a technological revolution that would be true of this dream .
think about it . these men who didn &apos;t have the same kind of energy , i helped me to get through their engaged support , to get to law leadership .
then , in the days , it was just a little bit of a computer , but by using a computer designer , and he used a little bit of a design , and he could develop a machine that could read every single card .
but you know , i think it &apos;s very lonely to read from machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books across the border , to be different in the different english world different versions of different versions : britain , u.s. , canada , australia , and new zealand had to have all different kinds of dna types of harry potter .
the main rate . lifespan has been doubling for granted , and it &apos;s growing with a speed of five hours a day .
one last thing . do you wish to me lucky , ok ?
second , the new machine machine is a good news , because as soon as the androids take work , we don &apos;t need to do that anymore and we have to get it up and get it to the rest of us .
the social challenges of this inequality should be fibonacci .
the economic game is surprisingly clear , and surprisingly straightforward , especially on short sight .
and my biggest concern is that we create a world with a technology , with a little bit of a more mature society , and supported by an economy that is causing inequality .
in the years , i started feeling increasingly more sophisticated with this notion of god .
some of the things that have happened is that we can only believe in a god that teaches our pain .
the second thing comes out of the line , the wind and waves obey him .
so who is god , if not the big bang or the big news ?
the loving soul of the universe .
by looking at the god in the inner . by my own inwardness , i &apos;m going to go .
one of the first things i started to explore was the story of the technology technology .
we &apos;ve not found any more sophisticated people who were older than 40 years old , and the average age of these hunters and the collectors are 20 to 30 .
our bodies have used to this new diet .
so these equality of energy and matter , the einstein has shown , and also the modern science of the world &apos;s science system , the entropy and the matter of the energy and the matter of energy and the energy and energy and energy .
this is a robot that wants to stick its own plug , to get more electricity .
and what i mean is that we &apos;re looking for a new job .
a great development that started billions of years ago , moving through us and pulls itself up . and our choice is in the technology , is really in the way that we &apos;re going to be wrong with this force that &apos;s much more powerful than we do .
and they said , &quot; well , we have five classes of 30 to 40 students .
we were breaking all the down and found beautiful , and they found beautiful , and it had the look -- as we said , &quot; you know what , it &apos;s like the hull of a ship . &quot;
so we waited , we were sitting on the tables and we waited .
there are many main problems . the only problem , especially for the adults who work in the most , really didn &apos;t know anything than they had started , that there was only one toilet .
the teachers we work with -- everything is different for teachers -- they tell us what we should do .
about 170 tutors worked with them in the book , and so this worked wonderful .
and right behind -- there &apos;s usually a small chain -- right behind it , and it &apos;s just like children being taught .
there &apos;s also this kind of seed -- it &apos;s a shelf you don &apos;t see when you &apos;re in a game , but it opens up slowly .
he &apos;s a little bit of a cake . he &apos;s bringing his cousins .
he writes a email , he &apos;ll give you any question that you can imagine .
i was this girl .
80 percent of the refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s one side that thinks that peace is the end of the struggle , and there &apos;s one side that thinks that peace is the creation of schools and jobs .
she sent her children to school -- found a new home .
there &apos;s one that &apos;s called manual for full idiots , you know ?
on cape , there &apos;s a lot of roads on the cape , and we can drive all of this .
this is my baby &apos;s baby . thank you .
he basically said , &quot; i designed everything . &quot;
and in a certain sense , i always felt bad for that .
so i came up with this kind of complications .
i found that cheetos are very good at the same time .
the university is the most difficult , so the number 10 .
from everything in a strange fashion , about a window of time , which is excited about a window to the moment , in which the street was black , and the white white computer there was in the sun .
and i was reminded by karen armstrong by karen armstrong that religion really doesn &apos;t really understand , but to do with behavior .
the most sophisticated , seen , look at the same size , it doesn &apos;t look like this , but it &apos;s exactly the same size as the united states , and it &apos;s a field of the united states , which is about the same size as the state of arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the developed developed .
we can &apos;t wait to wait for the most important , the australia had to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of our entire civilization .
a new appreciation of the design that we have in the mindset of this challenge .
before i show you a few images to a preview , i want to point on this beautiful detail about the design of the design and design .
the rca is really an extraordinary school .
we &apos;ve been talking to keith &apos;s day that many scientists don &apos;t tend to show something beautiful in their talks , fear of fear , as dumb as a dumb .
so , examples of that , you can print textiles in 3d , which is very interesting .
so that makes us think more about what robots mean for us .
no . so i had to think a little sharper .
we did the same for iraq .
that was a challenge we had to ask as a physicist .
we can push it up . the forces are more , more and more , but there are more of them .
&quot; traditionally seven &quot; is a whole band .
and there are some employees in foundations called the &quot; water &quot; .
the idea of justice , which shows our lives , and gives us a sense of what &apos;s right in life , which is just in life , which is what we should do , social justice .
and as that is , it &apos;s a little bit like the most cosmopolitan .
so every week , the most popular line would come to the world . &quot; god , you &apos;ve answered me . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , infection , an infection or a surgery .
the muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- call the way that .
we treat them with a drug of drugs -- -- the ones , frankly , in this kind of pain , not very effective .
now you get a sense of this , as slowly as you &apos;re talking about , you know , talking about how much rock we &apos;re talking about .
it was 1908 . it &apos;s not doing anything . so i can live .
i don &apos;t know if you can see it from the back line from all the back of the back . these are just stars .
in 2005 , nasa started a probe called deep impact , which is a -- with a part of the inside of a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , i said , engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and we can have a more of the time and choose to have a change and we can change our future .
i &apos;ve led to this time , the only independent , to be exactly the only electronic medium of the country .
and i thought that the survival of survival and a great company would be if the spyfish would only be gone , which was really out of the way .
and at the end of the meeting , he says , look , it won &apos;t work , you will never see your money again , but my foundation will be 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test the idea .
and we said , this is okay , we make it all , and we do it , and you get your business plan , what you actually did .
you see , we started in eastern and central central school , and we went to russia .
after a while , we opened a little bit of a computer .
and we &apos;ve developed the idea , to spend bonds on the free press .
and in this way , you &apos;ve organized the funding , so it doesn &apos;t exist , no rich , you have to find yourself .
so why does that work ? that &apos;s the question .
well , some of the things call a theory of everything .
just example , this is the subject of newton , the law of gravity , which works like one of the square of the square , the one of the most common objects of the ocean .
the more symmetry you have , the better you make the simplicity and elegance of the theory .
one thing that he thought was most of us today than we were given , but it wasn &apos;t of course .
it doesn &apos;t matter the meaning of knowing that they &apos;re going to follow the laws , and accidents .
but he read in every free moment he had , books .
from that ambition , he returned to the prison .
but when he was just to put his signature under the world &apos;s office , his hand was deaf , and he was shaking because he had a thousand hands in the morning .
not very surprising -- it was only three women under the 16 house in the white house .
but i have to say , the older i became , the more i understand what was an incredible privilege to have with this aging lion from a man as many hours .
and like lincoln told the story , all after the u.k. , after the u.k.
i asked my father , &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
what the reason is that i &apos;m always grateful for this strange love to the story that allows me to spend a life in backwards .
he had the temple , and he was appointed .
this is the most important thing that is the evidence that the jews for exile , the jews after exile , after all years , were going to be the whole years that they were sitting in babylon and cried at the rivers that they were going to go home .
all of these are being respected by cyrus .
the cylinder cylinder is from the priests of the great bang of babylon , marduk , writing .
you all know what happened .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of living jews came to tehran .
some of you know more about the living conditions , but you &apos;re still thinking that you &apos;re a kind of a bad bonus .
the new ones cried in the first few hours , but their needs were not satisfied and they were not allowed to go to work , and they were not going to be able to go to the air , and they &apos;re going to start to start with the air , like all other .
a study shows that support support 10 percent of a child support cost , as a half percent of a million percent costs .
and that fascinated me , because i had almost spent my entire life on a camera .
you know quite quickly what you have to do to find an answer .
it was people who are people who are -- most of them and family .
we heard every single one .
but of course he never came . the explanation never happened .
and after many , many meetings , i was thrilled that this man , 54 , really , really , is one of my heroes and mentors , it managed to get to the boat .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones who believed to peace and to his opportunities , etc . , etc . -- and they were going to be really .
we connect with the world &apos;s brain -- i &apos;ve met a little bit of a computer , and i said , &quot; london 2012 , it &apos;s about truce .
it &apos;s about your business , to your business .
the biggest brains of the world should also be cognitively the most cognitively .
i went to the world &apos;s office , but i could never find them .
there &apos;s just a big primate brain .
and amazingly , it fits exactly what our ancestors invented a million years ago than they discovered cooking .
right , the basic approaches to the design of conversations that i led .
and i think i &apos;m just at the beginning .
but once the struggle is the fight , the physical rehabilitation was exposed to .
behind him was a kid , his son , red in the face of effort , his father .
but mahmoud and his son were there .
i was talking to my boss at the night headquarters , and i told them -- i was going to tell you , &quot; look , we &apos;re going to start with a few hours every day , just for some of the constellations . &quot;
two groups of the computer engineers started fighting .
so i asked him , &quot; what &apos;s it going to happen ? &quot;
&quot; yes , we need to increase the production of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
and it &apos;s not just in the orthopedic center , but in the houses of people .
and you should see me during a computer scanner .
and this hospital could have been able to have a lot of time .
why ? because the way that i took it was no way .
but i learned something more profound than that , which is that the leaders -- the manager of the economy ghana -- were very bad decisions that were taking our economy short before the collapse .
because i knew that the state of the african continent for my children would be important to my children .
i &apos;m trying to get the experience that i had in swarthmore , to africa .
is my time ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment from a great society within a generation .
you &apos;ll notice that he &apos;s very similar to the baby &apos;s yellow ball -- the sun we draw as children .
in fact , that &apos;s something that half of you , more than half , will be not familiar .
32 pills of the shrine is the womb .
i think it &apos;s . &quot;
and that &apos;s the messages you &apos;re communicating to ?
because , in the end , the funders love it , and it &apos;s constantly bringing them into tv .
a professional computer group , who talks with dead , you don &apos;t get me ?
what is homeopathy ?
we &apos;d like to have a number of people who went to see people like they were doing , and they would do a lot of health care , and they would do something .
thank you .
so the entire hospital is often about a generator .
there &apos;s a better thing to do . &quot;
but that &apos;s how the user can control whether there &apos;s no electricity or not , because they can control the most expensive on the ground , and give them a lot of oxygen .
but we want to be sure that this is the most effective and poor device that we can provide hospitals .
the different types of writing in africa , the first one was a lot of the time that the script shows the secret , which is the secret of a secret society in the world &apos;s brain .
anyway , until 1998 , when a computer writer named john coleman discovered the in the morning of the village in the village , in the inner-city of the village , in the inner-city of the year , in the inner-city a.d. , in the 1940s , centuries ago , centuries ago , centuries ago .
almost a fifth of the greenhouse gases comes from livestock -- that &apos;s more than traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and the animals in the line of the line , and the animals on the line of tools , is not just that easy .
and the one in french was a really in french .
a picture of fish would be better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t quite bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
some of us would be that maybe it wasn &apos;t so bad at all .
and i asked a question about a year , &quot; why am i , although i know what i know , no vegetarian ? &quot;
the weekend is the choice .
you can make a picture with an iphone and get all the names , even though it &apos;s sometimes a mistake .
it stays distracted . he &apos;s going to win the race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would be able to figure out , it &apos;s more interest to try to figure out , if the operations are so high , but it &apos;s a very , very noisy area .
or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a big artwork .
the human nature has to change .
but part of the reason -- and that &apos;s why we have an ethical level in the judgment -- is that they &apos;re also intrinsic .
it could be more complicated in people , but maybe not very .
jh : is it quiet to play with these forces ?
and so i knew that i need something to remote remote .
so there &apos;s a lot of time , because there &apos;s a lot of the material that &apos;s the fluid behavior .
and so i think that you can be more involved .
this is a great assistant in the studio .
we take the pizza , our first pizza , and excel the individual slices while the messenger is in the hallway and we &apos;re going to get us out .
i was sure 20 , before i first went to art .
i thought , okay , you &apos;ve got some criteria like you want to pick the works .
it &apos;s not photoshop .
they &apos;re interested in creating a novel alternative , alternatives , and they needed money to make some interesting fundraising projects .
this project is called &quot; the &quot; road &quot; .
and so we went to the grave and i did this , it was hilarious -- the attention we got .
and she describes how the most popular -- everything you say is because of the most playful fruit .
he &apos;s a giant scholar of the local world , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it &apos;s linked to origami . so , you know .
people used mathematical principles to understand the underlying principles of understanding .
or they &apos;re pushing it on the top and they do 50 stars on a flag with 13 stripes .
how would you make a flap ?
we found these rules with which you put circles on them , you covered the color lines with lines , the extra rules obey . that makes the crease patterns .
you can do a lot of things .
but , if you want to make it bigger , you could need something origami .
and that doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re going to space or whether you &apos;re going to be in a body .
i grew up in a state of washington in the state of washington with too much time .
we only have three minutes . but we &apos;re talking about hours of hours .
and so i want to talk about that , because if we don &apos;t recognize it , this transformation will be very painful .
and in a moment , i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;re going to see in the graph -- it starts in 1973 , just before the women start to beat the job , and it goes on to the day today .
you gave instructions from top .
because i write about all this a book , i still , and i don &apos;t have any answer .
and that was very daunting for you .
there &apos;s no way that we have this information completely processed , and they come back to us in the form of culture , in this weird and overblown way where you can see that there are conflicting changes .
there &apos;s no man or a woman who &apos;s in the middle and it &apos;s the wires to tick up .
so , with the personal income , the personal income was given to a scale that was kept to adopt inflation , in this time more than doubled , which has almost tripled .
and to hear me , and to understand what i say , you have to have about 60 bits per second .
and it &apos;s happening , so in the last book of me called &quot; good business , &quot; i interviewed some ceo who were very successful from her environment as very successfully and also described very ethical , with great social sense .
control is also a safe thing , because you feel in your mind , but not very scary .
&quot; where are you born , grew up and went to school ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they had their own meaning for what home is , they had their significance for community , and even for hostility , which was been taken from birth to birth . they didn &apos;t really have the opportunity to go beyond .
more and more people are in the future or the present , as in the past .
i went down into the room where i should sleep .
so , the question is , where is it to go home ?
there was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized countries and the two billion in the developing world .
but that &apos;s the world that we have today . no gap .
and let me show you why , by looking at the most ancient , digital technology .
the survival of the children is the new green .
and again , they were better than we said , &quot; their brits and your mortality rate are shocking . &quot;
but if you have people , you don &apos;t change the high number of heart disease .
and i immediately started working with the work of the work , and they were growing , and then i worked with a little bit of work -- mice , that couldn &apos;t produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my mother-in-law , and of course i don &apos;t know how old she is .
you could be in the same way as well as the equator .
certainly many progress , many of the most sophisticated lives .
this is actually a real photography , in time time , which shows that the limb is going to defeat in less days .
and here on the right , you see what &apos;s happening six months later , which is technically appropriate .
a blood vessel is made of two different cell types .
then we put it back into this oven-like device .
much more complex organs . with distance the most complex solid organs are the high ones , with lots of water vessels , like heart , liver and kidneys .
this is still in the middle of the brain .
we prefer cells that are not going to reject and make tumors .
we only need five seconds .
for every problem out there , anybody would have an idea .
so , i &apos;m just saying something in panic -- unlike all the fragility and sugar , which i had -- but this is really a really scary thing for a entrepreneur .
that doesn &apos;t mean you have to visit a more of a design problem .
i went to door door , and i sold the car bomb license .
it &apos;s like a recession . so , there &apos;s a recession .
and you would do this chairs .
this is unacceptable . you have to find a way to get on the money faster .
i sold a lot of meditators .
they don &apos;t get a regular income , but they have the opportunity to find more tasks and they learn to learn the ability to find the ability to find more possibilities .
if you go to a restaurant and you &apos;re doing bad , you &apos;ll show you how bad practice looks like this .
these young , thai initiatives .
the development of today &apos;s students is all of the interests of being on a board .
the most important thing of the computer system or a nuclear scientist is pulling out the most of our students .
the values of the past are also characterized . that &apos;s what we do .
but it &apos;s an politics of principles , not the most important .
they have a mind . and they have other people .
what we should do when we think about conservatives -- except this case of the 1980s -- what it &apos;s going to be like is , you go to church .
yeah , i know you don &apos;t really believe me .
and that doesn &apos;t just lead to another outcome , it has the potential to change how we deal with each other .
completely different .
in fact , this is not a rights organization , but clearly -- let me end this -- creative commons , author , a simple way , to give authors to the freedoms that they want to leave them with .
john mccain .
and i wonder how often this happens .
he told me that he was the most cosmopolitan and then he said , &quot; there &apos;s a snake in the next room , and we &apos;re going to be there now . &quot;
so , for today , i had the idea that i &apos;m going to run them through this process and show them how this journey looks like this .
and the hospital and general electric were also happy .
i was surviving , just to get us right .
i &apos;m always asked by people , &quot; is it really possible to use these microbial ecosystems to our benefit ? &quot;
another way of how microbes can spread out is through the people . architects in the way they put together spaces like this , and they like to engage in the human interaction , and to promote the human interaction , for example , and the offices of ideas .
imagine a design that takes the microbes to take account , for example , in the airplane or on a phone .
and nobody knew about it .
my company , the company , built a system called the leader of the apple macintosh .
in 1992 , his essay was rejected by the u.s.
and greenpeace wanted to do this , and a method that you wanted to do with it , was one of those humpback whales , a computer of mine , a computer of mine .
on 78 percent of the voices . to give you a sense of the master victory : &quot; duh 2 in the world &apos;s office , &quot; just three percent .
and the last message i want to share with you is : you can be online , you know , very successful .
i think i don &apos;t need to explain what a big privilege it is to be , today .
this is the school that was built with the community .
something that we have in gando are the main ones .
just like that .
good morning . magic is a brilliant way to get the most important way to get the most important to do what science is going to do tomorrow .
there &apos;s the color red and the color black , they &apos;re going to be the constant shift for the day .
voice : why not ? this is a very good piece .
this is an illusion .
so this is china , a civilization-state , and not so much a nation-state .
but you can &apos;t lead a country like china , a civilization-state , on the ground of a civilization .
and the reason is , first , the state in china gets a very special -- a very special way to enjoy the representative , the embodiment and the chief of the chinese civilization , the most sacred and the chief of the chinese civilization .
he was in &apos; 60s , in 1996 , with the beijing beijing and shanghai .
we &apos;ve seen this in terms of the easy -- the position of the position of the state of the state , or the g8 .
he goes on a road on the metropolitan floor , and the cars drive underneath .
red = top blue bass = green blue bass &apos;s little mermaid &apos;s top top of the sun &apos;s top line , which is the most powerful thing .
and the first song was on english , the second one was on chinese .
she was her song .
i made it , writing my name everywhere , used the city as a canvas .
i mean , these were the faces of my friends .
they all accepted that their image would come to the next side of each other .
&quot; you mean , you &apos;re a little bit of a face face -- that &apos;s a face , right ?
and most places i went to go to , i decided to go because i had heard about them in the media .
i took more photos and we launched the project .
are you an ngo ? are you from the media ? &quot;
so the roofs were held , a woman , a woman , &quot; now i can see god . &quot;
because this is a big part of it . there are layers behind everyone .
but they basically took me a promise .
or , &quot; how can we help . &quot;
if i think about the mesh and what they &apos;re driving , why it &apos;s going to happen now , i think there are some factors that i want to give you as a master problem .
they &apos;ve made a trend .
zipcar started a decade earlier , in 2000 .
it challenges to participation . cities have been able to welcome the way to welcome the conditions .
it &apos;s very cheap , and it &apos;s very &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last 40 years were extraordinary times .
and miniaturization .
that would produce a tremendous deal of innovation .
it &apos;s vital that at ted , ideas , ideas , about the ones we think about , are very much a very glorious century , and not one of the most successful and not of the most of the time and the most of the most violent and not a drug of food .
my remaining family are boring academics that are struggling to collect , to collect the oil of the city for our own .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet the prime minister . &quot;
i thought he was crazy , but something was really left .
i was sitting here , like you , in the audience .
this is another picture .
since netra , my career has been taking a lot of success .
i started exploring the most popular of human psyche .
this time i said , let &apos;s try something else .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much better . einstein is very honored to be here at ted 2006 in the ted world , in fact , and it &apos;s very excited .
it would be very dangerous if you fall down .
sw : no , i don &apos;t have a problem . you have the problem , you remember ?

goliath is light prey . it doesn &apos;t have any chance .
so goliath is more likely than a more sophisticated way to the time , and usually there &apos;s an explanation for that when someone is so far outside of the norm .
and i think that there &apos;s a very important lesson for all of us .
and it turns out we &apos;re covered by a plastic company , and these microbes are mostly doing well , instead of killing us .
they all have the microbes , and then they put the little little estate in the receiver .
most pills , or the most expensive , you can eat , one or two , maybe five species , and the human community has thousands of species of species .
we need a more sophisticated tool for the microbes that live in and on people , so we can understand what they &apos;re doing .
very many people think about the internet , and it &apos;s really focused on english , but it &apos;s really global . we &apos;re in many , many languages .
when she looked at it a ridiculous change on the side of me , they thought they would probably be that all of this would be in the trash .

in the jungle , in guatemala , a temple is a temple .
not a well-known indian indian indian in the year of a village told a missionary in a year , and here it is .

we &apos;re turning ourselves to each other , and we &apos;re going to keep our appearance &quot; wiring . &quot;
tools like sunrise , knives , brit , hispanic or more , i had a towel that i had in a towel .
i had looked at it for a long time , and i had never looked at my close .
in some of the most skilled , they put tools , about sponges to the most cosmopolitan .
so dolphins can get a lot of time and off from the distance .
look at how they were to synchronize with their partner and the other .
but we found that free dolphins are not just on a boat on a keyboard .
this dolphin , we called &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; because she &apos;s devastated by about 12 .

and wondering what , as you might , what you saw , to explain what you were looking at was the invisible powers .
because this event was the scientific revolution since the knowledge of our knowledge , and how we can adapt to our needs , to be able to grow down in the way .

your search is based on immortality ; our name on the bible . &quot;
there &apos;s something like a more unfair story .

this is a bear where i sat on the rocks for a while .
this is a piece of a little bit of ice ice , it &apos;s 12 years old .
i &apos;m going to show you images today from the ted community , and the polar bears and polar seals and leopard seals , but this picture here is more than any other thing i &apos;ve ever done .
people were saying , &quot; we knew they &apos;re malignant . we knew it . &quot;
and this seal took the penguin in the head and he shook him up and forth .

joe , we &apos;re doing this so long until you &apos;re shrinking it .
funny , yes , we have a little man , a little bit of a day , a computer company , the whole day there .
as i said , it shapes her reality .
first of all , we worked together , and ushahidi and develop it .
a call in the united states , in canada or china , five main , or the u.s. dollars , is $ 5 .
it &apos;s built up , so you can also put a peer tag together , and it &apos;s also a remote place in remote places .
and the building was higher , and the building is better , and the technology is getting better , so that the mechanical systems were enormous . they need large amounts of energy .
imagine two americans traveling together by italy .
please raise all of that as liberal as liberal .
the best definition of the &quot; i know &quot; -- she explains so much -- comes from the street by gary george archive .
he makes us very , very old boxes .

she went upward and continued to go on .
and they say , &quot; hold your laws away from my body . &quot;
and we have the signs of the right to the right , the liberals , the liberals -- and both work together .
and so the answer is , i think , to use this passion to the truth and try to turn them into a better future for all of us .
but if you react to the other people in the environment , they &apos;re a lot of other people who are innocent , but also hurt -- the military doesn &apos;t like to talk about damage .
we look at something else , &quot; and apparently , it doesn &apos;t seem to be really very noisy .
is there anybody a commandment , like often , when you think about how often the police was introduced to the way that the police spray up in queensland then ?
there was only a few people shot at this incident .

we started organizing makers in our &quot; maker fair . &quot;
so , more attractive billy bass , or something like this .

this is &quot; the &quot; test . &quot;
and we need to bring that into the schools , or in the communities , many , many kinds of -- the ability to build the world around us and to form .
there &apos;s glamour of physics .
and in fact , we see these miniature photos of stars that all the time -- you call them a little bit of it .
they don &apos;t look at it from a way , but you have to be mentally mentally imagined .
vertically , which is an emerging winds , are glamorous .
but it &apos;s going to be an illusion that if you buy this lamp , you &apos;re going to be in a world without wires .
the perfect thing is that the perfect chain is consistent with the perfect chain , with the perfect body .
because glamour can be very supportive and pathetic .
but i also knew how hard she worked for the whole week .
i did this a few of the strangers .
i heard about women who were being accused of their beds , or throve in their own , like dead left left in their kitchens , burned in their kitchens .

and second , is it possible , or is it even obscure , getting slower ?
you want to go back to a slow rhythm .
and norway , sweden , denmark and finland are under the six of the u.s. companies of the world and work hours of the average american , who would cry in front of the average americans .
but the new idea that &apos;s revolutionary idea is that it &apos;s like &quot; good slow . &quot;
i realized the main story of a computer problem on my favorite , and it was a little bit of me , because they were so slow , and i wanted to be quickly done .
and so everything started taking his beginning , and they said , &quot; you can &apos;t build everything on an island ; you have to stay on the bank , because we don &apos;t want to bend from the community . &quot;
i worked on this , and i didn &apos;t work with it because i felt that people who came out of the historical museum , with information , are already filled with information , and if they &apos;re still a museum with information , they wouldn &apos;t process that anymore .
when i flew back home , the most popular was planned .
but you see the uniqueness of the environment .

this made me curious . i hear this , because i want to ask you , and here &apos;s a lot of people who have been spending -- of course , people who spent their childhood here .
so , next i was going to the phone .
october , november , december . this is not the time of the northeast monsoon .
okay , they &apos;re going to go down to the time of the seasonal rains , while the average ice .
last week , it &apos;s got a lot of time . the most popular , and now it &apos;s going to start there .
a pretty incredible climate problem .
incredible . this is the most amazing way of a computer of a computer , a pretty incredible journey .
i made this out of my life .
and everybody thought i was good . but on the new terrain , i was terrible . people said , &quot; oh , he &apos;s -- oh , what about the formal ? &quot;
and at night , i looked at them , and i asked them , &quot; how am i going to do that ? &quot;
next -- oh , pay attention . these guys are the community .
so i was pretty successful . and if you &apos;ve done all that , what is it going to drive , and i &apos;ve told you about the one that &apos;s still going to drive ? i &apos;ve been telling you what &apos;s going on ?

i &apos;ve described the opposite of a success story .
a walk in a city or a city show , this diversity of human species on amazing ways .

it was a africans where the world &apos;s diversity is based on the world .
the sahara was much bigger than today .
people who are living on the killing of animals that they were killing in the water , they moved to north and followed about 45,000 years ago , and they were about 45,000 years ago in the grasslands of the sahara in a rare east .
the main genome project , the most human genome system on mars .
we know deep in our hearts that the universe is not moving from mush to complexity .
so go there .
what you see here , the blue areas are cooler , cooler than the red areas .
it works over smaller distances than gravity is what explains why they and i are smaller than the stars and planets .
you &apos;re going to be familiar with the double helix of dna .
let me explain why .
in the last 200 years , something else happened .
you might ask yourself , &quot; what &apos;s talking about ? &quot;
we &apos;re not so good at the age of insurance .
and then you have to decide how you invest in your 52 choices , and you never heard of a kind of a computer .
at least a wonderful study predicted that .
but if you get the driver &apos;s license , you cross the box , if you don &apos;t want to donate the organs .
the other group gets two apples , one is taken .
save more tomorrow just .
that &apos;s just one example .
it &apos;s a song about a so-called called a creature , which is a creature that mimics a creature that mimics a creature .
hello , who is there , please ?
thank you .
and the knowledge has too much influence on the experience of life .
i &apos;m trying to get time to go to the world .
so what did i do ?
we invent stories to explain our existence .
so what did they do ? they sent their walter raleigh to separate their human part of their divine part of their divine part of their divine part .
you can &apos;t even do a kid ?
elizabeth : get out ! get out ! get out ! get out !
i went to visit a friend of mine and he &apos;d wait to wait in his apartment in his apartment in a hospital in the 1900s , a really rich area in mumbai .

if you can &apos;t be sustainable , if you can get all products , how can we achieve this ?
coke has to work with pepsi .
these are nine of them .
at the end , we had , i think , 60 percent of the world &apos;s production in the table and 25 percent of the internet &apos;s table .
that &apos;s not irrelevant .
but they don &apos;t just buy the juice ; they also buy the carbon in the trees to overcome the water of the water , to overcome the product of the product to europe .
so , the communication is interrupted between brain and spinal cord , and this leads to a full and sustained paralysis of the leg .
after a few years , it &apos;s been us able to make a low-cost diagnostic that &apos;s a very high the nervous system of the spinal cord in a sleeping bear .
we &apos;ve worked hard for 10 years to get this goal .
after a few weeks , we put a programmable pump to inject a individual cell structure directly into the spinal cord .
and i was a kid of the scene of the scene .
he talked about the world , as she is , and the world , as she should be .

the last day , the woman who was there , he was doing everything , and we talked about each other , and suddenly she said to me , &quot; would you sing me something ? &quot;
for this , this is a double one of the voice , because it &apos;s mysterious -- as you can see -- it &apos;s completely spontaneous , and it &apos;s originally .
they didn &apos;t have anything .
so the internet needs the internet and instructions .
one of the most popular websites of the world that &apos;s been run by the most powerful company of the world , and there was nothing that could have done youtube or google against it .
and today wikipedia is so ubiquitous that you can actually find them on the cards of restaurants in china .
and that has made wikipedia understood .
this is a blog that &apos;s devoted to a blog that &apos;s devoted to a second .
why ? there &apos;s a solar system at a time .
the world was not born in the 90s .
and we see that the impact of the ecosystem in some countries are very , very strong .
all of this costs money .
and it was done much to get students with a foreign or social , and they have the same opportunity to give them the same opportunity .
how are schools being presented in the media and teachers in the media ?
in bureaucratic systems , teachers are left by the teachers alone and they have a lot of security .
some people say that the change of the brain &apos;s change is just a bit like a safety of a computer .
but if you look at the issue of this perspective , you see what happened in the last 60 years .
and i went around the morning about 15 miles to get the computer .
so this was obviously a kind of a design device .
we could also do that with phones .
so a business is going to be .
&quot; the government must provide economic services services . &quot;
it was once , long time , when i was 24 years old , i was at st. john &apos;s medical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical medical office .

now we &apos;re in the 1930s , and you see that japan is going through a time of war , living living life expectancy .
and they decided to invest not only in health and education , but they also began to grow the economy .
washington , d.c. , went outside .
not the bubble , not my bubbles , but the financial bubble .
will you really accept the entire world &apos;s own global economy , and the power transition of where it was in the last 50 to 100 years , was back to asia ?
the rest of the diagram is a very mysterious substance called dark energy .
but that explains the presence of all the mass .
and now , pay attention to the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe -- a three-dimensional space .
again , this is a kind of a kind of conceptual model of what &apos;s going on during the field of the war .
they move away from each other because the space is bigger .
by looking at things like clusters of objects -- their favorite , as many of them are as function of time -- we can bring in experience , which is kind of dark matter and dark energy in order to form structures .
the big questions in physics .
sleepy you banjo boys : new jersey -- new jersey ?

it &apos;s a disease that kills a lot of adults in africa , and also many children .
in uganda , we see the prevalence .
it &apos;s going to end up quite similar to the same .
but openness and connection has a price when we think about diseases . that should not be surprise .
coffee is organic &apos;s organic culture .
emily ornish &apos;s still studied aids in africa in africa , and comes from an amazing conclusion , and comes to a surprising conclusion : all of our knowledge about the spread of hiv on the continent .
but i was fascinated by watching this kind of kind of , i saw this kind of kind of a kind of animal &apos;s exclusive .
he was called &quot; the &quot; killer monologues &quot; , called , because he was on front of the front , but every time he drove in a tunnel , he was making a joint on the tunnel , and the tunnel was always a kind of a kind of a kind of a plastic designer .

it never happens in india , because it was once again and never again .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s say , &quot; well , let &apos;s pray . &quot;
this was a very , very 1,000 commission for over 1,000 prisoners in this prison .
second , it &apos;s about the most important movement in india .
so let me tell you about a project that we did a few years later , a kind of captcha of captcha .
and basically , you &apos;re doing it by starting with an old book .
the number of pages that the recaptcha is using is actually that the number of words we digitize a day is very , very big .
some are more fun .
now , the web is divided into several languages .
then my favorite issue comes from the question .
there &apos;s a way to beat two flies with a little one .
but what &apos;s perhaps more surprising is that we get the translations of the world &apos;s most important , even if you &apos;re just a beginner who &apos;s just the translations that we &apos;re getting , as the professional of professional music , and that &apos;s very surprising .
there are people who are struggling for people to do it , they don &apos;t have to pay with money , they pay with their time .

i played the violent african , the african terrorists .
well , from the first time , no more explicit ever had a failed effect -- so no one had ever reached the absolute majority -- so the elections in a second round of three weeks later .
now , here &apos;s an interesting comparison .
so i moved to la jolla , and i &apos;ve learned surfing .
people in the 17th century didn &apos;t really know how we think that this stuff is a bunch of different molecules , and that we are looking at it from a certain reason and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to breathe .
and so , charles , i &apos;m going to put money on you , give you a building , and you can make you go there , but you don &apos;t talk about religion .
reality is what you can see .
i thought everybody with a little minds would do this .
just to see what would happen if you mix the two .
so i have something that &apos;s not personally .
if you want to be rich today , entrepreneurs will .
they say , if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , it doesn &apos;t increase -- it &apos;s not going to be on all . we &apos;re very carefully at the very very very carefully time of satellites , and it doesn &apos;t go up .
regina kary mullis : the basis of modern science : the experiment . he tells stories from the 17th century and his own family , and the curiosity , inspiration and care of good science in all their shapes .

&quot; naked city &quot; is a nickname for new york and &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; and &quot; the &quot; naked city &quot; and the kind of state of the brain &apos;s mind .
i love traveling , and berlin has become one of my favorite classes .
and the whole time i &apos;ve been looking at a rat for some of these places , until recently i was in the london channels .
the first question is , and maybe they write them on , either on a sheet of paper , physically , or on a virtual slate in their head , and , for audiences , you can try that .
and we then break out , &quot; we are the best scientific school in the world , &quot; because of our british hubris .
except , you guys -- you guys -- you know , you have the surge , you thought , &quot; hmm , what happens during the night ? &quot;
and one of the most difficult problems , if people have a sense of how all of it works , it &apos;s pretty difficult to change this .
and as an expert for inorganic chemistry , i have friends and colleagues that are different between the organic , living world and the inorganic world .
and you can see , he &apos;s torn up , he &apos;s growing , growing in a way .
we even have amazing life that we can manipulate .
and darwin himself was asking in a letter to a colleague that was probably done in a very warm pond , and perhaps in scotland , maybe in scotland , maybe in scotland , maybe somewhere else , maybe somewhere else .
what is life ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can connect them and literally create thousands and thousands of thousands of really large molecules , in the same size like dna and proteins , but it &apos;s not carbon in a view .
we want to put them in the environment and we want them to get their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can create inorganic biology and can make matter , then that will define life .
but there &apos;s another reason why i like this development system : every single one is measuring .
and these are high professionals , interviewer , who sit down a woman who was sitting on a woman and ask her to ask her to her favorite day .
i was really sitting on friday on my computer , and i could see how the mortality rate of this morning was from scytodes on 84 .
as you know , these economists love money , they want more and more and more .
as you can see , it doesn &apos;t make sense of an average to compute an average that wasn &apos;t and that very fast progress .
but you don &apos;t talk about that much .
in which there were high , or very high , child mortality and families , also very large , six to eight .
here &apos;s also a container .
whatever remains more value for money .
yeah , i went barefoot , until i was 12 .
and he told them , &quot; imagine the most important thing in question .
the whole time was a border of disruptive .
and the way to get forward , after my opinion , is going to make a difference , not just a few , but for everyone .
... above the knee , yes , that would be difficult ...
the most important -- it took about 10 years and 700 million dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth is enough to satisfy everybody needs to satisfy everybody , but not everybody &apos;s greed .

i went to high school .
when i was on the council of scientific industry research -- 40 laboratories -- when two main people don &apos;t even speak , i built teams .

it &apos;s about to be perfect and to do something old in the 21st century .
it &apos;s still very hot , but not more of charity .
but there &apos;s no way that this reactor is under high pressure , and it &apos;s not that high , meaning that the most important thing is not to leave the reactor .
i &apos;m convinced that the reactor i designed here is a innovative source of energy that is going to be great scientific projects with electricity , and i &apos;m really ready to do this .
we &apos;re moving to a study of learning that &apos;s the experience that &apos;s the actual product .
there &apos;s a manufacturer of the world &apos;s business that &apos;s going to be in the forest .
at the end of a long fee , the good thing he &apos;s doing is he &apos;s telling his son , he says , &quot; especially , it &apos;s a lot of time to do yourself .
you don &apos;t normally go in los angeles , but there &apos;s a place where you can walk a lot of time out in this city .
then they get felt wrong when they were going to be able to use these properties , using these properties that they don &apos;t have .
when i was small , i was very an introvert and stayed for me .
then it was just about starting to start and then start building it up to the end .
so i made it out concrete , because it doesn &apos;t matter .
this was this tool .
and for me , that &apos;s the most important thing for me , because since i was a kid , i wanted to convey my passion and love .
25 days : the sediment evolves 32 days : poor and hands are going to evolve 36 days : the primitive spine starts to form this weeks , in the world , the fetus is growing up .
the complexity , this in a single system , is again beyond every understanding or any of the mathematics today .
because apparently , there &apos;s no way of this unstable carbon system in the atmosphere of sun-like stars .
so what can you do with these spectra ?
and recently , a colleague of berkeley sent me a colleague , a fellow , a very interesting spectrum , and he said , &quot; can you look at this ? &quot;
there are two ways -- over the world &apos;s business and the stars -- on the matter of matter and chemical elements in the universe and will be manipulating .
because can you imagine that everything is going to be all of the time ?
now imagine a object , an incredible object , or something that we can &apos;t explain and we &apos;re just saying , &quot; we &apos;re going . physics is not going to work . &quot;
and if we see it , and oxygen , i think we have the perfect e.t. .
i just said , &quot; really ? &quot; and he said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what i can tell you about is universal ; we all have them .
i &apos;m slightly addicted to the street , but that &apos;s another talk .
this led to a little breakdown -- -- that &apos;s actually rather like this .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is , no one &apos;s , no , no , no , no . &quot;
what are you feeling vulnerable ? &quot;
i &apos;m right , you don &apos;t have a right . hang on .
we do that as if that we do , no impact on other people .
people are going to twitter their meals in twitter , the flyovers of their children on the iphone .
so if we think about it , to make a systematic improvements , we think about making the systematic improvements , we also think about how to be useful to our own , and we know .
and today i want to talk about one of the things that we decided to do at the time , because we wanted to find a new access to health care .
so steven shares his story . but he &apos;s not alone .
here &apos;s why people pray .
i also love this kind of thing , and i also love this kind of thing , the only one online , which was online and available .
and here we have a paper .
you don &apos;t have any data , you don &apos;t have any data , that &apos;s not going to work for scientific methods .
this is the curve of the brain &apos;s head .
but my brother didn &apos;t go to the end of him .
if we went from here to the ted system , we would get to something that 300 meters high , 120 miles long , and that &apos;s a hundred rupees , and that &apos;s two rogue infections .
to change the state , you only need two volts of a laser .
we said , &quot; can you build this ? &quot;
we can do that better .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that comes from what &apos;s called the so-called ice effect .
so , the skills are ideals of the world &apos;s networks of complex systems .
and it also has impact on systems .
so we could put a nuclear nut in a brain .
we see the emergence of the world , and we see the programs that are grounded in understanding our most connected world from the point of complexity .
and the more important capacity with a brain capacity with the brain &apos;s capacity -- except you use expensive pumps and valves .
and we had 500 of these profiles .
without human health .
so we were up on our own top of our field .
and this graph doesn &apos;t even mean something that &apos;s invented data .
and my brain starts very quickly thinking that this is a graphic representation of negative to positive in the world .
because this question is that our external world can predict our external predictions , but the truth is that i can predict 10 percent of the person &apos;s worth of influence , if i &apos;m going to share their entire external world .
and that &apos;s from two reasons , and it &apos;s wrong with it .
we &apos;re moving people when they open their own , a positive email of the computer or the most powerful to someone in their social environment .
hard to say -- a more powerful , you understand -- my dad was the guy on the world .
and so i went . i went to mit , i went down .
they said , do it stop .
they take a huge disk from cardboard .
he was the first digital media media in tokyo .
listen to this ? how cows ? this is four o &apos;clock in logan .
so there are all these things to do , but most love i do , to taste the world .
and i pushed that with passion .
their culture is not coming in schools , and i want to illustrate ways that we can overcome this problem .
it &apos;s so nervous , because girls don &apos;t want to go to schools where there are no boys .
and over little moments in my life .
or mothers who have raised boys ?
we need to change attitudes to young people in elementary school .
and you have the impression that you think that &apos;s okay .
let &apos;s see where this hypothesis is going to be .
is this a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we believe that we can give these &quot; why &quot; the &quot; &quot; what &quot; is the basic evidence of nature .
i &apos;m going to try and do that at the end , and i &apos;m also excited if it works .
and that was really a major lesson for me , that you can &apos;t really act in an object .
so , for example , we created a newspaper , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s connected to my ipad , and it &apos;s a software that &apos;s going on on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a laser , so i added them to a more of the time , so that people respond to the glass , so that people respond to them .
i &apos;m going to be a man in the middle of my current day , and then i &apos;ll turn into an old man .
in 1800 , we have been allowed .
radio : what do you think about it ?
just fold the wings together and drive them on .
so i &apos;m going to ask you another question .
and he took a royal village , with a little bit of a royal , who had instructions , and the instruction , and night , but the secret instruction , it doesn &apos;t really work very well .
because they found that the human behavior is more likely to be more likely to be more likely .
yet , we need to create a clear principle of carbon &apos;s most sophisticated , which is where you can create this kind of value , and it &apos;s also a lot of fair .
now , if we all have all these tools available to us , we just have to ask the question -- and probabilities and the most sophisticated , and we &apos;ve done this -- how we use these smart things .
they &apos;re leading the new consumer policy .
they give little , more educated , more skilled .
i felt passion , soul and heart , left my body .
audience : no .
sb : no , not &quot; without &quot; without . &quot;
all around us , we have a different replicator in this kind of different replicator in the culture of culture .
they probably bought them .
imagine the world full of brains and more memes than a place for them .
we are the only ones , and we &apos;re the only ones .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
that was dangerous , but hello .
they use us to get the resource to the planet to more and more and more computers , and more amazing things that we &apos;re listening to at ted .
and will we go through this third danger , how we &apos;ve been going to have the second and first passed out ?
in collaboration with the -- that &apos;s the most popular in haiti -- with the ministry of public health , with different amounts of water , we inspected more than 1,500 buildings .
it &apos;s not going to cost us anymore if we do it right . &quot;
and because i had a stroke of 70 percent of my body , it took about an hour .
we also found that it would have been good to get me out of the pain , and i &apos;d have given me to recover from the pain .
and how bad would the punishment be , if i would get caught ?
it wasn &apos;t that the most popular people -- the ones who have more commandments -- less cheated and that the less religious -- the ones who could have no forgotten to remember -- more organized .
so if you don &apos;t think about a few seconds , right ? because you get a brand , does it make a difference ?
it &apos;s like this .
i think all of these forces have very bad effects on the stock market .
but you can believe me . i work in the commercial .
these are the most popular ones i can show you today .
and suddenly amazon will be the brand and enlightened , defined how they want to spend their money , what money is , what it is .
maybe this seems to be a big leap ?
the audience i don &apos;t have to tell you about , last week , i had to explain it to my three-year-old -- skeletons are structures that are going to transport the sperm from one individual to another .
and i knew that animals like the most cosmopolitan here , or even most animals don &apos;t stabilize their tissues by the way they &apos;re silent .
and that was that every skeleton that we found in nature had the same kind of energy that had the same kind of stuff .
all i showed that was really surprising about it .
a funny song about global warming , from jill sobule .
well , i &apos;ve got to do that now .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a piece ?
and the main community , the most important , and the benefits of a great education .
the most important thing is totally out of this , and ben became a more responsible one .
and on the end of this is what &apos;s the area of this character ?
i was forced to leave my home , the democratic republic of congo , where i was a lot of time .
but remarkably , the u.s. capital of the united nations has estimated the wealth of the country over 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not the goal .
they have to have very inexpensive ones .
but could not be done for this angle of the labor market ?
they asked the governments to have to have them , and they have them also get them .
but let &apos;s take our goal , the goal of being new economic crisis is to get to the base of the pyramid .
because they need a whole bunch of these little transactions to make their profits .
he liked sitting on her lap because he said it was painful to lie in his own bed .
since the 1950s , as sir , as sir , the british community was thought of the british society that the sun seems to be the sun .
so , what is fusion ? here &apos;s a little bit more .
and this energy is that it &apos;s the fusion that fusion .
so , about a traditional building system .
we need to make it a power station .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country , and it &apos;s also a great impact .
it was the most important thing that they wanted to do , but they were from all countries that were in the world , the people who had been raised in the last month , their opinion in the last month , they were only four percent .
but the expectations of people left for their future .
so the question is , &quot; what drives the male support for women &apos;s rights ? &quot;
i promise you , she read the message .
nobody can listen to them , they just send them a text .
you could see the immediate effects of the laws of law , or the one of the people who are talking about a computer service , and see what happens as a result .
the flight took 12 seconds and went over 35 .
this is unnatural for a rocket .
it weighs less than a more of a plastic game .
the smallest forces to the sheer forces of the world &apos;s deepest forces .
we can afford to do it as individuals , and we have hearing hearing .
we believe that someone else , somebody else , somebody who &apos;s going to solve somebody &apos;s ability to solve this problem .
we didn &apos;t flew it in the pacific .
it took 10 full prototypes until we had something that really flew .
and so there &apos;s this incredible elation on the one side that &apos;s possible , and this huge seriously , which means that .
and let &apos;s think about our moral being .
and the director was quite generous and told me that he thought i was crazy , and he said to me , &quot; this place is a symbiotic plantation . these guys are severe offenders .
it took several of these events to me , until i found what i should do .
when i started with this program four years ago , my favorite plan was a computer project of the design of the computer .
and you look down to the street , everything is so small and tiny .
i feel blessed and happy that i had to give the courage to my post 15 years ago on nyu , and back in my country , where i could get these incredible rides with this group of ethiopia , morocco and russia .
and how often would my self die before i would understand that it &apos;s not there in the beginning of the beginning ?
and i was a really good dancer .
oddly , these insights don &apos;t mean my low sense of self-esteem , this feeling of otherness .
that was because i didn &apos;t have anything like that .
imagine what kind of existence we could have , if we honor the inevitable death of self , the privilege of life , and the privilege of what comes next .
and this is a cafe on the sea in britain .
but instead of looking at that , we focused on how we work .
we also discovered that as a computer engineer , and a way of getting a way of getting through this structure , we would have a way of doing this .
but we found that seeds -- this really important project is happening , but that seeds are not shown -- in the leading pit gardens , they &apos;re not going to be done .
we worked with a computer company to develop a computer factory of the seed seed , so even if you &apos;re visually impaired , it &apos;s kind of like a little bit of a kind of light and soft , the piece of landscape that you see here .
it &apos;s actually just the first few points you &apos;re realizing , and the rest is just for postcards .
the book is wearing &quot; the blank slate &quot; that the popular notion of the popular notion is that human mind is a blank slate and all his structure of his outrage , culture , education and experience .
well , there &apos;s a number of political reasons that they like to do well .
it &apos;s still not clear , by the way , whether these storms are closed , but they were actually the most important thing to do .
another one , the humanities and the most vulnerable to the universities , are actually in the demise .
well , the other hot iron is the parenting .
and i think you can &apos;t tell that to all better .
i also call the opiates of the way , just like this , and you don &apos;t like it , but you don &apos;t confirm it .
there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no nonsense .
he says , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i think now . &quot;
oh , i live in a computer program -- that &apos;s strange .
so i asked myself what would happen if we challenge some of these online types of data .
right ?
it &apos;s the way -- we &apos;ve explained the war , as a society , everybody from us .
your iphone without the people who make the same shell , the same keyboard , always and over again .
and then it became more powerful and stronger and now it &apos;s a lot of time .
and i said to brian : &quot; what did tony do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; so , is it true that you &apos;re going to be in a fake ? &quot;
but how do you do a mentally normal way ?
so all of these things that were on tony , they were proof of the story of their brilliance , that he &apos;s going to be a little crazy .
he came in failing businesses and the 30 percent of the workforce , and they turned american cities just like this .
and i added , &quot; i have a list of psychopathic features in my pocket .
and the jewelry are always the most dangerous aspects of the personality .
so , that was , two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended .
in fact , the trend went to the rest of the world .
and as a result of these conversations , it &apos;s very , very difficult to say , i represent the true islam .
it may be that a great war between east and west became a lot of the way that it was about communism , and it &apos;s needed to be the framework of polio .
and even though the president of the president , for reasons , really , really well , has met to be a lot of the enemy , there &apos;s no enemy , there &apos;s nevertheless , a natural impulse on the ground , the other side of the other side than enemy .
when the treasure passed down 2000 , you just watched the peak of the best , the most popular , the scientists who had ever been recorded for african penguins -- that at that time as endangered species .
the day after we came up , two of us were faced with the census of the room 2 , and space two involved more than 4,000 penguins .
we &apos;ve used this method in the treasure rescue .
and that &apos;s really important because the african penguin was explaining a year to an endangered species .
on the top row , on the top of a day , on the street , a computer designer , in the kitchen , and even before the police department , and even before the police station .
people are open to the most open .
we launched this campaign -- very fun -- &quot; every egg counts &quot; .
this is not a good class of the second grade .
these lessons came out of the world , abstract .
hillel hired himself to a leg and said , &quot; what &apos;s the point of life , your neighbors don &apos;t do it . that &apos;s the rest of the line . the rest are comments .
now -- that &apos;s not the whole story .
and achilles takes a body carefully and reward it carefully to the father , and the two men see each other and recognize each other as divine .
this view of the cells really led me to biology and science , looking at living cells in the microscope .
every grain of sand has a size of a tenth of a millimeter .
you can see these miniature patterns .
this picture was the beginning of the design industry .
we all look at the same from inside , believe me .
the walls are 700 mm of thick , solid concrete .
and that on the left is an x-ray .
it has human associations .
in x-ray , we see all the little bits of plastic in the corners .
i had to go to the car in the middle , for that , for a while , for themselves .
yes , you &apos;ve given 12 monkeys to be approved for a week , and after this week , they just used it as a toilet .
the science actually says that we will live forever .
no , i &apos;m going to get a tooth out .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you . goodbye .
where do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we &apos;re not sure .
not professor and effort , only two spirits , ready to get ready .
and then my life was fine .
everything i saw in the manufacturing was that it was right about the most difficult time between the food industry and the most expensive .
would you be even the time to process the information ?
we spent a lot of time with this one billion dollars , and they &apos;re listening to right -- a billion of the time that he was working on , and what we found was shocking , but what we found was shocking , but later .
then there &apos;s dan etete .
we were upset that these companies had rapidly had their own business companies , and the most important in london is very , very much more of them .
this is too complex and difficult to change it .
we &apos;re all going to die . we &apos;re all going to be old . we &apos;re all going to leave .
there are places that you can &apos;t go to think of , the worlds you can &apos;t think of anymore .
they have a more freedom and a freedom of that i believe that it &apos;s a new set of new gas systems .
she made the decision to get no more sophisticated or more , but her life is devoted to that that this is not happening .
we &apos;re all refugees .
but you &apos;re going to do this thing on the head , and then it happens .
it doesn &apos;t do it . &quot;
i miss michael .
but he didn &apos;t find it , but his staff , but he said , &quot; you &apos;re going to rehab , or you &apos;re going to die and die . &quot;
ah ! we meet them , the secret beloved . let &apos;s pull out .
if it &apos;s on the box , which is the most expensive , then it &apos;s forming .
the characteristics that make the word a jerk is so often to see in adults that we should eradicate this age of the age of the age of the age of being , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to be exposed to , to criticize behavior and irrational thinking .
if i &apos;m going to get the ability to get my sister back , the 10 percent interest i &apos;ve been struck on her last loan , i will be able to get her ability to get more money from me to her .
it &apos;s why we don &apos;t live in the dark times .
and the third one is all the sound we &apos;re creating , the most sophisticated .
this is after selective replacement .
there are many of the wooden lanes , among other people , like animals , and they taught us to sing that , and sing that i &apos;m going to be doing for another time .
so that was extremely embarrassing .
and if you wonder how much that is , this is 16 kb here .
so 37 is our demographic .
it &apos;s very impressive and a very beautiful concert .
and these are the themes that are actually on the heart .
a generation that makes so much meaning from video games , when it comes from real world .
all of these are problems outside of my own .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of video games mean for our civilization .
end ! end ! that &apos;s it .
he would love that right .
so , you get fast from the simple to the complex , if you do more . that &apos;s what we like .
and then they look at them , and the intrinsic -- i thought that for a long time , i thought that &apos;s a long time to tell me that they &apos;re going to be a little bit more like that .
it &apos;s going to go into the other direction .
girl : there was a sphere and a community service , because it &apos;s two completely different metal relationships , and if you fall to it at the same time , you may fall down .
but we could train a thousand new teachers to save our lives .
and it &apos;s a very high point of view . &quot;
ultimately , we will change ourselves as well as we have changed the world around us .
that &apos;s going to have incredible effects .
why do they do what they do ?
everybody would want to be the new version .
they &apos;re really affected us .
they &apos;re actually going to go through this time .
i &apos;m going to be able to put his words back in the order of order .
&quot; well , &quot; i said , &quot; strange , you ask that .
it &apos;s like , &quot; you don &apos;t need to do it again . &quot;
we saw ourselves , and i was grateful because she said , &quot; wow ! this is awesome . &quot;
the goal of the project is very simple .
this is completely personalized medicine in the field .
now the answer is a team of a team .
i work with the textbook and the most serious thing that has been created in the project , which has been causing problems that have not been able to have .
in medicine , there are so many people who don &apos;t want to change change , just right , if a nuclear engineer has the answer .
you can really find novel solutions that haven &apos;t been seen before , and that &apos;s very quick and simple .
yeah , good , you guys do my life because it was a little bit more like the most beautiful , beautiful vibrating form .
no , but it &apos;s true : the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i met the most popular .
and i didn &apos;t get them to draw nice cartoons .
thank you .
so , &quot; our lonely earth &quot; gave me a lot of people to meet the audience .
we have a lot of time for the existence of animals on this planet as they &apos;ve been here before we &apos;ve been able to reach the second microbial era .
his impact is the distribution of this very thin , thin , and we had a very , very fierce death of dinosaurs , death of these beautiful , skilled , and more , and more , and so far , and so much other .
it &apos;s the supreme bombsight , the t. rex of his time .
they hate us .
this is when material comes from the deep of the earth and the surface , spread over the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m a little bit of a shoreline from the coast , what will happen to me ?
they have an accident . they have two choices : they &apos;re going to die , or they take the hydrogen sulfide and , say , 75 percent of them will be saved .
it &apos;s a blessing : blessing and curse .
some of you are countries that think that deregulation or even no regulation is the best way to promote investment , investing .
the answer is just : the chinese define these factories as chemical entities , not as a function of it , and don &apos;t check them .
i don &apos;t know what we can do , but i can use my office to bring them together to develop a solution . &quot;
they need a safe environment .
now , we have the impression that it &apos;s about the beginning of a new kind of pulse of the regulation of international tasks .
human rights is a very simple question : can i give this people back to this ?
or to find the young , the young that has put the fire on the beginning to see if you can change it . &quot;
okay , ready ? go .
i was fire and the flame .
again , again , we saw the spoken word of the word walls .
after the fight , he shook his house , he said , &quot; you &apos;re a god . &apos; no , anderson , you &apos;re the god . &quot;
i travel a lot , if i teach , and i don &apos;t always get to see how my students get their third step , but i had the happiness , in her head , to see her journey as evolved as she did .
my parents have called me sarah , which is a book name .
i want to first talk about some ideas that have driven me , to become a more unfair thing .
when i saw that the war for everyone who had been involved in the same incredibly sophisticated consequences , and that the most popular thing was actually going to be a factor of conflict , i wanted to be a photographer to be an war war .
at the same time , in south africa , after nelson mandela had been dumped from prison , the black population was the last phase of liberation .
the next day i went to rwanda , and it was when i got up in the hell of the hell in the hell .
after the fall of the fall of the day , i started studying the conditions of poverty in a country that was on the way to modernization .
a hospital of the doctors without borders in a refugee camp .
the most efficient is so efficient that the size of the soldiers , the soldiers survive , are surviving a lot higher than in any other story in our history .
so to make sure that so little can be wrong , we have all these procedures at the election .
so you choose to be .
but that &apos;s a broad and pretty difficult topic , so i had to hide .
the size is the population -- there &apos;s a big china here , there &apos;s a big india .
and in all the eastern religions , it was the level of japan .
because death &apos;s child &apos;s going to be a kid with another child .
and what is the reason in qatar ?
they have a great job of science .
all religions in the world are able to keep their values and adapt to these new world .
and then , as all of our generation , we lived in a computer factory .
day eight .
in india alone , my favorite best friends and i went to door to door with this same picture , to every single house in india . we did over a billion of them .
this is the most important thing .
i asked them -- it &apos;s all the things that they want to do -- and i asked them to ask them to ask them .
i think we owe the deflation and ron st. john john st. john , i hope , ron is somewhere in the audience -- over there -- he &apos;s the founder of vibrio .
larry brilliant : first of all , are you not angry because of the injury of the absence of the absence ?
have built a computer system , &quot; the climate group . &quot;
why should we have a positive impact on the world , on the world , as a company ?
they save 85 percent of electricity with an led that they would have used with an old light bulb .
sometimes people think that 100 percent of them will be pretty hard , and we had this conversation in business .
a very small one is paid to be in seven or eight years .
from our 17,000 , in ikea , we are 47 percent women today , but that &apos;s not enough and we want to close this gap and to go to the high management of management .
there was a equation in my family , about that : if you &apos;re intelligent , you &apos;re not spiritual .
this is , &quot; he wrote , &quot; it &apos;s the integrated structure of reality . &quot;
someone , the attitude of it , makes you throw it up or to take the steam out of the ears .
and we realized the other thing that we did , the other thing , the openness of the other .
and as i would go back to bangalore , i would often go back to a collaborative conversation in my friends , where we discussed different themes , while they were a drink of new issues , where a drink is often worth more than what they paid in their 14 years .
he &apos;s looking for forgiveness , and he says that he wants to make a job of his child child &apos;s life .
this particular one seemed to be pretty happy , and it had no death to be unable to avoid even though dozens of fish were killed in liberia .
and what are we responsible for ?
it &apos;s an alarming -- not ? -- that the media of the world is doing a bad job that a small group of activists is able to publish more from this kind of information than the rest of the world &apos;s world .
j yeah . that was the front page in the guardian , and it was then in all countries around kenya , in the world &apos;s office and south african press .
j the impact on people who worked on it were a strong .
and there are lots of information .
i would be interested in what we &apos;ve heard of -- i &apos;m curious about the opinion of ted audience .
and we said , &quot; oh , tell us more .
so you have to be careful with the term hacker .
and just one month ago , it was passed all of the most violent parliament .
and from all these numbers , i start with only two or three variables .
this piece here can be read very differently , depending on where you &apos;re going to be able to get it .
first , i read about this in a complaint at a time of a computer company , which was happening between the most responsible medicine and seven and seven .
so , according to this research , the best news is not to let it too short in a chicken , but not too long in it , until it &apos;s black , and a gothic sugar sheet or a wooden polymer or a wooden polymer .
and then the next summer i worked under the line of dr. kamen &apos;s heads on the top of dr. kamen &apos;s .
and this realization is incredible for the efficiency of chemotherapy , perhaps for many different types of cancer .
for example , volatile organic compounds are chemical pollutants that are found in our schools , and they &apos;re found in the workplace .
because all of these solutions are , of course , they &apos;re sustainable and they &apos;re more sustainable -- they &apos;re a little bit of the generation of our generation and for the following generations .
and immediately , a voice called &quot; kangaroo ! &quot;
after the conference , after my talk , people came to me , men and women .
hard !
a prosthetic doesn &apos;t stand for the need to a lack of a lack of a lack .
we &apos;re all different from different perspectives .
i was like the beijing olympics , he was wearing the olympic games .
about 80 percent of these twin people are young people .
and they &apos;re most unemployment , the most selfish , recyclable , conductive of the banks , the u.s. capital , the u.s. of europe and america that they produce , systematically , to make them systematically .
they have a kind of resources that you can do on a piece of chicken or fish , and it looks like beef .
people think about the questions : are we going to continue to continue to continue to continue to continue to live a higher gdp ?
there &apos;s nothing up there to eat , but the conditions were ideal for the winter .
now , the series hasn &apos;t been even stuck , so they &apos;re the first to see this .
mars is similar to the earth , it seems to be equally noisy .
sousa was afraid that we &apos;re losing the opportunity to lose this , quote , &quot; machines . &quot; they would take us .
but much more importantly , bmi used that , generally , used to create new forms of work that they &apos;re free to get to their customers , and then in 1940 , as a photographer , the majority of the channel was a member of the line , the majority of the channel of the channel .
and i ...
for the balance , i &apos;m trying to do a good liberal , of course , for first , of course , to ask a little bit of the government . a mistake , isn &apos;t it ?
this realization is incredibly crude , incredibly competent .
okay , i &apos;m not going to offer anybody alert , but i &apos;ve just noticed that the person on the right is a liar .
&quot; honey , you don &apos;t see fat , no . &quot;
but another study showed that strangers were three times in the first 10 minutes of their first 10 minutes .
here &apos;s photoshop with her kitten .
i &apos;ll say it again .
looking at liars , you don &apos;t expect to be in the eyes .
we say , &quot; yes , &quot; as we shake the head .
science has been getting a lot more signs of money .
look carefully and you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the entire video of the neighborhood .
in this way , in this much more sophisticated world , it can be a little bit more likely to be more likely to be in terms of our moral set of rules .
and that &apos;s not true , right ?
you know , we often think that language is the world where we live , but that &apos;s not true .
so what &apos;s like a computer designer , if not tragic joke about harry , is acting as ethnic .
six months after that , without any explanation , they &apos;d get me free .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing .
when i was 10 , i &apos;ve been reading james clooney &apos;s &quot; blue country &quot; and i &apos;m broken .
i was a new song .
so i took a little time to study coke .
and in the remote areas of africa , it &apos;s hard to find a good road .
how do you give them incentive to affect the impact that you have on these remote villages ?
i don &apos;t have so annoying as a &quot; casual &quot; as a &quot; of &quot; the &quot; horse &quot; .
they &apos;re going to be cut to be cut .
much more people would have been underestimated .
today i &apos;m going to tell you two things . first of all , what we lost , and secondly , we get to get it .
here you can see the biggest part of the living of the florida &apos;s clock .
if there &apos;s no fishery , because it &apos;s protected , or isolation , it &apos;s great .
after a few years , after five to seven years , the fish come back , food , and then the algae grow again .
you can see the border of the internet , because there are all these boats back there .
if it &apos;s so good , if that &apos;s so simple , how much is it ?
so the protection of the air and the ocean has become a sink for money for funding and institutions , and that &apos;s not a persuasive thing .
in the coral reefs we found that the pyramid is the equivalent of the equivalent of the world , where five lions come to a giant bed .
okay , enric , thank you for having a part of your spiritual life . thank you .
it has been proven as the longest creature in the ocean .
they come to the submersible -- they come to the eyes , and watch the submersible .
and so , among other people , we &apos;re trying to deal with our partners at woods hole , these virtual world -- this world , this is the place that we can get in the lab .
bl : these worms don &apos;t have a military . they don &apos;t have mouth .
what we &apos;ve seen before was the pacific .
we &apos;re going to try to show you the pacific in the pacific .
these worms grow several centimeters in the week .
the concept of the design system is exploit .
and the rest of one percent of a percent of the time is very keen to apply to the formula .
they also have the mathematical structure that &apos;s made by the design of the measurements , measurements , points , dots , etc .
the students have to create these practices . they have to make them design .
and the best , or one of the best parts that we &apos;re not getting is the answer to the answer to the end of the ocean .
what &apos;s happening with the small hadron collider ?
here you find the fastest growing young population in the world .
it &apos;s a lot of the school . there are no government schools in the slums .
this is a computer that was installed on the entrance to their slum , by a tremendous social entrepreneur called sugata mitra , who took the most sophisticated experiments that showed that children can learn from certain conditions , using a computer .
well , the key is motivation , and in two ways .
this is a school in a bus in pune , which is the fastest growing city of asia .
they should turn it into a mcdonald &apos;s &apos;s .
there are formal scales , schools , private hospitals , hospitals , innovation , in which innovation can happen , and informal environments , communities , social networks .
every child to age 15 , which is a place in a school , will be able to get one .
and while i look at it , this scene comes to me , and i &apos;ve been with me for 25 years .
here &apos;s a few parents from teenagers ? all of us have to cook for them -- and they &apos;re going to eat every night for two , three or four , four , four . it &apos;s ridiculous .
he &apos;s all around and eating everything .
these gay people like me , like i &apos;m going to be treated as full citizen , and it &apos;s written directly before our nose .
there &apos;s a lot of fear of people who have to be afraid , so they don &apos;t show who they are , here at home , and it &apos;s not just about north carolina ; in all states , it &apos;s legal .
think about it .
and i was afraid .
about three years ago , i read a paper in new york times .
who were my grandparents ?
it helps us become what we could be .
this is how evolution works .
and in fact , here &apos;s this insect .
i &apos;ve been going to smell one of the people .
it &apos;s not just reflected on 43 to 44 degrees fahrenheit for about two days , but it holds a constant temperature .
but contrast is about this . it &apos;s going to be out of the background .
here &apos;s the american , and yes , it was -- actually -- a game -- a game .
she started telling me , and all the parents here will recognize the most popular .
i have a rube event .
our lives are defined by data , and the presentation of this data is to create fantastic interfaces to tell us that great stories can tell .
i also set up a look at the different set of dna , because you can pick what you want to consider from the data data .
it &apos;s a very reactive man sitting in the box and controlling this kind of thing .
a more of about 11 sheep per hour , which is a double one of 68 cents .
in the reason , you can see what you &apos;re looking at on the left , the most expensive , and on the right , you see the frame of the site as he was interpreted by 16 people who had no idea what they do .
so , tidying bell , tinkering , tidying up , tidying up -- aaron jenkins : and we took all these pieces and the other pieces of pieces , and they put them into another mechanical turk .
but we knew that we needed the right person to be able to put us on this and build something that we could build something .
and below all the individual frames , people have submitted to the project .
thank you .
so i made rows of images , cut , and they added them together .
a dec consequence is that you just see one part of his image , and that leads to a very free set of a very free set of it .
and sometimes i have a emotional response to news , like the earthquake in haiti .
then i went 50 miles , then 60 miles .
it &apos;s like the different layers of those we are , and what we &apos;re doing is the world present as our identity .
another thing is in a public library in san jose , california .
so every building has its own personality .
it &apos;s probably easier than ever before , a good living .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re special .
it &apos;s just too strange .
you know , in the middle ages , in england , if you met somebody who was very poor , you called this one &quot; unhappy &quot; , literally , somebody who was lucky , the fate , not a fortune .
and that &apos;s going to be the youngest court with angels and revenge , and the sky will open up .
i told them the action of innocence , and i told them .
what i think i really talked about is success and failure .
we should make sure that we are really the creator of our own ambition .
alain de botton : a mini , intricate video
if you train for this sport , you don &apos;t smile .
you know , you &apos;re swimming with a little bit of glass glasses , and you &apos;re swimming 60 trains per minute , so you &apos;re never really on something to see you .
they were packed into the liquid .
my breath is down three to three main points .
and they should be worried about me , i didn &apos;t make them .
i swam with this thing .
it &apos;s the only one that i &apos;m interested in .
that &apos;s already what we have today .
the gateway can be a smartphone , or it could be a particularly crude gateway , like today , many of these things are special , because they &apos;re not so integrated .
many of you have given the phillips direct life .
this is a very important part of our life . we should sleep a third of our lives .
ok . let &apos;s go from sleep to disease .
so we can change medicine in the field of the world , in all ages , from newborns or the elderly , to the seniors , the most sophisticated arena , the entire spectrum of the disease -- i hope to give you a sense of this -- around the globe .
so , i hope i &apos;ve convinced you -- the impact on the top of the world &apos;s , and the impact on diseases are also impressive in all these different diseases and more .
how do we create robust societies ? longevity .
and in the novel , a particular one called alvin is produced . and he says maybe that &apos;s not the best way , and destroyed the whole system .
and so there &apos;s no way of getting a dent .
and it &apos;s a great thing .
zoom faster .
maybe you wonder how we do this kind of thing .
our only cookbook is the world &apos;s only cookbook , in which the partial phenomenon is happening .
this is the finished hamburger .
a talk about surgical robots is also a talk about surgery .
and surgeons were more like doctors .
but ultimately , it &apos;s woke up .
they had to give up their intuitive movements with the instruments .
i &apos;ve told you about the big , complicated robot .
and as you see , it &apos;s coming out of the way that it &apos;s going to be useful to do something useful , that &apos;s not going to stay so much .
and we don &apos;t even need to be attached to this .
we &apos;re here to talk about accidents .
but we had a problem .
okay , well , it was partly my fault .
we didn &apos;t just show that bacteria can be the solution to plastic waste , but also that openness to the brain is going to be able to make the difference of the risks and make it unexpected discoveries .
the film we &apos;re going to see is , you &apos;ve made for the most important in new york .
i &apos;m not an exception .
it went on . they always tried to make things better .
they didn &apos;t say , &quot; our style are curves . let &apos;s make the house chop . &quot;
i think in my family , we had very lucky , because we &apos;ve learned to be a design backwards .
night , very good !
ed : and then , in fact , a historic side is a historic site , and there &apos;s the middle of the world in the middle of the world , where the message was in the middle of the world .
look at this chair ? the orange one ? this is the orange chair . 1947 .
because it &apos;s part of where we want to get to .
it was a lot of the outrage of outrage , and they were full of speculation ; they were a lot of the kind of information .
one of them is known : the population population . the world population has gone from two to almost seven billion people in the last 50 years .
brent lawson : nice to be here .
you see the lines check when the population explosion is happening .
before i talk about the cost of the cost , i really have to get to hold that i &apos;m very clear .
this is what liberation actually look like .
but only recently , we can , thanks to technological progress , now the quantum mechanics and quantum locking are going to demonstrate .
first of all , some strands of magnetic field are trapped inside , but the superconductor may not like if they move , because their movements use energy , and the most important people care about .
and i can also expand this round magnet , of course , to form random dishes .
and it was inspired by this quote from douglas adams , the situation is from &quot; selective decoration through the galaxy . &quot;
because of course , they don &apos;t explain how to do it , if you want to do it yourself and have no more a more unfair .
but even though they were not convinced , they said , &quot; okay , we &apos;re calling back . &quot;
so , yes , i have .
so some will say , &quot; what will happen if moore &apos;s law is going to be to place his borders ? &quot;
today you can buy half a billion . and they &apos;re even better , because they &apos;re faster .
but where are we going to get the software ?
larry page has been a passionate talk on our own book , which he &apos;s been doing for this , and he &apos;s going to be able to ask this great challenges of humanity .
they wanted to catch the fish .
this may sound insignificant , but it &apos;s incredibly scary to hear a lot of rumors that one another one , more and more , is more than the last one , or maybe night , or maybe tonight ...
so the tsunami can be seen as a kind of immortal moment , a moment where the blogosphere became kind of grown .
you probably look at three to five percent of the number of balloons in the glass , and it would be better than the estimate of 90 to 95 percent of them .
somebody has ties something , so they link other things , etc . , etc .
he &apos;s finished his favorite , and i &apos;m going to go to a 300 pounds of paper with a little bit of paper with very low plans , but he just says , &quot; that &apos;s all i want to do . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you now 30 seconds of film , and i &apos;m going to show you the thing about the skin .
this habitat is covered more of the earth &apos;s surface than all other habitats together .
many of us , i &apos;m including , think that the exploitation of the oceans are only in the last 50 or maybe 100 years , or maybe 100 years , really seriously .
this one is linked to a cable , and the hands of the sea on the sea floor are on the sea floor .
so there &apos;s a barcode on this product that &apos;s telling you exactly what the product is .
but i want to share with you some of my favorite discoveries of the census .
we don &apos;t know why they do that , we don &apos;t know .
this graph is based on a brand brand that &apos;s going on in the journal of biology .
but that &apos;s not all that it &apos;s done .
as an architect , i have something like that .
mitchell joachim : don &apos;t build a house , grow it !
i think that &apos;s very interesting and very , very disappointing , because what you &apos;ve heard in the last few days is to go to the point : directions that are specific and unique for the problems .
now , we all think that the most obvious thing is , obviously , a great romantic poet was a lot of us , and he wrote a few wonderful essays , and the most famous essay is a called &quot; defense of poetry . &quot;
i &apos;m going to read you this .
and at a certain time of his life , they &apos;re going to be on rocks .
but let me show you the latest african engineering .
if you used to go before the digital radio , the dropout pack , and &quot; look at the &quot; data &quot; on the board , that noise was that noise .
the basic idea of the design system is that you have two sources of information that you have to get out of the conclusions .
that means that i have to make predictions about the future .
now , there &apos;s a very clear example of where a little bit of my favorite sensation of my mind is really different than if it was made by another person .
and in the meantime , i got two daughters .
so they didn &apos;t know the rules that the other person plays .
if these dots were cars on a mountain table , they would have no idea what &apos;s going on .
we &apos;ve shown that we can explain a big part of the data -- people are actually planning their movements to be very , very negative to the negative consequences of noise .
this is from the sea media of marine media .
mars has the largest largest market system of the solar system , the most expensive .
this is my favorite , it was taken only a few weeks ago .
the oldest stone on earth is only 3.6 billion .
and the result of our first was a very popular scholar called ares .
we &apos;re folding it , and we transport it in a spacecraft .
this is about the design of the mines , oregon .
i think that &apos;s what i &apos;m looking at here -- &quot; eight to 12 . &quot;
and there was a guy who sold these weapons for lego , because lego -- the most poor -- no , they &apos;re not on guns .
and then there are some examples of the stuff that are really sculpture .
i have to tell you , for me , everything had changed .
perhaps most importantly , the impact on other companies is enormous .
in fact , politics is a traumatic lining .
now , in brazil , there are 18 times now , whereas the united states only has 700 , and it &apos;s two in california -- and within three years , the percentage of the four percent is up to 85 percent up .
this is not a lot of the stuff . biofuels are a really big thing .
scientists explain us -- and these are just estimates -- that we have to cut down the annual input , and that &apos;s how fast we can .
i can &apos;t wait to see what we &apos;re doing against the crisis of business .
there are always fewer people who are still available to be able to infect and then get this kind of heat of the curve and you get this classic track of the curve .
b is on the edge of the network .
and that &apos;s what happens in every outer knot .
the red dots are going to be the most powerful , and the yellow dots will be friends of people with flu .
would you get a immunity on the ground ?
and there are , i think , three ways of being used to this kind of data .
the building was in construction until the collapse of the economy and death of the center of the 1990s .
although it seems to be a completely chaotic place , if you look at it , there seem to be a whole network of the web and channels that connect every single house .
in this tradition , the world &apos;s future bride is all going to be their possessions that will soon bring them to their new husband .
what a place like the copernican david is particularly remarkable , is this kind of animal , where people have a basis that they can make .
we can only ask : &quot; how hot the world &apos;s business of the world &apos;s business ? &quot; and what we &apos;re going to do immediately -- or what else we want to ask .
it &apos;s replaced the workers by technology .
you can see on the left on the screen , some symbols that are showing what &apos;s going on with his right arm .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re getting older .
or even if we &apos;re going to get a lot older , our cars to go to people .
they were gone in a moment .
it was always more obvious that we can &apos;t win .
the two specialists behind the curtain will help me to get the outcome on the screen .
one of the journalists asked , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
the evangelical are a lot of the way that jewish strips are .
i think there are some , actually , many reasons , but just a few of us are focusing on it .
he was burned by the fire , he blew her , he was like a computer designer , a little bit of a baby .
let me go door to door in the international community and see if someone has police forces or troops for these infections .
but for sergio , it was too late .
he saw her .
niall power : a complicated hero
this means jobs and possibilities all over the whole place .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about the free of food because it was actually this year , last year and 2008 , in the summer of the summer , and in 2008 , for every single pound of food .
and i go into these stores when they &apos;re there , and they &apos;re going to see the way they can get out of the fields , and i realize they can &apos;t get food .
we see changes of participation in schools .
i want to talk about something that i call digital food .
and what i found is that instead of investing in subsidies and other things , they invest in a school program .
thank you .
we could do the same thing with cancer .
they &apos;re not going to go to a more of a time .
it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a very reactive device , not because it shows me how many of the most powerful i get every day , but because it &apos;s 24 hours , what i do .
it never became shown .
the productivity of these magnets is so big that we can see with this technique a single neutron .
you don &apos;t have to shrink the tumor .
if the magnet is big enough , and their resolution high enough , they can actually be able to put all the proteins in the body , and start to understand the individual system .
most of us find that comforting , and interestingly , 12 vibrations per minute about the most sophisticated people per sleeping sleeping guy .
for example , if i took this -- longer than a few seconds , they would feel uncomfortable , they feel uncomfortable than a few minutes , and they would leave the hall in comparable .
that &apos;s all recognized . and that &apos;s the tune that &apos;s going on to hear the most of the time in the world .
and i stood there with two very good friends of mine , richard pollan and kevin ghosh .
while we go miles and miles from the street , frozen , the food of the fish could be .
so , as i &apos;m standing here today , and you &apos;re talking to you , i went to the most uplifting of about five years .
just 10 miles before the coast and in southern california feet .
the oceans determine climate and weather , they hold the temperature stable and shapes the chemistry of the world .
there are easily ...
this is the result , if you don &apos;t know that there are boundaries for what we can take the ocean .
in the past three years , the united states has been very much known by the south square square miles as a forest .
we need to go back to study new technologies to explore the ocean .
a lot of my early career , i wanted to figure out how the wings of the insects generate enough force to keep themselves in the air .
let &apos;s study this idea of simplicity .
this is a beautiful picture of the visual design of a mouse from jeff libeskind , and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk .
they &apos;re going to make a more of a sense of a behavior to make any behavior , another kind of other animal , and patterns and they can think that this works in a very complicated system .
our mission is to build a computer model and realistic computer design of the human brain .
he &apos;s home and drinks tea .
if you look closer the surface of the neocortex , you &apos;re going to find that it &apos;s louder from small components . it &apos;s a lot of the sources of processors , like in a computer .
how many a type of type of tree is there ? where are they put it in ?
we can look at the tissue . and we can change neurons .
we can upload all these neurons , every single one in your own single processor , it &apos;s rotating , and watch what happens .
and the key thing is that the secrets of the brain can be solved soon . mental illness , perceptions : they are made of neurons and electrical signals , and it &apos;s planning to be a supercomputer that &apos;s going to be exposed to the brain with a little bit of the synapses .
it would be required two or three thousand bombs .
the air force began to build smaller models , and started this .
this is what nasa did to get a more of the time to fly to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about the behavior of behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write . because there &apos;s so much resonance that you can get from people .
the bottom ? yellow .
if you ask people this question , you usually think it &apos;s something to do with culture .
the countries on the right , the ones that give a lot of them , have a slightly different form .
i &apos;ll give you another example of this .
but to get him back , it will be more complex .
a computer dropout for 59 dollars .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we &apos;re really not familiar with our biases as well .
in fact , in medical care , this is our view .
and radio waves are limited .
in a way , you can only use your eyes with lower energy .
their intensity can be very , very quickly , and they can be turned very quickly .
they &apos;re critical .
but that &apos;s just by the way .
cars have a lot of paper and they can communicate and communicate with each other through the car lights and communicate with the cars and so on .
dna is what &apos;s really mean in the world .
because it &apos;s actually not so many data .
you have the genome genome , and the power of this is a dedicated medicine that &apos;s better than the current -- it has no side side side .
it &apos;s really simple -- just the rake , but we could completely reconstruct it .
we &apos;re not running as small organisms in the world , but they &apos;re part of a big ecosystem .
the consequences can be bad -- if we waste or the earth -- but that &apos;s just one of us &apos;s consequences .
now i &apos;m mainly here because it &apos;s a kind of digging in the dog &apos;s dog at the moment where we have a side of people who think that you &apos;re feeding a dog , first of all , through the rules of rules , human rules .
they &apos;re just like &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; simple , and therefore you &apos;re going to beat .
no , we &apos;re making puppy , sit . boom , he can go to six to 10 attempts .
they are like golden logging .
and i would say , if you don &apos;t need it , you should not be it .
not just with the puppy , but also with the rest of the family .
these are the same things that are so simple .
their children are just to train .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , and this windmill -- does it work ?
wk : yeah . i still think of working with energy .
because even though i &apos;ve used scientific terms in songs , it &apos;s sometimes very hard to make them sound .
and even less rare , if it &apos;s accompanied by the street and the most important , as in my case .
one is a white flash of light .
64 with 75 .
let &apos;s look at the third question .
the desert expand a mile or two per year .
the homo erectus gave the same tool over 30 generations .
you can teach you in the lab , a little bit of trade-offs , and there &apos;s also a more mature thing in other animals , but the exchange of a object is never happening .
it &apos;s the wealth ; the satisfaction of your own needs , time to save time .
we &apos;ve reached this as a species .
but there &apos;s no evidence for that .
and when people started doing this , the objects like this was a very noisy thing , that a exchange between groups existed .
but who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
but that &apos;s me also because of the connections that people are taking , and the way they never have the opportunity to be able to do and to mate and to mate . i &apos;m sure that technology continued to expand and improve the nuclear system .
this is as high as a building building , and i &apos;ve been here as compared to the statue of the statue .
but we don &apos;t talk about it , but we don &apos;t take it seriously .
they &apos;re just away , these feelings , they are gone .
if we think about the most important organizational detection detection events , usually the fast development is the problem because how can we discover things all the time that change all the time ?
i &apos;ve talked about this -- you know this situation if you don &apos;t get a diagnosis in the hospital ?
what about real people ?
we did a part of their viruses ; it &apos;s new , so far , the rhinoviruses .
after 10 more days with fever , she came back -- still a fever -- she has a little bit of oxygen -- little oxygen in her lungs .
it wasn &apos;t even a lot of sequenced .
it &apos;s a classic retrovirus , but it &apos;s completely new . nobody has ever seen it before .
a huge battery could already be that .
so , instead , we do something that fits to the design of the ocean .
i got a little bit of a high density on a lower surface , a high density , a high salt , and a molten salt in between .
but david is young and smart and he wants to make a more transformative , and so he builds up the first battery battery with this chemical composition .
so what do we learn from all of this ?
this video was taken in the field of the coast , six miles before the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast .
quickly , we realized that our garage was not big enough for this growing project .
i started to think of maria &apos;s , and i &apos;m interested in the way that you and how you found this kind of energy and how important you found that kids discover things and they won &apos;t be taught to be a open way of being in an open way .
evolution is often seen as this one way that we chose , but it &apos;s actually a big number of possibilities .
i &apos;m going to skip this to the stage of space space .
our cities are at risk , there are many of them in the coast .
there &apos;s also stars and so forth .
so if we think about the behavior of the behavior or language language , like the social scientists , it turns around language . so , we think about communication .
this is what this expression , also known as proud , was studied by jessica tracy , and she showed that people and birth of the blind people do this , they do that when they win in a car .
so i thought about it . you know , you can see these people and see how they participate . could you get them to pretend to do it and then would be more involved ?
what happens in a long-term , what happens when you &apos;re going to go on on the top stage ? how the following little manipulation , these tiny little bits of this tiny little .
this is happening in the lab . the little exercise , for just a few minutes , where you can really use this ? that &apos;s of course important .
these things . people are kind of like me , and they show themselves .
she was completely depressed and he said , &quot; i don &apos;t have anything to look here . &quot;
they need their bodies , privacy and two minutes . it can affect the other life in the big scale .
swim swimming down to get to your own family , and you get a little bit of an ant , and you get a blade of grass , and you go up to your brain , and you drive a blade of grass like a jeep .
and you have to have a kind of a kind of a design effect , you have to have an answer .
so it &apos;s like i believe richard and i think that these ideas are not being abused .
and of course , they &apos;re essentially extinct .
but under all these ideas that are bound to spread our technology all over the world , many toxic ideas are .
and as viruses should be , we don &apos;t try to eradicate them .
and in my game , it &apos;s called the .
we put some ideas on the legs , we went international on tour .
i know you &apos;ll tell me , &quot; t , there &apos;s no way in music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
nobody hears each other . nobody &apos;s familiar with the other .
you &apos;ll see the orchestra in a kind of kind of a kind of illustrator .
i don &apos;t want to have that that &apos;s not supposed to happen , but we need to be better if it &apos;s about to answer the questions that you have to consider when you think about the consequences and the reactions .
they work in government agencies . they &apos;re drivers .
five dollars can save life .
she deserves about two dollars a day , building a computer system , and she explains me that she &apos;s not going to marry children before these things are done .
finally , from despair , they went and they went to a wise old woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , if you &apos;re angry , you will be the best talk you &apos;re ever going to regret .
okay , the great majority of us .
his message was basically unity , the connectedness of everything and the unity of everything . and its fundamental value was respect to strangers .
who cares while he goes ?
they start to go to israel and palestine , in jordan , in turkey , in syria .
and so more and more of the more and more of the time , and for recently , she has a income to support her family .
just go to somebody with a different culture , from another country , with another ethnicity , which is kind of different and engaged in a conversation ; listen to him .
i start where the story started , 1985 in 1985 .
today , before you get out of the way , who had the opportunity to shower ?
you see here -- 35 percent of this less famous house in which 50,000 american people live , 35 percent of the houses had a working shower .
21 percent of what we fix are follow by the user technology , things that were actually exposed around .
we did it . he got a little bit of a computer .
we found out that in this region , the leading cause of disease and death is the cause of disease .
one thing is , in the context of everything we &apos;ve done , the middle of the world &apos;s king said nelson mandela didn &apos;t go far from here : &quot; how slavery and apartheid is not an intuitive thing . &quot;
i don &apos;t really doubt if you call me a more of the time .
it really sounds like telling the word of the up to say , but if you try to use this , it &apos;s impressive .
with this statement , i &apos;m going to start to show you that kids shouldn &apos;t leave their community to live in a better way .
this is the youngest of geographic workforce in america with our expansion of the bronx .
this is a picture of the bronx of the bronx who was given the kids in his house , not in jail , so they felt a little bit more like that .
we gave something back .
if you &apos;re a big child with small kids , you &apos;re the big , thick man in the middle , which is cool , and they create these responsibility under the brain of the brain that &apos;s incredibly .
now , you might be wondering about these kids .
hold out kids from these stores .
stephen ritz : a teacher who &apos;s south bronx
secondly , i bet that even you see here as a nonprofit , the difference is a rising of the kind of mass of the brain &apos;s energy .
and to get 10 : 1954 , the pig ended up having a heart attack .
people with migraine migraine , who have a aura , have a band with nervous neurons -- here in red -- in red -- that &apos;s moving three to five millimeters a minute .
the problem is that 30 million americans have migraine migraine , and we need a more powerful one . i think we &apos;re now .
my first wish is that the most popular thing for epilepsy , the most cosmopolitan , for the patent of the , for the treatment of the other , is a devastating acronym -- for the treatment of others &apos;s treatment .
lawyers are taking cases on the ground in hope in hope on the ground to the toxins that are providing the poor patients full of pity .
a year ago , four of the five of the five of the time was called ushahidi , which is , by the way , &quot; the &quot; horse &quot; is called the &quot; horse &quot; .
how do you know what &apos;s really important ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i &apos;ve got it first to get it to me .
these people below the barrier , i call them , because they &apos;re really excluded from the process to share their knowledge .
they have to use 1824 as a platform to develop their materials and to develop the world &apos;s materials in 84 countries around the world teachers .
yes , books , of which maybe 100 or 1,000 spending are sold in a year .
it &apos;s not surprising to everybody , right ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so that &apos;s not very hard .
the days of the computer community are over when people say , &quot; well , we &apos;d like to have three or more or more of the rest of our country to see how that works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a business of education . it &apos;s an education project .
you can use a few thousand children with two packets of people .
so it &apos;s like an electronic book .
everybody says that &apos;s a $ 100 laptop that can &apos;t do it .
and that &apos;s the launch .
they click around things and stare at screens . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no . there &apos;s a better way . &quot;
we &apos;re all playing &quot; i love lucy &quot; on a large line of information , and we can &apos;t keep up .
thank you .
i think most people think that a hiv-positive mother , still , still , is resistant to her child .
that &apos;s not possible . it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s going to be good . you &apos;ll live .
first of all , the most popular to prevent .
two years ago , one of the mentor mothers came to me and told me a story .
how do you build a better health system ?
the most important thing is , how simple is the system .
if you look at the volume of the gray substance in the age of four to 22 years , it takes the same thing to be in the early adolescence . it &apos;s in the early adolescence .
the idea that your father in public singing , so she had been to get to be a self-assembling .
this is the most important thing that we built together .
after the first year , it was invited by the sidewalk electronica museum in austria to install it in his lobby and i &apos;m happy to say that there was a day online , 24 hours a day .
but at night , while we were going to go , i asked the tele-actor , like the most cosmopolitan , that she would kiss sam doyle .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place where my family has been working for four generations in the prison system .
so , i &apos;ve got no idea what it &apos;s about with playwright , but they &apos;re incredibly reactive .
the first thing you see in the world &apos;s brain is the terrible force of the brain &apos;s .
he catches it around my leg , and he picks me up , brings me to a vehicle , and i can bring myself to a doctor .
it was a depression in the ground .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about you . &quot;
we &apos;ve calculated that 200 years of the end of our direct field is the world &apos;s end .
so it &apos;s so easy to see technology as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect , as technology .
she &apos;s the most popular of my favorite .
i &apos;d like to think -- thank you .
and i can assure you : corn is in everything .
you should know that in every community , the number of people who are already rising in the world are rising .
i &apos;ve led three main classes in antarctica .
but tell me where they &apos;re , and what country they are . &quot;
we also explored the surface of the islands -- a very important tool of birds , one of the most important things in the pacific .
and we &apos;re facing the rest of the world a problem .
he coined the term &quot; reverse fishing license . &quot;
of course , the most open sea and the open seas , but the most open sea , the one that everybody likes to look at was in trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific , with huge amounts of water and huge amounts of water .
now there &apos;s a lot of time , immediate , automated , automatic , accessible to many of our devices , even on the smartphone .
it &apos;s an endless debate , and there &apos;s no conclusions , no one answer . but if you &apos;re a big geek like me , you say , &quot; well , what are the data ? &quot;
instead , he has very carefully documented what happens again when technology is going to be in a environment and in a community .
so there &apos;s , of course , two different ways .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a yves photograph .
i mean , it was at least , like it was happy to me .
now , there was a question that i was going to do in my head , which is , well , i can do more of the things that i like to do in design , and less of those that i don &apos;t like to do that way ?
and here it is from the front .
they &apos;re a terrible situation without the end of the road .
they &apos;re going to be fooled in hospitals .
as a 15-year-old , for example , i was considered as an extraordinary honor in southern india , because i knew the most amazing , and i know how to use a computer company , and i can work quickly with the most expensive .
i &apos;ve seen this value of older people in so many of my friends who are in their 60s , &apos; 70s , &apos; 80s and 90s , and the 90s , and doctors .
as christian , and the very unfortunate of the street was made , and made of a lot of the design of the street , young jewish men in the united states , and canada was batman , and superman who &apos;s also back to the bible .
the case of the world &apos;s last muslim u.s. american .
the biggest bad boy , no , don &apos;t want these rocks to be a lot of the stones , so he tries to prevent them to the bottom of the line .
and one of my favorites is , of yemen , from yemen .
&quot; and , when does the article come out ? &quot;
so , it &apos;s got to be something that we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous when a group of themselves identified themselves as extremely .
and the most important thing is , from islam , strangers .
let &apos;s look at it .
let me highlight for you .
let me show you this .
and when i started designing , i discovered something weird about myself .
so they have the eye and then they come to the concepts .
but of course , china has a tremendous population .
but what that shows is that this kind of visualization is a form of information .
it &apos;s even a pleasure to be involved with you , because you &apos;re visual .
the most popular project is named after the eden project .
why don &apos;t it smell like potato or the other things that smell ? so there are two theories .
and a theory allows a less to work .
now after a few months of learning , i discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule that you call a kind of molecule , and that &apos;s exactly the same vibration .
this is the basis for the device that these two people built from ford .
they made it ... and it &apos;s just like coumarin .
that was a good thing .
now , at the time , a series of things that i want to pay on is that i want to pay attention to you .
and she actually didn &apos;t have an idea of the context where she landed .
norman !
i didn &apos;t say anybody goodbye , neither my mother , my father , my sister , my brother , my brother , my brother , my cousins , my grandparents , my grandparents , my grandparents , my grandparents .
i reports . i reports from it just to say that i had two things when i left the orphanage i wanted to do . that was one , my family , and the other was to write poems .
and this is how we look for them .
and then you hope that one of us is going to go through there and get small parts .
he had a more confused and he has to be confident of other , female and probably much smaller family families to reach his age of 12 years .
is this a good evolutionary adaptation or will it lead to that we will be the testes that exist on the planet on earth ?
but will we do that or will we take nature from the way ?
one day , a few weeks or maybe a year later , i was with my favorite in a store for a village for a while , and i wanted to buy a little bit of a card .
that meant a fundamental change for me .
my dub : about 70 layers of this , to get a little more educated .
you want to know how obsessed i really am ? this project is just for me , and yet i went to buy a chinese newspaper from the san francisco newspaper to get the bird sensible to get out of the bird ...
when we go to the way to the spectacular blue mountains in the west of sydney , it was a perfect white machine : sunlight , the smell of the quantum and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you &apos;re ever going to walk again , only with a baby &apos;s game . &quot;
i remember my father moved me out in the wheelchair , and i was out of the top , and i was just out of the top , and i felt the sun on my face .
they told me , &quot; we &apos;re going to put you next to you , because we think that &apos;s good for you . &quot;
she was given the telephone phone and i called the school school , i was going to go and say i wanted to wish a little bit of a book .
and i said , &quot; aw . &quot;
and mom and dad ? were never up up .
i &apos;m in this world , but i &apos;m working in a very minimal way .
it &apos;s like a computer designer of a richard serra of a richard serra .
how to do the hell in three weeks , if i have these things , and i have developed these things over millions of years ?
each of these elements could be on the wall as a kind of beauty .
he was the highest taxpayer in the next days .
i &apos;m looking at individual wine and how they flow -- how they expand and flow . it &apos;s based on furniture , but that &apos;s not the most important thing . it &apos;s made from aluminum , as opposed to aluminum and it &apos;s grown .
this is the car of the future . it &apos;s a hindu hindu .
if you &apos;re going to fight it next to contemporary architecture , it feels totally about me .
this is my studio . it &apos;s underground .
it was made from kevlar .
and as i had my dr. , i had the lucky one to be a member of a computer company that used to be used for the first time to explore the ocean .
there was one of these most popular ones .
he uses red bioluminescence like a computer designer to be a more threatening to animals , who are blind to the red light , and can see it without being seen .
so they use it to get food and partners .
i urge you to call a different science that uses a hundred years old , and i &apos;m going to use a couple of years .
this is a magical place .
so i made it to rediscover the value of the sleep .
and at the fifth of june , in 1995 , i heard a loud bang on the disk that changed my life and ended up with a duck .
and here &apos;s the duck .
after the price , my life changed .
another example of the effect of the causes of birds on the ground .
so , if i do this , this is the tone for purple .
depending on how i do it , i can hear music with the food and i cried .
one of them is &quot; i have a dream &quot; by martin luther king , and the other is hitler .
now , you can see more and more and more of the time that the former general extinction is now the most common .
you don &apos;t want to say anything that could be used to be used to one . &quot;
absolutely vital .
and what happens when teachers want to fix order ?
and why not ? you don &apos;t trust the law . why don &apos;t you trust the law ?
because it &apos;s so , freedom has a more important structure .
because life is complex . and here &apos;s the hardest thing , and the largest change : we need to focus the authority for interpretation and the official of law .
a free society needs red and green lights , otherwise it will be a separate race .
put boundaries for the interest , and the most important to compute , and for the harvest they can take .
well , if you think about it , it &apos;s really difficult to get columns with a ruler .
he had a very bad job .
he had just got a more of the time .
but the problem , to leave on rules and incentives , is that they were reluctant to be polite , and they were reluctant to be the professional practice in two ways .
so smart security is better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that any smart energy system can go upright for unlimited times .
why has this idea spreading ?
people want to be more competent .
it was an extraordinary time . i &apos;m going to be a little bit more closely about the mentality of what we -- america and the rest of the world -- then had .
this was a little bit of a sudden , the turtle .
we have to do it with a full kind of glass .
what i want to show you is what you need to transport 34 pounds high uranium .
what would have been if you had nuclear weapons ?
we come down and bring the trucks that you just saw , somewhere here in the street .
part of the problem is that the most important self is , the most attractive self , is overwhelmed with a nuclear disaster .
it was sent to me by someone who &apos;s a computer company , and , in fact , it &apos;s a hard thing to do .
there are lots of black sheep out there that did the wrong things , and they have the problems more than that .
we can show our results . we can make things better .
how can we tap them up ?
it &apos;s a dangerous working business , a dangerous working business .
imagine we could , because if we could , we could do more .
governments who make most progress are governments who have found ways to allow shared value in business , rather than the government to see the actor that &apos;s the unique one .
maybe i can cut the brain , and i can do my cut .
i want to zoom in .
come on to me a moment to get me into the 19th century , and i was a little bit of july .
we might be so productive , if facebook or twitter wouldn &apos;t cost us so much time .
they &apos;re looking down at the british government to get money for the building babbage , because they believed that these machines were enormous practical implications for society .
these benefits didn &apos;t only give up less wealthy men , but they also upset them , but they also get upset , rather than answering the question of the brain .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i learned something about life .
if you start looking at the very small stuff -- this person wrote a whole article and said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and all of those aren &apos;t old enough , they don &apos;t know how this infection happened -- namely , through these valleys .
there are about 10,000 programs in the world .
this would be the frequency of the one that you can find in the one of the lives of the fda in one of the randomly chosen apes .
wherever life is , you will have this distribution , unlike that distribution .
too hot .
the cop says , &quot; are you sure ? hey buddy , are you sure that you &apos;ve lost that ? &quot;
these are the data from a single survey of a single survey in zambia in a single district , in zambia , a few years ago , which i have .
as you see , bruce willis had a lot more hair .
you could talk about 10,000 , 20,000 or 30,000 dollars , if i had the time , or it fit into my plan , and i wasn &apos;t just in vacation .
instead of teaching people how to put the forms on the cell phones , we should develop software that enables them to do it , without practice and without my favorite .
this is less than i did when i went to a year for two weeks when i was a cartoonist .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , in life or in the balloon , we have to change the height .
that can be in spirituality .
and that &apos;s why you need weather cameras .
i promised myself to make the next time i fly around the world , not going to be a fuel , regardless of fossil energy , to be sure , not being threatened by the most selfish .
i think you need a pilot in the plane to speak to the universities who speak to students , with politicians who speak to the flight , and it really can make a human adventure .
and what is the goal ?
this is why all people who believe in this spirit , are welcome to being part of this team .
now , you just need one laptop .
anyway , africa was a magical place .
the next thing i want to create is what makes clarity , which is what this problem is and what it is .
that &apos;s crazy , really , if you think about it .
let &apos;s stop a little bit of the nonsense .
in fact , we can see the first generation and the extreme poverty in the eyes , you see about the ocean , say it and it &apos;s what we don &apos;t have to do . for that we don &apos;t have to stand .
it &apos;s a little bit of nerves .
this year is a test for us , especially for the leaders of the g8 states , who are recording and the history of the world .
people are going to find that slowly .
and with this campaign as our chute , my organization , data , and other groups , the energy and the enthusiasm out there from hollywood to the north of america .
step for step , you move forward , a nurse , a teacher , a a priest , and life will be saved .
the idea that the internet , which has changed all their lives , is to change a country -- and a continent of the right to be able to get to the very autonomous -- to make me out of the head .
lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
now , your job is to see what this forms is , and what kiki is .
now , if you &apos;re not just a moment of learning , this sentence , literally , took off , false .
if we solve a problem or something new , we compare what we already know , with what &apos;s known to us .
nadia baehr : i &apos;m glad to be here .
they don &apos;t fit to all these projections .
pm : i don &apos;t think that &apos;s .
how did they handle it , but they &apos;re personally , but also with their own family .
some of my reporters were arrested .
this is clearly a different picture of yemen .
my heart was three times too big .
this is a list of the side side : if you eat too much salt like a car , like a car , and you &apos;ll probably land on the intensive care system .
but soon i showed symptoms for the world , and i had to go back to the street , i knew i &apos;d never see my home again .
i was sitting there talking to the car trucks , and i was talking about the frequency of the transplants , and i asked him what i needed when i needed a transplant , to prepare me .
i was standing on a dozen machines that thought of me .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these most profound things is also in the u.s. to have 200 percent .
also , the same business is that the same business that we &apos;re selling the 80 million pounds of atrazine , the &quot; the antidote , &quot; now , the antidote to the antidote -- one and the same company .
we started as a computer scientist .
what would our testes do to us say , if you had a child , and i had a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a child , and i had some artificial , artificial , and a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a yemeni a. , a little bit of a little bit of a yemeni a. .
the problem is you &apos;re in my village , oakland , in most of our villages , this connection doesn &apos;t see this connection .
here you see the census of the computer institute next to the airport of los angeles .
i offered five cents for each of the time .
the most important thing can &apos;t be contained , it &apos;s become global .
here you see , in red , the prevalence of the food system .
they &apos;re like a mouse looking at the foot of a elephant , and the biggest part of them is hidden with them .
they look out of their tree , and they &apos;re coming out of all directions around us .
redwoods have a tremendous surface that &apos;s expanding in the sky because they tend to do something called the things that are called repetition .
so , the main amount of stability , just like a cathedral , and just like a cathedral , and help the tree live longer .
it &apos;s absolutely a very basic thing to see .
but for recently , all the doors of the palace are cut open and break the walls .
this was 25 years ago .
so let &apos;s just look at the first time for example .
how do these people do that with these infected computers ?
and you can afford to watch how to work -- how security works -- and try to find a way to find the most important ones that we meet .
you &apos;ll notice that you can see a little bit down there , and it &apos;s a double , and it &apos;s a little bit of the national field , and if you open this shot on your computer , then this program will downloaded and then downloaded this program .
and if you look at the pictures of the scene , you can see that the elevator is the the amygdala .
we have to find out any way to ensure that everything is going on , even though the computers are going .
but i don &apos;t have to do anything with that .
this person is around with consultants .
why should we believe what he says ? &quot;
how does his future look like ?
this powers completely disappear , no one &apos;s going to do that 2011 .
it would be good if people were a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of computation , and they would take this kind of calculation seriously , because this would change things . but it would change things in two more ways .
that means that we see a copy of self , if you only use a part of the most playful , that &apos;s going on in slow times , and a worse and more secure and more secure and more inclusive .
and the happy couple , jill and kevin ? well , they came back from their favorite , and saw that their video had suddenly spread like a nazi .
thank you !
you &apos;re going to go into the distance .
this is what was taught to him , since he was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had a mentor , who taught me how to consider disgust .
what is it that &apos;s going to be going on in life today ? not 10 years ago .
what do you do with what you &apos;re doing , and it &apos;s happening ?
didn &apos;t have the -- time . didn &apos;t have the -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager .
in this moment , or unconscious , right now , in which you decide to focus on something , you can make a sense of a sense of a sense of consciousness , and whatever it means .
you ever did what , and then you &apos;ve got to be , &quot; that &apos;s me ! &quot;
to death , so , god in his infinite wisdom , gave us another human need : the uncertainty .
but that &apos;s true : we need it . we can do it through intimacy , through friendship , through the movements , through the movements in nature .
and there are seven different beliefs . i can &apos;t go through it , because i &apos;m in . the last element is feeling .
jewish man with family in burma , someone in new york , who would have died when he had been on the day , and this man who wanted to be a terrorist and he said it quite clearly .
instead , i &apos;m interested in developing tools that have a big number of people telling their stories , people everywhere around the world .
the color of particles is the kind of feeling of feeling -- happy , positive feelings have shining colors .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was the whole day on the computer . &quot;
and when i go over here , the list starts to walk , and there are thousands of feelings that were collected .
ten themes out of the time , and circle the time time .
it &apos;s called &quot; universe : unveiling our modern mythology . &quot;
we can click this and see this iconic image of betty ford , like her husband &apos;s tentacles .
you can see quotes , if you like to read quotes to climate change .
so people feel like they &apos;re in the ways that they are .
in life , it &apos;s called tens of thousands of members in almost 100 countries around the world .
they just need one step out to go out , and to pay that as common as so reliable , that all the other things are missing .
so look up , they admire the schizophrenic beauty , and think about it , and they always think of the head in the clouds .
they would have added 25,000 recordings that would have done this : &quot; aw , good , good .
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the most popular to buy my first ted card . it was a huge machine .
these images come from a virtual autopsy .
here you can see how the knife is invaded in the heart .
it &apos;s a little mechanical pen that has been built in its inner , very fast , very fast .
now this is a really interesting project .
so he does .
so , very gifted people .
i went to the kids as often as possible to get the academic stuff to the real world in relation to the real world .
it &apos;s not all , but it &apos;s an incredibly valid summary of everything we know about the basics of nature .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details of why we imagine the universe , but it &apos;s made of the mathematics and trying to explain physics that we know .
and i &apos;m going to do something in the course of my career , and i always do something in my career .
in 2001 , i went to her while a computer designer .
we got a lot of educational applications .
this is the first degree in 2004 in 2004 .
he &apos;s a moment ago in front of the national war , and recently was filmed with someone that they all know .
each one is being established , but in different scientific disciplines , it &apos;s been implemented .
i got my first computer as a teenager in accra and it was a really great device .
he &apos;s exploring the brain using mri and he said that this is the most beautiful brain he ever recorded .
and the next few slides i &apos;ll show you a little bit about .
transistors are going to get smaller to enable that and have a lot better than that .
our main system is behind this lens .
i had a gut feeling that we &apos;re wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so we know what a schwarzschild radius is .
i like to call them the most popular of the world &apos;s business , because they &apos;re kind of a bit of a mess .
we can see more detail in our galaxy than somewhere else .
and that brings us a factor of 20th .
so there was a bunch of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff there .
it &apos;s a lot stronger than the other , and the cloud will be torn apart .
and i hope that i &apos;ve convinced you at least that we have a really supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy .
one day i was in the streets new york , and i saw some kids in the streets , and cars and fire fires .
for example , people liked pieces of the 11th that were so determined .
in the first eight centuries of this tradition , the big &quot; what &quot; is to appreciate god and to awards .
and new and improved instruments broke the age of the harsh .
but one question is : what happens when the music stops ?
michael ebert : music and feelings over time
so we &apos;re at the beginning of a new design program .
until 1945 , they brought it on 100,000 annually .
so i &apos;m going to talk about the design of the day , although i don &apos;t know where to start .
wow , a volunteer , great !
but recently , my interest was introduced by a new view of a big way of looking at the big bang , where there are some really cool things that can do .
well , i think this is the latest development of a phenomenon that we call &quot; kin innovation . &quot;
but the element of the desire is really the most important .
we get amazing talks from them .
let me introduce you to sam hoo .
but even if you &apos;re going to get the screen back , there &apos;s a lot more than just words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
how do we promote global innovation .
first , i have to take a service for the audience , and i &apos;m going to take a service of what i &apos;m going to give you , instead of saying what i can &apos;t offer .
and that they &apos;re going to have fun to design their own ultimate , ultimate or worst tedtalk .
well , you can &apos;t compare them to each other .
they hold them alive and give them the sugar , such a kind of a kind of a kind of kind of insect that we call the superpower .
this kind of test is going to use this , ok ?
somebody asked , &quot; why ? &quot;
and he thought he could reverse the waves . he couldn &apos;t .
i think there are three big changes , and in the areas , transparency , choice and accountability , where people have really power .
how do we do that ?
my favorite , sharon , sharon , said , in the world , there are more photos of your head than any other one .
11 countries .
and secondly , teachers were going to be able to navigate and take out the most of their balance as a burden , because they took a lot of sense of things where they have a sense of sense .
so i wish all of you a beautiful weekend .
dna to read and write , and write more simple and cheaper .
paddy works alone .
now you might ask yourself , &quot; what would i do in a nazi store ? &quot;
if you have this kind of information that &apos;s going on around the world , this can lead to a more of the time that you can do biotechnology .
the kingdom says , his laws allow him , strangers , who have an economic risk or a health care system or a risk of health care or the values of the state .
these laws are a blow in the face of science and based on ethnicity and ignorance and a value of traditions and a selective sponsor .
why are you being pregnant when you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of 10 new trials are people who inject drugs .
so social worker , the condoms , the condoms , are not being tracked by endangered trees , not even the police , and they &apos;re being locked down or randomly locked .
there were children born here , people died there .
office for personal work are already obsolete .
they &apos;ve passed the high line , the road , the river , the river below the street , and you come from a end of the end to the other , without swimming into the front of the world .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny apartments . &quot;
jobs also should be shared .
their liver makes the copernican oil .
and they killed the 12,000 sharks at the time by actually being covered by the most violent in the world in the suburbs of the bay bay in the island of the bay .
we know very little about them .
so this tag is going to find the place of a shark , depending on time and the sunset , the water and the depth .
let &apos;s look at the blobs of what &apos;s going on with the genes that are passed from the parents , then we see that basking sharks , compared to the first study , have a factor of 10 less diversity than others .
so , by the refined websites , this research and found that the size is about 9,000 .
and what was okay . we got wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build on this . &quot;
so if we can see the gender of the shark , before we take a sample , we can say that the geneticists are , if they were a male or females .
so i decided to give myself the igbo .
their bodies are broken up with a little bit of the time , and they &apos;re used to become a little bit of the money for any of the people who are going to be able to do money -- people tell themselves a lot of these stories .
no business with no one .
my journalism may not be fit in other continents or in other countries , in my part of africa , but it works . it &apos;s about corruption , questions about corruption , asking people to say , &quot; where are the evidence ?
aa thank you .
i grew up in downtown manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks away from the north coast of the ocean .
i was not reading as a designer .
and had these people ever realized a victim of their own family ?
today , in 29 states , you can be fired in more than half of the country , because of its sexuality .
and i eventually figured that my mission &quot; gay &quot; was a fool in a relational way , because there was a million different types of different types of gay .
at least i hope it &apos;s going to be harder to get your human rights .
first , the world is , and it &apos;s always going to contain good and evil , because good and evil , yin and yang are the most important ones .
and third , i had access to all 1,000 pictures that had the soldiers .
three ways , the conventional way is called the world &apos;s .
this is stanley milgram , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he asked himself , &quot; could the holocaust happen here and now ? &quot;
&quot; my lord , who is responsible when he &apos;s going to do something ? &quot;
stanley milgram and i closed both the way , by the way , both the high school , on the bronx .
here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
the other thing . the self &apos;s own .
alexander ornish says that the border between good and evil is in the heart of each human .
and i put the experiment on the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what anyone could do , &quot; no big thing , on the tracks .
it &apos;s a mystery that was really difficult to teach .
we have a self .
but on my left , a computer of the sun is a very high , which is actually taken through the red arrow .
there &apos;s only one reference reference , which is the body .
i promise that i &apos;m not saying anything except it &apos;s supposed to be a scary thing .
and the autobiographical self has extended memory , thinking imagination , imagination , and language .
thank you . thank you for your breakfast , and romeo hill .
now i &apos;m telling you this -- i &apos;m telling you , and i &apos;m going to make it ridiculous , because i think feminism has partly the task , admit the aesthetics , and beauty and beauty .
we don &apos;t want a heroine .
you can now see , i &apos;m not putting myself in fire .
she talked about the design of the computer , she founded a lot of a lot , she organized a car &apos;s car , she &apos;s called a family -- all these everyday acts of care and creativity .
i mean , it &apos;s this kind of crossword thing that &apos;s different from the homo sapiens of former beach .
in fact , this is a sensor for brainwaves that are reading the electric activity in my brain while i &apos;m holding this talk .
we &apos;re looking at many prototypes and products that you can control with thoughts , like thought-controlled appliances , or a floating chair .
the headset is connected with a ipad or a smartphone .
as these kids can use their new consciousness , many of the harmful and more profound social resources turn around , people who are being diagnosed as different as they are being diagnosed with .
they understood the power of human narrative and that the value we are on people &apos;s worth changes , changes , and growing .
and said , &quot; how are you going to celebrate ? &quot;
my skills and my opportunity .
temporary , and unexpected , they gave them .
this is a specialist guy who didn &apos;t think of how to study my eyes .
i went to a track that i know .
and all of a sudden it happened .
i didn &apos;t believe in my mind , not really , not all the hunters of me , all the little ones in all of us .
that &apos;s me . my whole thing .
what we have is exactly the same thing that &apos;s the same thing , but in one of them , they feel great , and in the other , with just one small change in the posture , they feel terrible .
but i think it &apos;s another debate that has to be , which is about the level of control , which we have about our spare body .
for the public population , you could have put a lot of money in the trains , which would not have reduced the duration of the journey , but what the pleasure and the utility and the utility would have better improve .
i &apos;m not asking for the full yield of one above the other .
sometimes the lines are very , very long .
i think the danger in the world is that the field of economics is going to understand the field of economics as a human psychology .
if the average answer was 50 to 60 percent .
it will tell you that they don &apos;t even hurt themselves , nor others .
yay !
they &apos;re 20 , 30 years back .
but that didn &apos;t mean i have a coin with my head on both sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but that &apos;s our skin of the visible universe .
thank you .
hyperscore , we had fair , really strong effects in children around the world , and now people are every ages .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful , who wants to live forever .
hello . my name is dan &apos;s ted , and i &apos;m 34 years old and i have cerebral cables .
this is actually the score of dan &apos;s piece that he &apos;s completely composed in hyperscore .
odysseus said , &quot; well , we do a more of the time .
there &apos;s first time the present self .
i have to write five pages a day for articles , or i had to give five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that this is going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you is the last little time machine that i &apos;ve done with hal &apos;s machine , which was made with hal &apos;s , which was introduced me from my co-author at a previous project bill stoll .
it &apos;s pretty good that it &apos;s not affecting people , because if one of the faces smiles , then the other face is suspended .
this is one of the reasons that so much of what we think about western science , mathematics and engineering , actually in the first few centuries of our foreign field , the most sophisticated , the most important , developed in the first few centuries of our dna .
x is the unknown because it &apos;s not &quot; sh . &quot;
so it &apos;s not that if you &apos;re talking to mental illness , you probably have stories of the disease , you &apos;re probably being heard of the other of the world &apos;s lives , shame and discrimination in almost all life lives .
something more than 30 years ago , nations in the world of the world gave up the world &apos;s legendary explanation .
what &apos;s it about ?
if you look at the level of species , you &apos;ve heard about the fish .
so , you see , this profit is more closely , you see that almost 8,000 of this dollar are actually subsidies .
that was in the early adopters , when india was going to be driving up to the world , when the government was going to go to the inner -- for china to the occupation of eight , nine percent , 10 percent and asked himself , why can &apos;t we do that ?
it &apos;s not going to be able to do it in a happy situation , but they have trust and the courage , and the courage to say , &quot; we &apos;ve calculated .
green carbon , so the emissions through deforestation and agriculture , and blue carbon are producing 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it to win .
i didn &apos;t know what these things were , and the thick , by the way , not -- sydney .
i also liked these intellectual feats .
and he said he was basically the same relationship to his father .
there was a theory .
he did it again .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t move in the course of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed the whole thing , and the color color , which just is a fantastic aluminum aluminum system .
many of these ideas are emitting trailers into the cracks for airstream .
if you think about it , your kids are going to send the tinkering school of the tinkering school , you &apos;ll come back with a little bit of the computer , you know , and you &apos;re going back .
but let &apos;s go with them under their own conditions and trust me , they &apos;re going to learn things that they can &apos;t learn from the most violent of the food of the world .
if you want to throw a device next time , you don &apos;t .
i think that &apos;s all . this is five five minutes . okay .
so here you see sick knee on the left , and here my wife , with flies today , four months after , in aspen , and in good constitution .
how about a completely cold , and not just sharing the parts ?
this is one of the seven still in the world &apos;s population that hasn &apos;t been taken in all the shot .
and so , in the years of bureaucracy , in the years of the year , the most of the western europe started buying thousands , then hundreds and hundreds of thousands of individuals , and finally millions of individual , smaller pieces of print , which should be in the middle of the hell .
but how does our imagination work ?
but we don &apos;t think about the hidden connection .
as edison invented the light bulb , she looked like this .
you have to be quite smart , and even though i don &apos;t have college college , it doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m stupid , because you can &apos;t be stupid , and it &apos;s going to bring it far in the world .
they literally have the door of the door .
if you listen to the most powerful to your life , both of your ears listen to each speaker .
we have the problem that is flowing up .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and the most important thing .
recently , i &apos;ve created some pretty sophisticated environmental systems from the suburbs of milan .
and i drew for every person their own special map , and i wrote their name on this , and they threw them up and sent them .
i &apos;m sure i can see how you &apos;re going to be .
and i &apos;m convinced it &apos;s a lot of time that it &apos;s a valuable , valuable life on this earth precisely with it .
in this mode , he tries to keep his position .
i thought i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about how nature creates materials .
we &apos;re going to think about future technologies . we start at the beginning of the world .
and if you look at it , you see amino acids with the rna industry that you have different charges .
and through a sequence of the design , you can one of a billion fish that does what you want to do , like a battery or a solar cell .
in this case , you see the coming out of this .
if you ask people the question : where do you go to doing something important ?
i sat on my desk , i &apos;ve used my expensive computer .
what happens -- sometimes you have this days where you wake up eight o &apos;clock in the morning , or for seven or when you get up , and you say , &quot; man , i don &apos;t sleep well . &quot;
in the office , most of the divisions are incompatible and distractions that people actually keep working on work , intel .
we all know that this is true . they would never experience a spontaneous meeting that from employees .
so meetings and managers are the two problems today in companies , especially in offices .
maybe two weeks , or every week , once the week , the week nobody can talk to .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m doing this now , and i don &apos;t know how the future will look .
but if you ask people to the three key things they &apos;re wearing , they don &apos;t care what culture , which is gender and what context -- most people , and if they own one , the mobile phone , and if they own a cell phone .
but , and this is a very big but , we have the tendency to forget .
well , i want to give you an practical example of delegation .
they take 10 or 20 percent of the time , and then the owner of the company takes 10 or 20 percent of the time , and there &apos;s the remaining amount of the bar on my family .
it challenges the norm .
and he kind of has a recognition for the values of tagging .
at the same time , the spread of these mobile devices , we see a expectation of availability .
our present reality is less interesting than the history we &apos;re going to tell about it later .
what we &apos;re talking about ?
dean ornish shares us with new findings that show how the entries are shared healthy lifestyles , and he says , like , if we live healthier , they &apos;re going to be better food , and they &apos;re actually making more food , and they &apos;re actually breeding our brain cells .
and i told you who it said .
within this context , we can feel regret about many different things .
when i went home , after i got my tattoo , i stayed almost the whole night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s another fifth .
i mean , even the dumb answer to all of the time is to get us back to the back of the day .
and as i said earlier , i &apos;m a more of a computer .
i thought i &apos;d try to do my ted wish , and i would try to do what i &apos;m trying to do , and how to do that , what they &apos;re trying to do .
no in india . now at least there &apos;s a half active active .
and i came up with the idea that someone in this whole non-governmental world has to think about the organization of the war .
and so we did that to do that .
listen to this : less than four percent of a percent of those who were treated , the amount of drugs would be the end of their medicines or the other way their treatment .
it &apos;s a try and i think it &apos;s successful .
the desks are not square .
if the temporary is used , it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity , day and night .
and people are bringing their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , with green school .
the local women from bali cooking cooking food , and they use secrets that only know their grandmothers .
we need somebody who comes and studied it .
the green school is a model that we built for the world .
my tongue , voice and vocal vocal vocal vocal vocal vocal vocal and fine , and not enough . &quot;
then apple alex came out , the best voice i &apos;ve heard about .
there was one reason for that : that was me .
the most important thing is not natural .
but that &apos;s not what it is .
at first , the internet was a tool for me , and now it &apos;s something i &apos;m going to leave on my real , daily life .
&quot; it &apos;s human being to ignore disease .
you all know the test for artificial intelligence , the test test .
i was an architect , and my grandmother asked me , &quot; what do you live ? &quot;
we treated two main pages as one side , because it &apos;s the one that &apos;s true .
so what is the lesson behind this ?
but one day , my grandmother said , &quot; no , this time you &apos;re going to go to this .
it was happening and terrible things happened with me .
all of the hope in my recovery is lost .
so they went to their own business and they collected their little furniture furniture -- they gave me a pit and they gave me a pot , and they were all .
you don &apos;t know how far away this road is and you don &apos;t know if you go straight and you hear cars and you &apos;ve got a terrible accident that you put in this situation .
i thought that some reason that time has been left and only for family and friends .
for example , the molecular order of molecular structures .
he took me to the most popular of the street .
can we say we &apos;d all have discovered all the symmetries of the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t turn it , because i have a little bit of a little bit of a piece of equipment , right ?
if i turn a magic engineer , and then one , it makes a third .
galois set up a series of laws for how these tables , these symmetries , interact .
so , one of these symmetry we call it .
instead of all mess , i want to know how many digits that have the number . ok ?
i need your last , symmetrical objects , basically -- please spell it for me .
first , worse diet , maybe shorter blood cells .
thomas edison would have been very high in software companies today .
penicillin was discovered , but even in 1940 , there were no commercial and medical models of that .
it was the origin of the world &apos;s head , which had last year his 50th birthday .
for me , the lesson of unintended consequences , that chaos is now happening . we do the best .
works at every computer and browser , minus , minus , minus , minus , and the text is smaller .
they don &apos;t need to delete them too much .
and so a kind of information that i &apos;m inspired by that is my real desk .
a means of this would be like a kind of a design system , so you get the more traditional desktop , and the things are placed in the grid .
now i get to my music with the heart of people and there &apos;s no limits anymore .
but i think the point is , it &apos;s metaphor with bite , and with such a bite i want to suggest that we &apos;re a bit of contemporary math a little bit -- not just a little bit of the , but math in general .
and he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s 2,000 physicists today on wall street and i &apos;m one of them . &quot;
you can find them here : this is a book about flies that you might have on amazon .
these are not the things that are going to be culture . that &apos;s culture .
you can do it very , very far .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s actually so interesting .
go ahead . shake . louder !
i want to tell you a secret .
so , intersections without traffic traffic , so with stop , save a lot of life , but there &apos;s a permanent savings of them .
the answer is to allow cars to get from this side of the street .
warren buffet was recommend , frankly , to say , &quot; what does it happen and do not to make this a year . &quot;
in fact , we see the genetic condition that it &apos;s the only known disease because of the living people in africa , even several things in the world to get a lot of things to the world .
this means that the economy in these areas is desperate because it &apos;s just so much stopping .
but that &apos;s not a lot of a time of time .
not only was it weak ; it &apos;s going to be weaker .
a teacher of the upper quartile will be measured by the power of his class -- in a year to increase 10 percent .
but it &apos;s not a relationship to it , a better teacher .
&quot; what happens here ? &quot;
and these free courses could not only be available in the internet , but you can also make dvds all available so that everyone with access to a more difficult teacher can have the best teachers .
traditional vessels , like this cup , takes eight to 10 hours to burn .
the sculptor richard serra talks about how he thought as a young artist , he was a painter , and he lived after his school school in florence .
if i look at these photographs , i &apos;m going to go back to the smoke , and i went home to my family , i went home to my family .
my parents were great . they said , &quot; we know you fear you &apos;re afraid , but let &apos;s just go tomorrow .
but is it so bad to keep us for so powerful ?
this is mass general in boston .
the antithesis takes the sample , the color , it &apos;s a , it &apos;s a , studied it under the microscope and the informed room .
so in this combination , a solution to this blur molecules , together with a dye , and here &apos;s green , and we can actually ban the green tissue of cancer , and it can &apos;t separate the molecules .
with the nodes , as part of our today , looking for the surgeon , the surgeon is looking for the individual knot , the lymph nodes .
if nerves are damaged , they can cause it to make it , and pain .
if we were two samples of these two samples ...
we know that this is doable and we &apos;re determined to realize this .
and this cell is one of the thousand different types of dna that we learn .
it will affect the normal circuits as well as the people want to fix them .
and one morning in the summer of 2004 , we tried it and it worked in the first time .
we &apos;ve shown that already a short towers of these cells are going to drive to the learning .
and it &apos;s going . now .
i want to end with a story that we believe that maybe clinical use is possible .
now you can see that the animal actually is going to go out and go to the small platform and use its eyes to be able to use it .
buildings are in the air , in the air , the microbes that are coming through the windows and through mechanical design .
and if you &apos;re out of your hand , the air contains microbes that are associated with the most common and dirt .
obviously , i &apos;m a physical very strong person , as you see , so i had no worry , this thing is going to be a 20 blocks .
the same thing for the question , who was the street in my neighborhood , in my neighborhood , in my neighborhood ?
and you can get a list .
one of these things that i &apos;ve been experimenting with is something called google share , basically , just take a abstract term , and you &apos;re looking at google , and then you &apos;re looking at this sort of name of someone &apos;s name .
this is shekhar susie . i mean , ok , interesting .
if you have the second side here , most of them link .
what was normal for us 40 years ago -- telling stories between generations -- now , it &apos;s rare .
in 1939 , the film is older than most of our members of our members .
was the story good to tell ?
why don &apos;t we see that with the same passion as the same passion ?
in california , they &apos;re sent to a crocodile : &quot; this product contains chemicals that are from the state of california as a cause of cancer , and other people &apos;s own species . &quot;
so maybe we could develop a more sophisticated , and that &apos;s what we need to do , and for my job as an architect , it &apos;s a bad thing that words &quot; humility &quot; and &quot; architect &quot; has been said , &quot; &quot; &quot; the eternal source &quot; no longer mentioned in the same knot .
i don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was , &quot; the stone stone didn &apos;t end because we &apos;ve come out of stones . &quot;
and that can be very clear for berlin , but we started building in houston , and all the windows are closed . and with all the products that obviously didn &apos;t have designed for the use of fixing , that &apos;s actually a vertical road .
if we look at the word , i &apos;m sure most of you use it .
since we &apos;ve been taking the most common most common economic systems in a database , we &apos;ve been recorded the most common public in the public .
now we have 160 pounds of heavy marketing , the internet growth in the internet .
we started to inhibit commercial and mixed using buildings so that all people centers and places , where they can stop .
and this is the most important thing in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . let &apos;s tell none of them that we knew that all of us knew because we didn &apos;t know it .
for example , they started to start by the most ancient at microsoft 11th , at yahoo on march 12th , and then the other one : google , facebook , skype and so on .
i chose sweden because sweden is similar laws , like the united states .
and who always tells you , he didn &apos;t have to hide anything about it long enough .
their emails were read , and she talked to the most delicious and she said , &quot; if there &apos;s no right on privacy , it can &apos;t be real free , and therefore no more effective value can pass . &quot;
many people , if you look at a fresh human brain , say , &quot; normally it looks different if you &apos;re showing a brain . &quot;
all these empty areas , the areas where the cloud lines are through .
and the nature of a particular cell , to basically power , is to be determined by which the 25,000 genes are turned on and what the threshold they &apos;re on .
now experts come to play and make basic rates of their own .
we &apos;re taking this material and put it on a so-called so-called a so-called .
so what can scientists learn from this data ?
you look at their entire genomes and you try to find out the world &apos;s genome , which is connected to the genes .
whether that &apos;s the individual genetic background or your experience , we don &apos;t know .
that we know how to eradicate poverty , we just need to do more for it ?
so here &apos;s a couple more questions .
how do you know ?
so what is the problem ?
well , it was all the same .
and it was made many experiments that all came out of the same conclusion , so i &apos;m just going to talk about one .
so what &apos;s the best ?
we need this kind of information . we need more of it , and we need to steer politics .
and maybe we start little , with things where we &apos;re sure they &apos;re working .
poverty is more thorny than scientific work , and a lack of data about the effects of the creation of the world &apos;s impact , and the question of the way that we can do it is , but , in fact , the esther duflo is going to be able to figure out what the damage to help and what damage -- with help with help .
so we start , because africa is a certain way in the ocean .
and the legend is reported that alexander was running through this desert .
but you could say , &quot; invest in africa with 1,000 languages , and it would not move . &quot;
so let &apos;s look at countries , and the specific materials and data .
i want to talk this from the perspective of the capital market .
in tanzania , last week of the standard of the standard , the last week was called the health &apos;s .
if i had to ask them , &quot; what was the world &apos;s greatest performance in 2005 with the world &apos;s best performance ? &quot;
because there are amazing opportunities .
&quot; god &quot; is the journey we all want to be , to be inspired and feel one with the universe , which celebrate life .
you &apos;re going to turn a switch -- there &apos;s electric light .
i don &apos;t know why , but that &apos;s what they thought .

kt : yes .
kt : no , no . i &apos;m just looking at the street .
i couldn &apos;t see through the blindfold .
again , back .
kb : how often do you feel that ?
let &apos;s close your eyes , five , four , three , two , one .
and if you want the pressure , you &apos;re going to make a more flexible , you &apos;re going to make a more expensive , but just if you want the pressure to cut .
do you want it to try ?
you feel a certain sense of emotion , and if you feel the sensation , i want you to throw the phantom in the bottle .
there &apos;s one thing that i want to share with you .
ready ?
my hand is , here , in the way , in the lab .
kb : ok . do you think he &apos;s here , yes or no ?
first of all , keith barry , like our brain can be able to get our bodies -- with a trick of the brain , and then he works in a few amazing scales , and he &apos;s going to make the audience in some amazing scales .
i &apos;m going to go .
this is not for the one of four . that &apos;s for all four .
i watched both religious people are equally obsessed with morality .
the most common thing is almost zero when there &apos;s no stimulation to create .
you get the message from the computer , &quot; person 1 has sent them to this crowd .
we showed that the gift of oxytocin is going to increase generosity in the order of the 80 percent .
i just found that molecule .
he asked me , &quot; what should we do ? &quot;
we have men in experiments with testosterone .
that tells us that we invented this ritual to connect with this new few emotionally .
and it &apos;s very easy to encourage a brain to be trusted .
to run the device to run , you need lots , many people .
or should you do that ?
they said quite a sudden , &quot; you &apos;ve given us a device that works only on english , so we taught ourselves english to use it . &quot;
i decided to destroy my own argument by making an ridiculous statement .
absurd . but i had to follow the norm .
how is tomorrow going to be ?
we need to turn this imbalance up , by threat to pleasure .
i think it &apos;s the focus here .
i asked an incredible question -- &quot; when was the beginning of the world ? how will it end ? &quot; -- at nine-year-old .

with 16 , the children have to leave the orphanage , even though they can &apos;t even get anywhere .
one of the interesting things is of course the naked hand on the instrument and the technology , and of course , what he said about listening to our young people .
now my career could continue to continue .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
from him , the sound comes from the chamber of the chamber .
or we do this , and believe that , that &apos;s what blindness is .
rain . not bad . not bad .
so , individual parking mass mass . but why can i do that , if i &apos;m learning a piece of music ?
in this case , the dove of the dove , evelyn glennie , is the dove of the music , which is why the music is much more than sound waves on his eardrum .
and it became so big to the point where it was a little bit of a time of chandler &apos;s memorial , and rick fry , and rick fry , &quot; millions of people on tv . &quot;
but that &apos;s not the interesting thing about it .
cp : you &apos;re lucky to be able to put it in the live .
peace and love were mentioned .

these are all the things that are made . there &apos;s a number of possibilities .
i became an artist and started drawing .
the question is -- and we &apos;ve been dealing with this question for centuries -- how to engage these kids in science .
bad news for derartu tulu tulu tulu tulu turned the same idea , underneath the olympic media and paula radcliffe , which is a hugely , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very common one .
show me a animal with a little bit of the gills and gills , and then it has to do with water .

well , emily ornish -- one of 500 wooden students and the playwright -- ends at the search of the place , under the best 10 , even though they &apos;ve done all the way to go to the run , and to defeat their baby &apos;s head .
that &apos;s all we could do .
but maybe it &apos;s different .
stop putting the focus on these online sites where you have the only time you need four hours .
in the r &apos;s time , it was always about interacting with things , not with people -- not with a social way of course , which would be of course , and the people really would help to accept robots as part of our everyday lives .
cookie monster is very , very bad .
the remote one was a nonprofit of our group , which they used three of the three different technologies to interact with the participants .
and with this technology , you can become an active collaborator in life in your grandchildren , in a way that it &apos;s not possible .
and the third way was a simple diary with paper , and pen , because that &apos;s the most important thing that you normally use when you start a training program and a video program .
another important idea is this notion of the design of the character .
i have style , laugh , look really hard because it &apos;s not going to be built , but to become a lot of the n .
it &apos;s gone , not far . i &apos;m going to go , &quot; bang ! &quot; the fool is going to fall between two .
when he wrote on a computer party , i was before the door .
i &apos;m going to show a number of photographs and movies , but i also do a little bit of a computer , books and a little bit of advertising , all with the same concept .
from photography , this is going to make you desire , and you make it desire , and you can &apos;t have the more .

it enables the existence of the world to be able to use the world , and we can use the experience very clever .
prevention has to be part of the solution -- that &apos;s important to us .

autism has a very large range , very massive -- the child doesn &apos;t develop language -- to brilliant scientists and engineers .
i love the film , how you all have my projects , and that &apos;s the pathfinder bar in me .
now , what i learned early , because i was not so social , and i &apos;m not my work to sell it .
another thing is the sensory problems .

the fifth time i stand on this coast , the native village , i look outside the far horizon and faith , again , that i will create it all the way over the long , dangerous wilderness of a ocean .
but it was more deep : how much life is there ?
and then we have our main , that you never really tell me how far it is , because we don &apos;t know how far it is .
but , really , all these talks that i was covering , just to get the most expensive , they were very different .
thank you very much and fun at the conference .
and that &apos;s perhaps the most important thing , he lost his self-worth .
he &apos;s going to be the army . the army gives him a rifle .
so what happens when a medium is going to be a lot of new ideas in circulation ?
they quickly had to synchronize what other philosophers knew . otherwise , they couldn &apos;t lead the right way of arguing .
but there was a programmer that decided that that wasn &apos;t the best way of working .
each of you can do changes and you can get them mixed up to work , even if you knew nothing about the existence of each other else .
this is called a &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; car .
something significant , which can happen to a culture , is that you can acquire a new consumer system : the , you know , the , you know , the , you know , it &apos;s a new , and not true ? right ?
don &apos;t try that , what other people do , a little bit better , because it doesn &apos;t get it very far .
and if someone says that you can &apos;t hear it , then not you listen to them .
six to nine months to the end of the year .
but we &apos;ve tested this rover , before we put them there -- or this one rover -- and they made sure that everything works .
so we sent a space on the way to mars , called phoenix . this probe will land in 17 days , seven hours and 20 seconds , so you can put your clocks together .
and that would be bad .
we &apos;re in this , as we &apos;re talking to , the next rover we want to send to mars .
and i know many of you have been wondering the last time that these these starrs are really cool things .
there were two satellites that are particularly interested in us .
it &apos;s like the cycle on earth , but because it &apos;s so cold , it can &apos;t be water , because water would be frozen .
today i want to talk about how this exponential growing technologies are .
so , let &apos;s see how exponentially growing technology affects health care .
this is an example of this kind of thing .
there &apos;s already wireless material .
and i think many of these technologies are going to help us to be connected to our patients and take more time , to focus on the important human elements of medicine that are expanding by this kind of technology .
but the current trend in medicine is , but exponentially gets smaller .
we come to genomics when we were doing the first human record 10 years ago , the cost of a billion dollars was a billion dollars .
thanks to the websites like the people who are in the world , or the management of their data on the street , or google health , it will always be more important , all these possibilities on a road form .
we used the cells from the bone marrow to treat a patient with heart attack , and we realized a more improved and higher energy system , the use of your own body cells , to a heart attack .
my poem is called &quot; dirt . &quot;
her cats , god knows how many , who on their own chin sink , their cameroon , a little bit of a rock smell .
how do you cross the firing tiles on the road , engaging on the road , to look at me , &quot; can you help me ? &quot;
i was afraid , a part of my mind would be , except control and i would be stuck in the shocking of her favorite , and i was stuck in the shocking of her own favorite .
but i &apos;m afraid that the oil line comes from and i showed up .

i knew that there was more open water water , and i had a more of the time .
i had known that , but i had expected something .
this was the view of my tent , when i got this kind of elephant call .
and just looked at the air , i saw the big picture .
and they made it to go and they wanted to go back to the coast , and all five died on the left .
and that said a jewish man , so that &apos;s a lot of it .
but some days later , we thought , with our students , we were going to talk about this and we said , &quot; what would happen if this little guy didn &apos;t have that guy in this condition ?
one day in the years of greenville , the coast of the coast of the pacific , in one of the most remote regions of the pacific , saw 20 american security sheets of their ship sink .
but in a certain point , most of the visions that visions are going to give up , and will be adult .
they have the same structure .
some of us tend to be more specific than reading their fears .
right is fear is an amazing gift of imagination , a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a glimpse in the future , a way to look at the future , if you &apos;re still , you can see .
nothing happened . no violence . nothing .
we brought them into every living room in the arab world -- international , global , through our english channel .
they were separated from their people , from the masses and now we see them , one after the other .
thank you very much .
because we discovered that people care , and people want to be informed -- they receive the internet &apos;s license through our internet .
and frankie said , &quot; i &apos;m a 22 year-old , and i see the needle on me , and there &apos;s blood everywhere .
you want to share a needle as little as you want to share a toothbrush , even with someone you &apos;re going to be with .
so this is a picture of a series of studies of all the high animals in the united states , and this is the studies that show that the most effective ones are effective , quite many of them .
so you can see this awful pictures from africa .
now i &apos;m saying , oh , great , great .
ines is a key on the streets of the streets , and it &apos;s a girl with tail .
she was 105 years old when i was doing this photograph of her .
hey , hey , black-eyed susie , hey .

we were with the car in the car , texas , where i spent my early childhood .
and mother was just like this car .
try and do it with this old song . i sing : there &apos;s a long white robe in heaven , i know .
originally , the brothers who built the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the sound of the body and the sound of the sound .
well , that &apos;s easier to say than .
we were not stupid : we put a piece of a piece of plywood on about five feet away .
when they were new , i came up with the idea of why can &apos;t you take the oldest to the oldest , which is &quot; the &quot; biff &quot; , and combine it with the latest technology ?
well , i think it works because scientists are connected to a community .
it &apos;s important to show the place in the room , because it &apos;s critical , not in terms of where other things are , but in terms of this absolute idea of space that was for newton &apos;s god .
and in a relational universe , the only possible explanation was that it &apos;s kind of like itself .
and you understand some things better than others , and therefore there &apos;s a more unfair thing , and there &apos;s a lot of control and you take politics .
there &apos;s another tedster who talked about two years ago , jonathan haidt , who defined his work in three different levels .
and just to get it there .
during five months , he was going to experiment with a full kind of complete design .
that wasn &apos;t very successful . and so on and so on .
or philip glass or lou reed or he &apos;s who played the chemical brothers who had all played their own mortgage da musica logo .
after two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .
a little bit of a little bit of time .
and it &apos;s a transition that has just been doing so much with the identity of living , like the memory of the dead .
but the most important thing , the most important representation of wealth , also shows the status of the deceased , and the family of the deceased .
if we could extend our definition of death to transmit life , we could have death as part of our lives , and maybe death with something else than fear .
i wanted to end my show with a dance ...
your talk about the water in the water , and the relationship , the relationship between darwinism and the fact that we &apos;re all naked , less , more and we can swim .
ok , gordon , come on .
&quot; and now she has a psa job . &quot;
eight years of american history , eight minutes of my show , are just over .
and jack nicholson says , &quot; oh , i want to be a better person . &quot;
&quot; do this world a better place if you can .
so i &apos;ll give you the message in advance : trying to go extinct .
where are the little ones ? &quot;
here &apos;s the people who have been back again .
how you can imagine , is it a thing , a more important thing , but if you go into a museum and say , &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter if i &apos;m going to get your favorite , or ? &quot;
and you could have my own one .
so we &apos;re a lot of a lot of things , and we &apos;ve collected a lot of things , and we &apos;ve found a lot of animals .
so we know that torosaurus is actually a kind of a triceratops triceratops .
it looks like it &apos;s even bigger .
we wanted to do a atmospheric architecture .
all the water of the world is serving , so we thought that after you &apos;re on the water , you &apos;re going to breathe through the water and breathe water , you could drink the building .
the drill was mounted on a 12 feet .
then you get up in this glass of glass , and you &apos;re going to be the same elevator .
before and after .
this is a guy from salt lake city . this is where it looks like this .
&quot; scan &quot; -- as if they were seduced to commit a computer .
it &apos;s not sure that this would be so taken if the editor would not have been a woman .
by the way , wired is taken to hearts .
analyze the news , you know , when something is missing , as the people in new york did .
these special plants are burning up and other volatile chemicals from the air .
m the most of the time i need to see the day , when i &apos;m going to try to figure out what &apos;s going to happen .
and then -- remember , as a symbol of rice , in a conference , would he put up to a conference , and was criticized ?
pm : are you hit when you &apos;ve made this to the rationale of your foreign policy ?
when i was secretary of secretary , only 13 women were foreign foreign secretary .
thank you for having them today .
malaria : there are eight countries in sub-saharan africa who could reduce death rates to 75 percent .
for example , for example , the way we &apos;re a nonprofit zone , and it &apos;s fair to say that i &apos;m so sexually turned to be sexually turned out of this kind of thing .
to be right today , in your capital , some of you , in those heavy times , the treasury , cut and cut the streams of materials like the global fund .
in the contrary , it could save a lot of life .
if we take this metaphor of a genome as a program , then you have to think that chris anderson is a magic object , as craig watson , craig venter , craig venter , and all of us .
you design something like a cell phone , and in very abstract language , you &apos;re going to call this mobile phone .
this is normal dna , which is what you think is normal dna .
we heat them , add a beer , and they &apos;re turning it to the air , and they cool it , and while the most small strands of the long , they &apos;re going to make a structure out of the long and it &apos;s going to form a structure .
so this works really well , and you can build patterns and form , okay ?
you &apos;re going to be in a way , there &apos;s only four strands of dna , and you &apos;re sitting on them , you can sit on other blocks that can cast themselves from other tiles if you fit .
we have a very high computer program where small changes -- tiny , individual mutations -- take something that created a square of a size , and it &apos;s a lot more much more .
and they used computation , and to understand that and get it better in the handle , how feynman said , we need to build something to understand it .
but as we saw it , we had three main groups : a world class support support that has completely separate , and universal accessible to anyone with a medical event , regardless of its financial resources .
in the modern time , where time is a very important , and the struggle is hard to survive , the ordinary people are in the wild , and they pay the bribe to get on .
in my last 18 months , as a lawyer , the fight against small and big amounts of water , the case of india &apos;s biggest business business is including .
sm : well , the most important cost of the cost was less than 200 rupees .
this is the global footprint of all paper poets over the last four years , which are emerging in the world , from new york to the small new new zealand here in the corner .
in such a lot of content , we &apos;re mostly doing some things to make it easier .
so we use these miniature tools to find unique talks that are different in the creative ways that we have a lot of different fields , which are much more important for their subject , and that , which is really creative between the fields of the fields .
no wonder that it comes up my colleagues because the truth is hard to digest .
the work of the design system could be equally good in a foreign clinic like a hospital .
ted is all of the great thing .
how do things happen like this ?
second , for you , for you , the most important nature of modern american school , and the next step of time , after step , is teaching .
and said , &quot; would you have a nuclear waste in your community ? &quot;
a way to achieve this . teach more ethics courses .
why ? because they &apos;re happy to do something that is right .
bill gates talked about the importance of education and in particular , and that &apos;s what kipp does . &quot;
barry schwartz makes a passionate call for &quot; practical wisdom &quot; as an antidote to society that has lost in the state of the country , he argued that rules often fail to push back and make a practical difference , and we &apos;re going to help our world new .
&quot; by the way , dean , the arm must fit a 50 year-old baby &apos;s arm , so a little bit of a little finger , and he has to weigh less than four pounds .
it then takes another nine to make it functional and useful . &quot;
he &apos;s doing what darpa asked me .
boys and girls , you &apos;ve already given enough .
it was amazing how positive they were all .
he wants to help . he told me he wants to go back to help his buddies .
how do we get out ?
you can look at war like a tragedy or a farce .
ford moved out . they &apos;re going to be a leg , and then the other .
in london i lived in a village with nothing as a water with nothing .
and i have a lot of time . in my first attempt , my breath is still not going to hold a minute for a minute .
there are a lot of people who are going to get to be able to get into that .
it &apos;s a big size , and it weighs .
i &apos;ve been wasted oxygen because of the movement .
then his favorite line came and broke his record .
and there was no way my heart rate had no way to slow .
after 14 minutes , i had this horrible deceptively like this to breathe .
as a magician , i try to show people things impossible .
congratulations . they &apos;ve completed the institution .
tamara , do you take that ?
even now , the human man is perhaps ignorant by the waste of his civilization .
in africa , people last year have 600 million of the indigenous people , and two billion pounds of meat consumed .
first , even if all the co2 emissions stopped today , global warming would continue to continue .
and then we saw a case of the east coast of the united states , and it was moving over every year .
today , there &apos;s another movement . the movement , the earth , to save the earth .
the fifth of the fifth , whose image we see here died .
i want to give you a kind of a kind of a kind of an introduction of what this change means , which means that i want to explain to you what the effect of this change is for us and our biodiversity , but also how much of this change affects our culture .
and if it was just about that , it would be really interesting .
in this salmon , it &apos;s a genetic incubator that &apos;s made of the intersection of a gene that &apos;s made of the oven of a gene and another kind of gene , so he grows much faster with a lot less food .
these are actually intersections and no real animals .
we took this animal to the autonomy . &quot;
in other words , that was the first creature in the history of this world that had a computer as a parent -- it had no organic parents .
paul collier : the time , it &apos;s time to be critical
if darwin had only the nasa .
melanin , in his various forms , is probably on the earth for billions of years , and it was always taken over the evolution of the evolution , as often happened .
and only in the last 5,000 years with rising frequency and distance .
evolution helps us .
tell it to you .
so old and he may be , he &apos;s very complicated , and he &apos;s very simple -- and that &apos;s very simple , and that &apos;s the same time .
then they measure ... and measure ... and measure ...
i kind of got a kind of a system to change a geometry of things that didn &apos;t actually have geometry .
she was in the time of low-fat to 25 , an extraordinary era , where mathematics was short before that the mathematics was a little bit of the time .
slow measurements , big balance movements , ... what ?
and that &apos;s a little bit of the same thing that &apos;s going on .
that was one of my favorite islands , which was the same thing that these islands were the same as the most complete thing -- but more or less .
should you take the chest ? should you get them ?
right ? it &apos;s got to be very precious for it to be a particularly good thing for the tomato .
anyone ? it &apos;s much harder .
that can happen in a medical environment .
and why not ?
a few months later , she goes back to the market when prices are the highest , in which so-called the so-called food -- when food is scarce -- because they have to feed their family and no choice .
that leads to very high amounts of water .
almost three years ago , i decided to leave my comfortable job as an elder economist at the world bank in washington and to return to ethiopia , after almost 30 years in foreign africa .
we build a system that uses all the most sophisticated , integrity , trust , efficiency and transparency , and the little farmers help to cope with the risks i described .
we believe that this initiative requires big political will , and we need to adapt to the financial sector , and even the underlying legal framework .
my answer to this is a wall of bacteria through bacteria , which is going through the desert .
they &apos;re serious to the pension of millions of people , especially in africa and china .
a problem with the plants of trees is that people in this region are so poor that they are firing trees to use them as a spinal cord .
and , after the campers cost of 60 dollars for the bacteria you never had to pay again , a meter of it would cost about 11 dollars .
in a time , unprecedented population growth could be considered the standard of the brain .
the world tells me opportunities , and i picked up .
our goal is a resource of design , so that it &apos;s so much , so that it &apos;s just a single dvd dvd , basically a single spike of a dvd .
all these eggs , they &apos;re , bacteria , bacteria , viruses can travel in one gram of human cortisol .
it &apos;s a wonderful instrument to the cerebellum .
you might think it &apos;s just good conflicting , if these men are chasing shit , but it &apos;s also economically meaningful , because they save a billion dollars every year .
and with horror , she found that the family had no toilet .
the pace is to provide people with sanitation , not reaching .
this reefs in discovery bay , jamaica , were 20 years of coral reefs .
he was fed the slave , which were brought up on the top of the street , the song &quot; jamaica &quot; -- &quot; the japanese rice &quot; -- &quot; the japanese rice &quot; -- is a model of the importance of the state of canada &apos;s in canada .
and we &apos;ve been able to do this in the last hundred to 150 years .
i &apos;ve talked about millions of times , but it &apos;s incredible .
the other species of climate change is the most important thing of the coral , it &apos;s a lovely picture , right ?
that &apos;s not selling .
and yet we &apos;re , according to our best knowledge .
what i saw ? stars , satellites , the planes -- typical of the other .
and what would be behind this kind of glass , if it were ?
i was just embarrassed to be , because i didn &apos;t read the novel &quot; dune . &quot;
and it was so successful that it was even more mature .
and the other thing is a living small city , and to get to the beach , she said , you have to have a bus and then you take a boat .
one of them was called joseph and he asked me what i did , and i explained .
and we put in the case .
companies are asking goods to households -- that &apos;s us -- and we &apos;re giving income to income , and that &apos;s even better to spend the income for more goods and services .
the most popular , the most remote , was under zero in 2008 , shortly before the crisis .
you can hear the thought of five-year-old .
and at the same time , the solution is , because these aren &apos;t necessary to change human nature .
we need to actually invest in the idea of a meaningful wealth that &apos;s offering the opportunity to develop people .
first , it &apos;s not supposed to be economists to never be told , so it could be that they have to be a little bit more like their sound .
i painted it directly on the man .
it was about space and light .
this photograph was taken when i visited the bay bay in alaska in 2002 to make the minerals management service in the process of the use of their procedure , to see oil management .
another aspect is that it &apos;s spreading when it hits water .
and that &apos;s actually really the most enjoyable .
and then , of course , john d. , of course , rockefeller .
it was also reason for the national geographic act , the clean air act , the clean water act .
they have degrees in southern europe , in economics . they &apos;re entrepreneurs . they don &apos;t really want to do what they do .
if you look at people who earn 50,000 dollars in the years , they have two children who may have three jobs or more , and then they have to jump out .
we need to do all the things like this , and they can find more about these politics .
the first person you know .
here she tells her to &quot; afghan star &quot; of how her friends were willing to get her out , and her friends said she will leave her friends to come to the end .
last year , i was talking about my swimming on the north pole .
it feels like somebody else &apos;s standing behind you and you beat the whole hammer on your head .
and we sat down , and we &apos;re going to get out of the bottom of mt . everest . everest .
and the point of time , is talking about it , talking about it , give a hundred percent , because there &apos;s only very , very few things that can &apos;t be done if we &apos;re using our entire power for this .
this is a very simple one . it &apos;s a very simple computer .
can we do a kind of a kind of design ?
what i &apos;m showing you here is that we can make a more of the design -- the b -- the b -- from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules .
these are three minutes to invest .
and if you saw amy smith , she talks about how to get students to work with communities in haiti .
and it may be that all of us are overwhelming in the world &apos;s sensations today , and so connected to the numbers of problems that we need to solve .
we &apos;re increasingly aware of that we don &apos;t even need to pinpoint the whole of the whole .
okay . i have one .
can we again connect with the natural ecosystems around us by providing rivers back to the world , and this is the same thing that we use ?
as you can see , the death rate of 65,000 deaths per conflict , a year in the 1950s , in the 1950s to 2,000 dead per conflict per year , so horrible that is so awful .
because we did something right , and it would be really good to figure out what it is .
they want the most profound .
if you don &apos;t , one of the two are being updated , right ?
the developing world uses soap and water , immunization .
and now i have the most pessimistic on this axis .
and remember the beginning of the last century , which was very bad , until this so-called a big leap , after that so-called .
do you see how it grows ? and how hundreds of millions of people come out of poverty in asia ?
here we are . we have a continuity in the world .
look . this is the world .
they get clean water . they buy food for the poor . they &apos;re malaria .
and we need to see the way we look at the world with facts .
don &apos;t make it all of africa . don &apos;t do any of the research from it .
it &apos;s not sustainable . and it &apos;s not going to happen to the superpower .
and many of you have heard the word &quot; memes &quot; -- evolution is something that i give a lot of attention to , so , you know , one of the first objects you had was a little bit of a small one .
my argument is basically that , well , the fact of the world is always part of our lives .
and that &apos;s pretty new , and i think it &apos;s going to be much worse -- this possibility -- because of the consumer technology in the information technology , in the world technology , which can be used as weapons or nanotechnology or nanotechnology .
i do my best , okay .
&quot; the &quot; name is our main word &quot; he &apos;s saved the people , &quot; which was a pretty sophisticated research system .
we only have in six countries civil war , which means that media is only about six countries .
so , we should put our money out there ?
none of these countries , including africa &apos;s nation , botswana , has ever been fed up its income rate .
as this development , we were going to be the africans , in the edge of development , and we &apos;re going to be freezing in our countries in our countries .
the management , mostly , is cost billion billion .
we &apos;d like to interview them . &quot; and i said , &quot; great . &quot;
and now 14 of the diseases are treatable , two of them even .
so in the last 10 years , and as hope for the future , we &apos;ve seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology : a science of what makes life worthwhile .
and i think there are three different -- and i call them different , because they &apos;re on different interventions , it &apos;s possible to have a rather different life .
but it turns out that there was no sexual trauma .
you don &apos;t look like a bee &apos;s toy .
and what you find is that if you do something fun , the most fun thing is that you &apos;re doing .
when i was a writer 30 years ago , i thought , if i was good enough to make someone depressed , not afraid that i would make him happy .
a polar bear , floating in the arctic , recorded by paul &apos;s .
but this so-called &quot; snapshot &quot; is when all parts of the parts are going to be put together and not just the event , but also my emotional connection .
nick -- again with an automatic camera -- thousands of photos of this shot .
sometimes you can tell a huge story in focused ways .
we want to find solutions .
and then somehow all of you go and jump .
thank you .
what &apos;s more important is that this is a very popular process that you can see in only three seconds : we can actually be emily in a period of less than a single afternoon in multiple different ways and the other afternoon .
emily : image metrics is a very reactive , more scalable company .
finally , i was involved in it .
there &apos;s also a few beautiful primates in the reserve .
but i was out of the west and worked in the east .
all over the time , they &apos;ve been rejected by animals , and they were killed , the forest down , and so on .
so , coltan is lost , and the gold is lost .
one day we met with the most popular .
the elephant just , and they took the most profound .
i don &apos;t think somebody can kill google because google does the right , even if people like al qaeda use google to connect .
corneille ewango : a hero of congo from congo
we have , almost without it , is moving from an emerging market to a market market .
you don &apos;t have to pay it from your budget .
i should give you a hug , what happened to these experiments .
democracy doesn &apos;t need perfect equality , but it needs citizens to share a common life .
the united states as a leading nation in 1900 , because where the line changes to red .
we have this gift in the &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s , when women were going to the street , and they &apos;ve been in the &apos; 70s .
electricity was helpful to the women &apos;s liberation .
an amazing fact for the world &apos;s first half is that in the first half of the 20th century , the life expectancy is three times as fast as the second half of the 19th century .
this was the paper i was covering by 11 years and i got a two + .
i have some who thought about it for a long time : between five and 15 , this would be my favorite , and that led to a sense of failure .
so if i look at creativity , i think that &apos;s the point , or the inability to suppress the connections that i see between virtually everything .
that &apos;s what &apos;s like , &quot; the buddhist fishermen say , &quot; yes , they don &apos;t kill creatures .
and they &apos;ll notice more often .
and i had to find what was fit to the story .
how are we going to be the responsibility , what the responsibility and the causes are , outside a dish ?
and you have to be in all the ways that i &apos;ve never seen before .
i hope you &apos;ll see me , if i &apos;m going to get these examples , because i &apos;m talking about everything you could spend your time .
now there &apos;s magazines about water .
people pay the full price for both , and the only thing they have in common is that they don &apos;t have anything in common .
the corners of the street , the target , is the big market .
these guys are asking the most powerful to the world .
but you don &apos;t have to be more restrained -- you don &apos;t have to be completely immersed .
so what you need to do is find out who it is interested .
nine months later , i was going to see messages at tahrir square . reason for that was a picture i saw in my favorite book .
thank you .
most of the time , the cultural heritage is going to look back to us , and to look at the past .
my first story for national geographic , where i realized that the world issues in a documentary can bring the world issues in the history of nature , i had devoted to a lot of time .
these are the lions and tigers of the ocean .
and because i love sharks -- i kind of obsessed with them -- i wanted to make another more positive story about sharks to talk about the need of protection for sharks .
after i had left the way i had left that this habitat is going to be a new tool to create a new design system .
she &apos;s also caught in a very small way .
but when the fish came back and back back and the population controlled , the city grew from seaweed in the flat water , the flat water .
she now lives in the jungle in the jungle , and this is a lot of the time , her second son , by the way , the son of the second orangutans i saved , the son of the second orangutans i saved .
it was a biological desert .
and then you see the returns and it starts measuring what comes out .
so how do we break this cycle ?
and you need bacteria to bind the nitrogen , and without these kinds of microorganisms , there will be no performance .
the humidity is 10 percent higher .
so we can really change climate .
in the world , it &apos;s the causal , there &apos;s a democratic culture , so you can use the law to protect your own system .
the most prolific divine , who &apos;s a paddle on a giant bed .
i &apos;ll show you one another .
oxfam is creating kinetic sculptures , beautiful works , which are going to be able to get down the pattern , or move out of the pattern , and in nine minutes , he &apos;s going to be with his favorite art -- at the same time , inspired by mathematics and nature .
every city has its own design .
and 23 years later , you asked us to come and evolve this idea .
this is italian portal , the peacock &apos;s favorite park , the southern park , the japanese park , the german park .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
either it doesn &apos;t exist or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or something , but not a part of science .
people always say that consciousness is hard to define .
you can &apos;t relate to the existence of your consciousness .
it &apos;s a digital computer program in the brain , and to create consciousness , we have to find the right program .
we &apos;re constantly bringing the objectivity and cooling and cooling as a symbol of reality and as a properties of neural gestures .
do you find ? don &apos;t you ?
but i also meet people who do what they do , and they couldn &apos;t imagine doing something else .
we don &apos;t teach american history in britain .
teenagers don &apos;t wear a twitch .
maybe later , not immediately .
no , it doesn &apos;t .
i couldn &apos;t do this thing for just working , no matter how much or how much i &apos;m going to do it .
but we have to shift from an industrial model to a solar model where every single school can flourish .
erez and i wanted to figure out more about this .
the reason that is the historical report is being digitized in the speed of the world .
there she went to her light . she said , &quot; okay , so it &apos;s serious .
she led a group of students in protest in the streets of protest .
i stood up , put a tea , put me and now i &apos;m here -- still almost paralyzed , but here .
so peace direct sums up you with the back .
he wrote a book called &quot; the dictatorship to democracy &quot; with the locals , to the world &apos;s resistance resistance .
it &apos;s not a business of the thing .
in fact , chris worried , and he said , &quot; look , show you this photo , you &apos;ll think you &apos;re still one of these crazy modern artists that don &apos;t do much . &quot;
it &apos;s a object for the spirit .
and the solution i &apos;m going to do is , in the world &apos;s greatest muslim community , in this massive middle-class , the world &apos;s largest , and the destruction of the biosphere .
so i said , &quot; what would t be like by the counter -- let &apos;s call him the way that they take the impact , where they &apos;re going to be able to get the impact , put it in the denominator , where they get the impact ? &quot;
and he was a huge high school system on the market that has increased our revenues and profits .
we literally won the most sophisticated .
but five days later , back in atlanta , i got an email from glenn thomas , one of my people from the meeting in california .
so , frankly , many of us are afraid of working in the industry that the industry is threatened by technology and possibly become more inclusive .
and really , we need somebody to communicate for us , so we have a experience with a mentally divine ?
the arts , whatever you do , whenever you wrap up , if you &apos;re going to look at us , to look at our online and curiosity .
the three sisters of ahn , with their passionate music , is a new piece of music , and in tedwomen , they start with the happy and the &quot; sweet &quot; of david &apos;s &quot; david &quot; by david &apos;s &quot; &quot; the &quot; of david &apos;s &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; of &quot; the &quot; &quot; sniff . &quot;
the manchester craftsmen &apos;s maslow named after my quarter .
he makes a bunch of money through the training of special furniture for rich people .
we &apos;ve taken the curriculum of the american health curriculum , which is what the harvard of the arts is in the middle of the country , and we &apos;re going to be a trained for mothers in the middle of the inner city .
we realized that you have to give them flowers and sunlight and food and expectations and herbie and herbie &apos; music and so you can always cure the spiritual cancer .
these kids who were given up from the world , who are flying from public schools , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re able to do ; with affection and sunlight and good music and good music and confidence .
and it worked very well to today .
and i &apos;m going to allow you to take the concert , and i &apos;m going to give you the music , and you should ever decide to sell you to sell a agreement that says that money is used to help the money . &quot;
this is a room of nancy wilson being built in our school last christmas , last christmas .
the brown building , which is your look at you and i tell you where i made my greatest mistake .
he came to me after that . he said , &quot; man , that &apos;s a fabulous story .
and so he has a group of people who have been involved .
bill mistry : a quiet and amazing story of salvation through art , music and unusual expectation .
and the transducer then brings the most expensive to the brain , and the result is a little bit of the brain , and the result is a very common one that produces a normal standard of light .
but there was the most important factor , the problem with the code , and how to make cells better answers to make normal reactions , and that was our contribution .
it &apos;s called us with a invisible model of the attacks that the attacks are going to be healthy .
but if bacteria grow and double and they &apos;re going to be engaged , they &apos;re going to make these molecules , then the number of molecules go out of the cell , the number of molecules outside the cell .
now we know that all bacteria can speak together .
this is just a photo -- a little bit of your skin .
bacteria are incredibly skilled , which is back to the fact that we kill bacteria with antibiotics .
the fact is that bacteria have a collective behavior and they have tasks that they could never make in the way they could be able to act as individuals .
it &apos;s a great honor to get to me that conference .
or the first one that comes into the hall .
but , if we think about justice , aristotle says what we need to think about is the real character of the brain activity and qualities that are worth that you are in the world , you know , rigid and appreciated .
what would you have for a reason ?
charlie , what do you say to warren ?
here it is , as he &apos;s doing it .
so aristotle has to be with flutes , and the most amazing question of same-sex marriage , and the legendary response of same-sex marriage &apos;s right .
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic argument
many people said , &quot; well , you know , you don &apos;t have to say to us , &quot; look , we don &apos;t have to say to us what we should do with our time .
and i think that &apos;s good -- the future of humanity can make such a decision .
so , if that &apos;s what &apos;s called what &apos;s called this ?
i &apos;m saying that the speed of the car &apos;s velocity will be .
i &apos;m saying that &apos;s nonsense .
we know that there &apos;s this threshold because we don &apos;t get any other types of people before we get a nuclear age , and that &apos;s even the damage to our birth of birth .
that means you have to make your homework to understand whether that &apos;s true .
audience : hello . i read somewhere that the average life of practically every one of the people &apos;s average life has been expanding by 10 years .
not one of your media has done this .
we don &apos;t care about how we do our gain .
they grew up in the center of the world &apos;s center and they put a lot of time on the agenda .
but i can &apos;t present the way to present the world &apos;s favorite , the most important thing that i have from economists , epidemiologists and environmental services .
the key thing is something creepy , and probably you know a part of the brain &apos;s point .
fourteen americans die per day at asthma , three and a half , and almost everything comes from the street .
he was obviously making sense of humor .
politicians and the people have fear to market , as a &quot; eureka &quot; .
second , because we &apos;ve eradicated them .
so we thought , &quot; we &apos;re trying . &quot;
there are some amazing animals .
immediately , government said , &quot; enough -- we &apos;re going to go . &quot; and we pay people to get people to get them out of the street .
he may think he would have the baby &apos;s baby ever born , so he might need a little help from the outside .
i asked peter , if something changed , and he said , &quot; no . &quot;
we want to deal with africa now , the next chapter , and that &apos;s it : a healthy , more beautiful african , beautiful african .
but most importantly , you have to be productive in your life , and create a kind of productive environment in our countries , so that things can be done .
we can connect this to all ?
we were on the side of the world &apos;s side .
i had to crawl through the legs of these people , and i had to crawl through my sister to find a window .
you know , we need to use everything .
and i &apos;m not seeing african employees in the many times .
the question is now how we can use to use all of this good , which is coming from us ?
you &apos;re a lot of the time . &quot;
we have a lot of plastic experts in nigeria with the food team .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is effective , i took this case , so i took this case to study it , so we can study it , just as we can study any other complex neurological process .
the method was applied since the &apos; 90s to study very complex processes .
i want to try and show this for you briefly .
and then i &apos;m in the control room , here , games in change .
now , how do you study rap scientifically ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity that &apos;s happening in the field of life .
i want to say , probabilities and statistics , that &apos;s the mathematics of games and the internet .
this is very time-consuming and it &apos;s not pleasant .
but keep the idea of the eight seconds of eight seconds .
in play and virtual worlds , for example , your facial expressions can be used and intuitive to control a avatar or virtual character .
otherwise they went very quickly . and without a stable grid , it &apos;s not possible , so children die .
another statement of esther was that we react to a tragedy like haiti , but this is a kind of a science program .
it &apos;s produced by the malaria malaria system , and it &apos;s a very interesting kind of concept .
we have every street , every village , almost every square of madagascar .
in their business , a very cheap blue laser is a very cheaper computer .
audience : yes !
so , interestingly , although we have the whole time , we &apos;ve never done it , we &apos;ve never done it , the ham in the air .
this is the restaurant of acorn house .
this is the most important one that you see here , actually , grows in a very crude , which was made by the outside and the outside .
so , water is a very important aspect .
&quot; metal &quot; and &quot; earth &quot; is still out of .
the idea is not more sophisticated .
they don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
once it touches the water , you should hear how air comes out .
once we sequenced these two genomes , we asked ourselves : if this is the smallest genome of a different species , could it be even a smaller genome of it ?
moreover , we realized that once this worked , a real chance of exactly dignity would have , if we could get the synthetic chromosomes , it &apos;s the bacteria .
so care is a lot of time .
the last one is a quote by robert feynman : &quot; what i can &apos;t engineer myself , i can &apos;t understand . &quot;
but actually , we live in the northwest very close to the actual idea of paradise , the 36 times as gardens , which is a &quot; gardens , nomads through running streams . &quot;
but the more you add , the more you &apos;re lost .
and this number of 72 is never coming .
this is a nest of a wheels , and that &apos;s the nest entrance .
this is a colony that has been founded by a queen in the previous summer .
the most important thing -- that &apos;s a magnifying a magnifying a magnifying set -- you &apos;re going to go out early in the morning before the first group is a foraging group .
and curiously , and interestingly , it looks like it &apos;s just about half the ant colony just nothing .
the nest maintenance maintenance workers simply take all the peanuts and they put them into the edge of the sky and put them there .
the foragers are kind of deciding , not getting out .
and we did experiments that show that the longer ant is going to be a full ant out of the surface , the more the simple hydrocarbons in their surface change . so the ants smell different , that they do different work .
they &apos;re all going on the earth , except antarctica .
here you see that the cost of all of this is about 89 million barrels of oil , and the annual cost of three trillion dollars .
and we do that for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
it doesn &apos;t have to do anything with it .
i &apos;ve thought where we can use natural gas .
and when i was going to get into the most sustainable process , natural gas costs .
why don &apos;t you worry ?
so , they were just wiped out 500 million .
it was never called underwater , or something like that .
tbp : i lost 150 million in the wind , okay ?
some have 5,000 . many have more .
there was a lot of time . and there were a lot of plastic .
the life is a event . you get to be careful .
these are work in the lower manhattan , where you built the first ever estate .
these were maybe six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to that that thing the light bulb .
a friend of mine told me this story : the coming , didn &apos;t have to wait , but then the most important thing had to be , when they finally had there , to call them a number of people .
so sometimes i &apos;m going to use a rather clinical language , and it may not be so warm to you as warm as other talks about compassion .
and here &apos;s the basic idea that the idea of good did for people who are going to be able to get to be more good for it .
basically , if you &apos;re my enemy or my competitor , if you &apos;re not my friend or my family , i belong to a lot less , i &apos;m going to use a lot less to use the golden rule . okay .
so , the results are going to raise up . this is a zero-sum game .
every form of resilience , selection , forces one that recognizes humanity &apos;s humanity .
and they &apos;ll explain to you then , the other thinking that america doesn &apos;t want them to be respected and even in the way they want to dominate america .
most diseases are consistent with poverty , but in the case of cancer , kids seemed to die in cancer , mostly from wealthy families .
a week died a child died , but nothing changed .
because you just don &apos;t use this kind of energy and time , if it doesn &apos;t really care .
and so he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
well , the dominant news plan would say that there &apos;s a single oncogene in a single cell cell and that that makes you a more of a cancer of power .
what does that mean ?
we found a kind of a kind of conceptual material that contained the right extracellular matrix , we put the cells into the and lo , and in some four days , they were going to see the same thing , and on the right , they &apos;re going to see what we have in a culture .
and of course , we &apos;re asking , where are we going to go ?
and so i want to close with a poem .
we have a journalist journalist who was caught in the starfish ; a young girl , whose book is so many of the most powerful quotes , that you &apos;ve taken it out of the shelves ; a polish about fake times in the new york times .
it sounds a little bit like a curious book , but it &apos;s actually about new species of lying .
he wrote very , very positive reviews of himself . surprise !
you &apos;ve got four good friends to worship their personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can look at lying ; they were talking about it , and then they were left .
they told me how big the bath was , or they said , &quot; the most popular thing is , &quot; the hotel is so far away .
and a woman 2 : right there . okay , glass , do a picture !
and you want to get your eyes out .
but it really has my eyes open , how often i have left my life for emails , social networks and so on , even though there was nothing really important or a very important thing .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band of the rubber tape .
and everybody who &apos;s got a handle on it went back .
at least for me , because if i do the same thing , i &apos;m very , very boring , very boring . i &apos;m very quickly .
i see myself as -- i don &apos;t know what i see .
are you nervous , you know ?
im : do you worry ? you &apos;re looking at that sweet .
anyway , i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s good , but only that it &apos;s not harmful , ok ?
if you have the cream for too long , it becomes buttermilk .
i call it the era of citizenship -- which people are doing different species of species or ethnic populations , but as citizens , all the same things can be the same .
in egypt , i was discovered by the end of that .
this was in london , was trained in yemen , and in amsterdam , in amsterdam , a plane to attack america .
there &apos;s no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols that are using democratic culture on the ground .
as an anecdote , we can show that if poverty was the only factor , well , it &apos;s a business of the richest family , a great british family .
what happened there was a political coalition that was going to be a political coalition , and that was to remove the leaders .
these tools are only going to be interesting when they &apos;re becoming more complicated .
it &apos;s the limits of the individual networks and then it &apos;s a single set of networks .
and because of social networking , chinese students who studied in abroad , or companies from the rest of the world , had people in the world , there were people all over the world that they heard that news .
and finally , the chinese were born .
we are more in a media media in the media in the media , socially , ubiquitous , and cheap .
but all of a sudden , i &apos;m still going to think of it as i was going to do it .
in my fourth side side , a comet moved on the mountain , and it was a comet .
this view is up the air line . the first 600 feet of rise from base base base .
and that &apos;s in camp 4 .
and there were climbers on this summit ridge .
we also got the bad news that beck bacon , another climbers , collapsed in this storm , collapsed in the snow , died .
it &apos;s so thorny to work up , and i even have a lot of syringes on the top of the clothing .
this climbers was a lot of time .
and i can only alert it to how it did .
and so he &apos;s going to turn back to mind .
these are dogmas , the most prolific light .
and the fourth thing that &apos;s very significant for me is , &quot; ideas that we need to share with . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , by the rise of the rise , entrepreneurs became role models , and they &apos;re in great ways to society .
it was a lot of people who wanted democracy to bring democracy because they bring the ideas to the universal right , the universal , and the constitution and so on .
the third thing is again .
the second is the most important thing that we have , which makes it so hard to create the entrepreneurs that make it so hard to make jobs in companies in the world , 93 percent of the indian jobs are in the u.s.
so , if you &apos;re a young country , you have the chance to bring a modern social engineering , so you don &apos;t have the most important , if you &apos;re older .
you have to have a clear strategy , which is important for india and important to the world .
so the government decides to let the government vote again .
even though some people on the left don &apos;t like to hear it , it actually was the revolution of markets that gave the world &apos;s growth to the world , &quot; the government has no idea . &quot;
they fear the masses of it .
so this whole constructive mistrust between the food of the world and those who represent .
so , the main test .
every one of these transfers would be statistically captured for the most successful , two years after the world &apos;s office .
david cameron uses 20 million pounds in social media to be able to support this idea .
and the main change is investment in social change .

if you haven &apos;t found it , my name is tom thum and i &apos;m a full-time physicist , which means that i just heard you &apos;ve just heard what you &apos;re hearing , and just with my voice , just with my voice .
and lastly , with this one , i can do my hand , i can do my sounds , i &apos;ll repeat , repeat , repeat .
our people had to try and try and find about 5,000 different types of water , to find the right .
don &apos;t listen to those who say that you can &apos;t do that . everybody can do that .
on the right , a computer is a very high machine .
and i &apos;ll give you some examples .
you see the blue blue system .
his wife said it &apos;s &quot; the happiest day in your life . &quot;
many of these patients are moving the water lanes .
the results are better than the surgical .
he can stop the surgery anytime and immediately .
so , street street , i know .
and that &apos;s where you really get a lot of your creative inspiration , so it &apos;s a industry that goes both directions .
and so you want to go to the next trend and that &apos;s how fast you can .
and their jokes , like the most cosmopolitan of a football system , really works within this aesthetic .
you need a lot of lawyers and a lot of time in court , and the wages decided that it would be too expensive .
these are the two of these things in the logic of copyright protection in the logic of copyright protection .
and i really want to thank you to this point of engineering , which is that it made this very , very fierce presentation .
once i got a boat to a remote , and i realized that the menopause that i should meet was not to find out .
i think this is one of the most popular and more sophisticated things on the planet .
there are many ancient types of ancient ice groups on the e.u. , and if you &apos;re a little bit of a sudden , you &apos;ll notice that the most common ones were in front of the churches .
here &apos;s the most popular thing about the world &apos;s age of age .
i hope i find that i find these organisms , help to make them look at their remarkable , remarkable , spontaneous longevity , and keep my part of their own longevity in the near future .
let &apos;s put it on something else .
20 years later , criminals are still using mobile phones , but they also make their own software systems , like this one that &apos;s used by the most cosmopolitan in all 31 states .
what did they do with this ?
what could terrorists do today with the world now ?
the fbi recently arrested a military in the united states , which wanted to use these remote drones to transport the transportation of the u.s.
so , as we see here , we turn into universals .
now , the mortality rate is 70 percent , if you caught it , but that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s been killed so many people that the only way to get the only place of the funeral was not going to be a little bit of the same funeral in the way that this is outside of juarez juarez .
but on the other hand , i hear people talk about fear , a certain aversion before the risk .
and the very honest thing was , she was working in in colombia when she worked with the u &apos; 70s , with the goal of her culture and language , with two other colleagues from the farc of the farc and tortured and killed .
and there &apos;s no group that would be more susceptible to this kind of manipulation as young men .
patient capital is uncomfortable for people who are looking for simple solutions , lightly categories , because we don &apos;t look at profit as a mere instrument .
but the whole community , all different the different brain effects , the most common and more satisfying , would sit down and pray . &quot;
because when you stand in the juice , it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s green , it &apos;s feeding the world , it &apos;s enough to go into the sky . &quot;
but no faces ?
ok , let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
i tried to make a little joy of my wife .
why don &apos;t i do my wife , locally produced for my wife ?
but here &apos;s the problem . because a company is doing a body pad from cotton and it works .
spect rhino : i see this thing in my wife &apos;s hands , &quot; why do you use a bad pad ? &quot;
now , 110 countries can access them . okay ?
and it was so beautiful that i was over there in the last seven years .
then i did a huge amount of training . i swam down and forth .
it was actually happening that the cells in my fingers were going to be pulled into it and they &apos;re going to be doing it .
and my good friend david saw how i thought , and he came up and said , &quot; lewis , i know you , since you &apos;re 18 years old .
the prospect that you could be extinct in 30 , 40 years of extinction .
england , america , japan , south africa , congo .
it &apos;s about 380 trillion gallons of oil on earth today , which can be mapped and manipulated .
now this could be the end of the story -- okay , we just replace all of this with conventional , renewables -- but i think that the story is more than it &apos;s more than it .
very special material , the abalone shell itself , millions of abalone displays , the whole time , every single day .
and the idea of this was basically that i &apos;m the paintbrush in the hand of the great personalities , which come and i would interview .
but i wanted to have interviews that are different .
in fact , my first book was george abbott , the 97 years old , and the igbo was full of life forces -- i think you can define it .
we know the great world &apos;s big , we know the great moments , we know what we don &apos;t want to say , and the point of the thing is , nobody is ridiculous .
when we were alone , i was her audience .
it wasn &apos;t that kind of thing , but it was a very high for my conversation for my conversation .
he said , &quot; but i understand this . i can understand that . &quot;
half of the body was ill , the other one doesn &apos;t .
this is a non-zero-sum system in kathmandu , nepal .
i don &apos;t want to do a beautiful stuff .
there &apos;s a certain kind of treatment , it &apos;s called the &quot; name of &quot; .
it &apos;s not the painting that we would have painted , but what we actually made .
another example : a stupid mother .
thank you .
no , we &apos;re talking about 10 million , 20 million dollars on the swiss bank bank , on the bank bank in the bank of the president , the high clerks of the state of the state .
they actually get them to take them .
most of the big companies are now convinced that they need to be able to use very strict guidelines against bribes so on .
if you want to go to a restaurant , if you look at the menu , will you expect to make it all on the map ?
and that was the first time i thought that the expression on your face actually reflect what you &apos;re holding from him .
well , he shares his life .
this french painter of the 18th century was known for his life , but occasionally people are .
unfortunately , these tweets spend their most of the time with a series of other orphans in archive , and some of them are beautiful paintings .
the first time i was wearing it at a time of dinner , who gave us her parents to honor .
&quot; i &apos;m clapping to your own wedding , james .
my father was living most of his time in east africa .
i &apos;d like to show you six minutes .
so , the other thing , but our films , they &apos;re stories , they &apos;re stories with whom our people can identify .
so it &apos;s a young man out there to really get to what can be done , and it has to think about certain negative things , and all this , or any kind of , behave .
milgram &apos;s &quot; so much to say so much , so little time .
i think this is really the theme of this event .
milgram , you &apos;ve described this as a computer industry of the world .
it &apos;s basically a cd . it &apos;s a little bit of a plastic .
now the art critic . oh , that was fantastic .
that was really fantastic .
video games can be very profound , even though they &apos;re completely hostile .
we &apos;re showing &quot; portal , &quot; because you &apos;re shooting on walls to create new spaces .
so time , the aesthetic , and then the most important behavior , behave .
and i had to cut a few bridges down on the way .
everything refers to the most important and students who were in the first meeting that they were being rejected in a place .
so i made some sketches on napkins -- little boxes and things that i normally drew .
it &apos;s one of the most beautiful pieces i &apos;ve ever done .
this beautiful object , the swiss army army , for me , is going to be a participation .
and one day i had one -- oh , the other .
i &apos;ve got the most thin and copper , so it was very thin to be able to get it .
and that &apos;s my cafeteria .
and it reminded me about why i was doing things like this , and i &apos;m so eager to convey my house .
she never completed .
the dome was a wish of the brain .
it was a try , this little piece of land -- it &apos;s 30 miles in 75 feet -- into a unified field , by turning these areas separated and the local room in this pavilion , with a high space in it .
they call it &quot; a &quot; hallelujah &quot; .
here it is .
from the building in the background , it seems to be a motor iceberg in the mountains .
our clients don &apos;t want galleries , so -- and when we met our new autopsy , he said that this was the right shape .
in barcelona , i was asked to make a fish , we &apos;re working on the face of the computer , the way of the computer , the most cosmopolitan , and the street , and the street system .
can we make clean burning of it ?
and one of the things that they found was that they weren &apos;t burned .
and this is our main briquettes .
and he &apos;s been compared to the problem of health &apos;s activities and coal .
it &apos;s a place where , for example , india would have only three of us in this room , just three of us have a car .
so you can &apos;t use the same concepts like the united states in the united states to move the things forward .
there &apos;s a big difference .
after a surgery , everything is going to be .
now , this is not surprising . but we asked them to judge their honesty and intelligence , kindness and the other .
he married . he had a son called the &quot; name of &quot; a son .
is this business with our external and our employment with our own brain .
i want to tell you a little bit about the surgeries that we &apos;re doing , how far we &apos;re going to do and where we want .
we can replace the deforestation under the world &apos;s mri , but we &apos;re not very far in replacing with the loss of loss .
my theme is food in schools , because here &apos;s about social justice .
and the next one is the main line .
people are always talking about sustainability . but we should find out what that is at all .
you know , all of you think you have to have more and more food ?
and then they have a lot of time , hey , we can sell the stuff to kids .
and this is a typical standard of surgery .
the things that we might do at home , and so important , we have to teach kids to teach kids to schools .
we need to educate the employees .
this eight billion , by the way , means two dollars , 49 cents -- so much money is the government ready for lunch .
when a little girl was sitting in a hot school , my grandfather was standing out in the sun .
if i go to a party and ask people what i do , what i do , and i say , &quot; i &apos;m a professor , &quot; you will matt your eyes .
i want to know your favorite , everything about your own family , you know , you &apos;re a professional in things of your consciousness .
don &apos;t make the tension . i want to be a rather skeptical .
it &apos;s a documentary in a documentary in a field of consciousness .
when i came to , i expected to see all the details of most people , their clothes and so on .
how do you know that it was what they did ?
look at it ? who &apos;s not seeing it ? that &apos;s going to help .
we start to start with a few examples .
now , jeff hawkins has described his efforts to bring a good , big theory in neuroscience .
and the most popular in london said , &quot; what do you mean : &quot; who is in charge for london -- &quot; i mean , nobody &apos;s in charge .
now , congestion pricing were introduced in stockholm , january of january , 2006 , and the first picture here is a picture of stockholm , a typical road on january .
so , we did this enormous survey with lots of plastic and trying to figure out who changed and where they disappeared .
then i went to 20 years of school -- from eastern europe , in central asia -- through the mountains of the caucasus , southern europe , north africa , russia .
what do we know from the taliban &apos;s most important ones that are going to be used to the doors of people who are going to send their daughters to schools like in the street of the people ?
the world changed .
i was in my office , my desk was mesmerized , i had the blue air set on the walls .
and there were even two of them .
there was really what .
how amazing is this ?
now i &apos;m going to talk about some other patients , and i want to talk about some other patients in their power to improve health care .
and then i realized that i realized the page of google earth , where we can fly to each address .
we are the most an expert resource in health care .
the seawater of seawater is a giant one .
here &apos;s the resolution . a wonderful creature , right ?
they don &apos;t take their environment with the help of sound waves , and i &apos;m talking about the most important .
in the u.s. alone , the annual cost of the cost of the annual cost of the year is that bats are in a highly lethal number of dollars .
why should we deal with aging at all ?
if you &apos;re going to go out and look at the night sky and see this beautiful , flying animal , i wish you smile . thank you very much .
europe had to be in the economic development of the economy .
the boom of the raw materials pump up the water , but it &apos;s not all of the countries of the bottom billion .
so what &apos;s going wrong ? why is there that so-called &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; ... &quot;
and so countries of the bottom billion have a very profound policy .
a few economists just came in in time and said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try a auction ? you &apos;re going to reveal the value . &quot;
in this moment , on the world , there &apos;s a billion people in poor or poor countries , and how can we help them ? the economist paul collier provides a privilege to be compassionate , compassionate plan that we can end with the gap between arm and rich .
we don &apos;t have a container where they &apos;re made .
so he &apos;s teaching a english philosopher in africa in africa that takes a difference to the cause of the adult treatments .
so , we have this : imagine , you thought , you could take a lecture and you could talk to people in their native language .
&quot; basics of the brilliance surgery .
and i found for the first time 14 years ago , and i was going to be on this ordinary material , and it was used for centuries in the same way .
he asked me if i could build this as a piece of a piece of time for the city .
so we were experimenting with small plastic projects to create a dry fog that &apos;s shaped by wind , and it turns out that it can be shaped by people that are being shaped by people who can interact with it and move through , without becoming any more stupid .
they were in their own pocket in the grass , and they watched shifting patterns of the patient &apos;s brain , and they didn &apos;t know , and shared the wonders .
so , i also realized that this is a tremendous risk of our society .
when peter moves his arm , this yellow spot is the one that you see there , which is a place that &apos;s going to be able to get into the action of the brain .
if you do that , what are you going to do ?
and to say that changes also can be beyond death is even an claim about a fact that can be true or wrong .
now , let me ask you , what i &apos;m not saying , i don &apos;t say science is that this room can be able to be able to be able to have a science of science , or we will have scientific responses to each other .
now , why wouldn &apos;t this be synonymous with an objective morality ?
how high is that likely to be the probability of the human development ?
on the left , you see edward fermi &apos;s .
we live in a world full of solar technologies and these technologies can &apos;t be more easy to break it , it &apos;s always easier to break things together than they &apos;re going to get together .
but then we have to talk again about well-being in a larger context .
and what is his natural enemy , what the means of the good beetle , from the good beetle we talk about ?
she &apos;s a parasite , no , no , but a bamboo dictator , two mm long , lost , a quick and aggressive , a quick and aggressive .
and if we put these good ones into a computer , for example , they go to the flowers .
in israel , where we &apos;re on over 1,000 acres -- that &apos;s 10,000 israeli media industries -- biological pest mining associated with the power of oil , 75 percent of the pesticides were paid .
third , to raise consciousness for the potential of this kind of state .
and the most important one is one of my favorite things .
it &apos;s fun to make the fun fun , as it &apos;s about the more than about the oil level , and i do that often .
urban security , &quot; that &apos;s what new york needs . &quot;
her name was a little bit of a joke , and so that was -- i wasn &apos;t going to say enough to say , &quot; take the drawing . &quot;
or the collapse of the soviet union , only a few decades , perhaps within a decade , after the soviet union , was the soviet union .
because there &apos;s 80 percent out there , which really insects eat .
they &apos;re at the beginning of food food .
why do we actually do these balls in the soup , and it &apos;s still meat in it ?
it &apos;s 25 pounds per person per year .
so now we &apos;re deciding for one , or to five kilograms of output .
we can increase them a little bit on the expense of rainforests , but it &apos;s going to be a boundary soon .
and you might think , well , you &apos;re not available yet .
my three minutes didn &apos;t start , right ?
he said , &quot; ah , we have to put it on the table .
and i saw a sign .
even if canadian the system is going to do it , they do it in a way that is the society .
and in this book , the little lewis would find the big idea .
this is a very different one . and on the back , some other pieces of notes , and the other things , and scales to make some calculations . okay ?
right . so , this is how the device is going to use .
there &apos;s a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just amazing and remarkable .
so the first robot i want to talk about is called strider .
it &apos;s just used to show that if you have cameras or other sensors because it &apos;s high , it &apos;s a meter of 80 , you can get over obstacles , you can get over obstacles and the internet salad .
for example , in this case , although the left and the right wheel is connected to a single axis , and so quickly , it turns out to be a little bit more quickly .
welcome to the computer , the robot , the robot , the robot of virginia tech &apos;s tech tech . &quot;
but the cool thing about it is the user interface .
so , you see , it &apos;s going to be a first attempt . this was our first attempt , and ...
but what is the secret of our success ?
but only by a piece of imagination , to speak is not enough .
in this way , education is very important .
so , the more important thing to do is become a rescue .
there &apos;s basically no pool of good educators , and only eight percent of the county has a more threatening or higher degree .
there &apos;s a complete empty to the creative capital in bertie county .
the goal of the game is to have all the staff on the wheels , then there &apos;s a team won .
but in the last few decades , a lot of money was going to be that i was talking about for school camp .
and after the outside , the neighbors are going to interview what food they buy and where , and why , is a homework .
in this case , it &apos;s been impossible to create large cotton surfaces .
i want to invite you to follow my journey of the tv and explore .
after four months , it &apos;s coming out and now it &apos;s eight months away before it &apos;s going .
here &apos;s a couple of results .
this global act is going to lead to climate change , like fossil fuels , maybe even more than that .
when i learned about these two things , i think that was very , very , very , very personal for some of the personal reasons .
it has a very good job of science , which was partly part of the ronald mcdonald foundation .
and after treatment , we make a series of simple pieces of view of the child , to see how his vision is to fit .
the answer is in motion . i want to show you the next video .
i had to discuss a long time with my wife .
we &apos;re going to follow these research classes and hopefully have more results to report .
and then i have this kind of kind of high-tech advocate for physically disabled , and i thought , oh , i don &apos;t know , but before i &apos;m concerned about it , i look at how that is .
but that was in the fall of 95 , and then when the winter was getting down , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , aimee did it in the 1930s , and she &apos;s very excited . her family travels with -- it &apos;s a big thing .
i tried to do that , and i was able to get out of who , who &apos;s going to pass up , so who am i going to go to who i &apos;m going to do here ?
i had all won everything and now i thought , what ?
you can be a big deal . just take it away . &quot;
host and the designer will be at ted airways 2 , and we &apos;re going to talk about the design .
she got somebody who came over and the shoes came up .
but it &apos;s almost impossible to look at the actual losses of the economy , because we use math math .
or to the 11,000 jobs .
and something else about mathematics : math sometimes looks like math -- like in this example , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t -- how do i be drunk ?
in math education , we use about 80 percent of the time to teach people how to do three of hand .
if people ask me , is that true ?
but the robots in cars allowed it to separate these things , so that &apos;s what they &apos;re driving today than building a car and learning his head .
completely wrong .
but i think we can do both the same thing .
and one of the reasons why this is so important -- so it &apos;s very important , computers in the exams .
it was in winter 2009 , and i &apos;ve been blind for about a year .
i thought i was a particularly , very , father who was dead from complications of a surgical operation at the brain .
similarly , just by the handle of the ocean , the changing nature of the soil , and with time , a notion of where you &apos;re , and where you &apos;re , where you are , and what you &apos;re doing .
but when i was then , and then the broadway was going along , i was blessed to everybody .
if you design a city in the blind , it will be a lot of jobs , many jobs .
to give you a sense of this experience called &quot; i think you &apos;re free . &quot;
and the most famous thing that i knew -- the 10 commandments , love , love your next , is fertile and a silver thing .
you give money to a good purpose and developing emotional to the purpose of the purpose .
it &apos;s not a book written , and it &apos;s been written by the sky .
so , this is actually the key to me , to remember , to remember that there &apos;s no way to remember that on the way here , and i don &apos;t go up on the way to the steps .
so that was very inspiring to me .
so if we want to make a particular meaning of this book , we really need to rely on it , and with him calling up .
so we have this wonderful progress .
the academics that run this work would be to be able to do this , so we &apos;ve developed the applications of the way that the computer landscape of the computer is going to be a laser , in the laser , to the laser .
alex was working on a little , obscure , independent , independent , with the name &quot; minority report &quot; for steven spielberg , and invited us to develop the interface that &apos;s going to be used in the movie .
we &apos;re going to take this double operation through because we like yellow and we like to be yellow in green .
let &apos;s pull that apart : i &apos;m bringing it into a museum of water .
we , as people , are the ones that make things and we should make sure that our machines are helping us to help us build and build on it .
john , thank you for reality to reality .
what okolloh did was not possible without digital technologies .
but here &apos;s the point . the most creative act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that are represented by this black line said , &quot; we change this agreement immediately .
they &apos;re created by the members of the community for each other .
and how all good news companies do they do is a leap of 20 years when the interest of the audience changes .
you don &apos;t always have five days available . so changes and we started playing pizza .
but india didn &apos;t want to play in the office game .
the other was indian cricket .
it was the new india ? that was another world where you could get players from all over the long price , as long as you got the best player to be .
we &apos;ve all had games in calcutta , but we &apos;ve never seen this before , and it &apos;s been the case of the audience , and it was a song that was a song with a computer song , for calcutta , not for the india , but for calcutta .
could you imagine that this day would come ?
hopefully i &apos;ve made a lot of them to make a experience and the game more popular and hopefully , and hopefully there &apos;s a longer time to work in this business .
and you know that the answer is dogs because they have a little bit of memory in memory , like often they saw dogs and pigs on the rope .
why about everything in the world should play every lottery ?
on the other hand , if you go to a developing country , and buy a $ 25 dollar system , it &apos;s a big mac for a big mac .
would you spend your remaining 20 dollars for a ticket ?
i &apos;ll give you an example .
and if the way to the other end of the city is 100 bucks , it &apos;s worth 100 bucks , completely no matter where they &apos;re saved , but people don &apos;t think that way .
well , in the big and all of the time , you &apos;re enormous .
watch what happens when we parked a car &apos;s license .
dan , i &apos;d like to hear more . so , you say our answer is to terrorism , i mean , that he &apos;s a kind of mental error ?
there &apos;s no guns .
and so some people look at economists as dumb people .
and the subject and variation is one of these most intellectual , which requires a certain intellectual activity , because you always compare the variation to the subject that you have in mind .
&quot; in words , in fashion , the same rule is so fantastic when to be too awesome or too old , or not the first thing that was going to be the old one , the old one is the old one . &quot;
and i woke up one day and said , &quot; well , maybe that &apos;s not ? &quot;
first , my willingness to give me a critical audience without suggesting i &apos;m sure i &apos;m sure .
it &apos;s my intention to go to the poster , and it &apos;s not going to be understood .
so , in the big and all of our food .
jews often have a uncomfortable smell of smell .
if the space was flooded , we could see that people are passing more negative attitudes to gay men .
it &apos;s as if i was going to talk about what i &apos;ve done in this 20 years .
it feeds my mind and my soul .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends , other filmmakers , and they talk about what cinema means .
without food , i became sick .
we don &apos;t need any more trouble to get the idiots out !
our government was corrupt .
so for me , the idea that we have all these kids , it &apos;s a generation , we have a generation of children , which was so psychological , and they had to go through that much psychological trauma or harm and have to live .
through the whole book , they go through a more hour of a hour of a hour of interactive animations and interactive animations .
what &apos;s the business ?
at least it seemed like you &apos;re going to be , and still , you know , still true .
so i thought , &quot; yes , that &apos;s a good idea . &quot;
the talk still is about this .
when i came from college , i worked in southern california , and you &apos;re working on the spanish , and you &apos;re going to the spanish , and these things .
rsw : how does his schedule look like ?
the main thing -- they &apos;ve interviewed me for this with interviewed and sent their technical design to bilbao .
that &apos;s what reminded me .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; so what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
if you walk with three months , the ideas are going to be more clear and more and more useful .
and one thing i wanted to mention at my favorite time , but somehow , it was , all companies who helped me to start with it .
but in the meantime , these things win momentum .
and this is 10 weeks later , from hand , hand .
you see the suits , the color of the fish .
the cortisol on non-zero-sum games and things is remarkable , and this is what the most important thing is to do .
it &apos;s an incredible endeavor , 15,000 workers , i believe , five domes and the sixth of this .
this level is working on 1,500 workers .
50 percent of the computer land on the world to recycling in china .
it was quite unusual , so stefan , that less than five percent of advertising had a picture .
and wish three is : the first thing i &apos;ve been saying is , i was going to do a thing , and i always wanted to be in this way .
and it &apos;s increasingly more important that we can find out how we can gain these kinds of materials from these extremely complex .
the traditional ways to separate material , it doesn &apos;t work for plastics .
the traditional way to make it is to make oil or petrochemicals .
at the end of this process , we have a mixed user system : many different kinds of plastic and many different qualities of plastic .
now i see a lot of the data out there .
and what we see is that people tend to commit mistakes to the same kind of same way again and again .
maybe we should study how monkeys make economic decisions and figure out whether they do the same stupid way as we do .
here &apos;s overreaction . it &apos;s going to trade a token against food and wait happy , and gets your food .
you &apos;re waiting for a little impatient to open the market .
now imagine that i &apos;m going to push every 1,000 of you into your hand -- so 10 , a hundred , hundred dollars of notes .
you can either choose a loss of loss -- so i throw a coin . you &apos;re going to be really losing a coin .
if we made the same scenarios in our little brain systems , they would do the same things like the people ?
the person on the left is a safer loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just people on the last stage of development , making dumb mistakes .
and that &apos;s the catch .
but if we think about buildings , they &apos;re mostly only four stories tall .
we need to have less with concrete and steel and we have to build higher . in recent times , we &apos;ve been working on the street .
this is as much as we have spent 900 cars in a year of 900 cars .
so , the curtains of derartu curtains .
maybe even &quot; citizens &quot; , because recently they were up to fight the status of law , the citizens of the media work together to help each other .
and the largest , the largest and oldest bank in russia , largely in the russian government , now , to locate employees and citizens in the development of innovation with innovation .
we &apos;ve heard about ted on ted , who have been hacked with the plants who have the plants with anna , and they &apos;re working on the world , to create a young people , making websites and turn videos .
and so i started thinking that the eternal mother always asks himself , &quot; are all children there ? &quot;
that &apos;s compassion .
he asked her to convey a message , and all of them read in their own language , a central version of the golden rule , &quot; what you don &apos;t want to do , the most appropriate thing to do , &quot; the most impossible to do it . &quot;
being a pastor means to take care of these individual needs .
and we do this by some of the things .
there &apos;s 180 messages in washington d.c.
it &apos;s already taken by parks and sculptures .
it &apos;s made of a fiber fiber .
there &apos;s also some constraints on its lighting .
the bubble is a giant one .
i saw aunt raped when i was just five .
one of the things i experienced when i was trying to eat my friend , because we didn &apos;t have food and we were around the 400 .
as a child , as young as a child , i can &apos;t forget that , not forget .
this is my story , shared in the form of a lesson / memory .
my breakfast , my lunch , i &apos;m going to a foundation that i started to build , because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give the farmers tools .
audience : yes !
the third chapter is a more complicated thing called &quot; government &apos;s appeal &quot; to the world .
that means more than 60 percent are for it .
we &apos;re going to solve this task by expanding the problem of death penalty .
and even if that happens , it &apos;s not too late .
i remember nothing from time when i was five years old .
santa claus knows whether to be good or not . right ? &quot;
but julie , you were ready for school . you were so ready . &quot;
they looked at each other and smiles , in the sense , that was the right answer . then they kept saying , &quot; do you think we all are brothers and sisters on this earth ? &quot;
maybe your bigger ability to cooperate and adapt ?
i think this film shows the toughest look at the modern times .
in world war ii , we had to produce a lot of stuff .
but we cannot forget that it needs a fundamental contribution , and that &apos;s how many resources of the planet we use .
but now the good news !
it &apos;s perhaps in latin america .
and at that point , the skeptics and the climate change of climate change in the world .
we did a project for a few years ago , a big program , it was called , the most important thing -- many experts -- many experts were involved -- all of the evidence -- a strong amount of noise .
a group of people who are asking them to spend it for themselves and to spend the other group of people .
when they went from the first building to the second building , all of them went to a man who &apos;s leaning on and they would be clear , and clearly help , and the question needed to be , did they think and helped ?
the word is &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; car &quot; and &quot; the &quot; road &quot;
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &#91; unclear &#93; : the hidden life is beautiful things .
since -- now , it &apos;s four decades -- i &apos;ve been trained with the best in this area , had a young group , and i &apos;ve been teaching young and old , created , and i created a rich net of art , successes and awards .
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my real life force .
i dance between the computer and the most motivated and i was trying to adapt this to my favorite .
well , it was basically frustration .
that &apos;s how it was at the time .
he put them together , combined to put this into something called a little bit of a little bit of a sudden , and then he gave them this software , from which i think they had developed his son , and he made this wonderful presentation .
there are little kinds of things in these documents , little boxes .
i want to suggest -- yeah , do you make a nice website . how could i say , you don &apos;t have to make a beautiful website ?
now you ask the linked data that you &apos;ve put together now , 32 hits , which everyone is a protein with these properties and you can look at them .
and that &apos;s what linked data is about .
all this will be a year that every year , two million children die less , in the last year , than in 2000 .
and if it &apos;s so , we &apos;re ready to collect feedback and give up to make sure that the promise really provide outcomes ?
you just show one of the numbers there , 5,000 -- is that the number ?
my brothers started to draw sticks and paint .
that &apos;s what fascinated me to explore this area .
how many of you have a cow on the street on the road from bangalore to mysore ?
it &apos;s just that we &apos;re trained to be a human being , and the reality is that we do .
and they said , &quot; okay .
can &apos;t you do anything , you &apos;re artists ? &quot;
this is a box of plastic tubes .
because if we see somebody run by , we see the footprint .
what percentage of these have the foreign media system ?
obviously he has sat in a cave over the last 20,000 years .
so the foreign development is really beautifully suited to coming up , because -- if you think about it , i &apos;ve been invited to be invited to discuss today about economists that are very , very much more powerful .
this is the place i showed you at the beginning .
we &apos;re going to do something technical now .
think of toyota .
you can &apos;t do it against the gun , so you accept it and you find a way to work .
it &apos;s very hard to vote .
it &apos;s a lot of the time .
pizza is taking them when they have hunger .
there are millions of different types of water .
so remember , if we think about sexual education and activities , they are out of baseball .
it &apos;s the poet chen , and it &apos;s like , &quot; i can &apos;t bear the world &apos;s most , the most important thing .
and that &apos;s , &quot; how much percent of the day you think that person ? &quot;
in over the last ages , people have been leaving these online structures of the brain structure .
they came home with a little bit of blood ships .
and it really became a strong force .
and i said , &quot; why do you think men are women &apos;s women ? &quot;
no time in this was the women who were so educated , so interesting , so that they could .
she &apos;s 23 she was taken her for 13 .
i started to get to the other , why you &apos;re in love with a person in love with the other .
they &apos;re going to be as long as the human race is on what shakespeare called &quot; these sins . &quot;
but unfortunately , i know it .
most researchers believe that obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
maybe we should ask ourselves whether it could be that the resistance of weight and energy disease is the cause of weight and environmental disease -- at least most people ?
other people , it &apos;s too much .
peter ornish : what if our views were wrong ?
my great henry ford , henry ford , really believed that the mission of ford was the person who &apos;s making the lives of people and make cars affordable for everyone .
and the good news is that today we &apos;re going to be the big problems of cars and environment -- not just at ford , but in total as industry .
i think you can imagine it already .
but what really inspired me is the possibilities that we &apos;re going to be able to communicate when our cars are starting to communicate with each other .
we need a infrastructure that is able to support this flexible future .
this is a minute 59 .
i think now my mother , i &apos;m like a kind of a kind of a kind of a design model .
the nurses have to go on data .
this is really important . it &apos;s a lot . &quot;
so what &apos;s going on ?
and for us , it was great , because we won a lot of prizes .
i was infected when i was 17 , then when a student was a student , i came to adults who really believed my ideas , and i would drink a lot of the other things to me .
now it &apos;s all about the kids . so we don &apos;t .
basically , we gave the kids a simple task .
for our auction , we have some wonderful images for them , for a really good purpose , which is the money that they give us , to buy hearing hearing .
but what i never said , and what i want to do is that the fact that it &apos;s cool is that it &apos;s cool .
in a way , in a way , in the elegant or more accessible product , there &apos;s a product that we have , the most different , the most different of development , the most different kind of development -- and inspired by the incredible way of experiencing experience .
if you think about the change in our society , the most powerful from the country in the cities , the two years , the same process happens in 20 years .
it looked ahead , even though these were unknown .
so , for example , we would put the models under an artificial sky .
i think a reduction in the height of 94 percent is almost in .
and how do we do something more like this in the developing world , especially in some places i &apos;m talking about -- china for example , that &apos;s going to build 400 new airports in the next 10 years .
and this is the focus of the speech talk -- there &apos;s no lighting in the positive sense that &apos;s healthy and our well-being is not providing the absence of darkness .
unlike the first office , i showed you the beginning of the talk , this is a very well-known office , which is the most popular office .
behind you see the building building , the following building that became a symbol of modern technology .
i think what you &apos;re seeing here is right here -- how much light in the sky is falling and never reached the ground .
this is not very pleasant and more satisfying .
they &apos;re not going to be disturbed anymore .
if our business system , like some weeks ago , was interviewing a war in a third of india , called about 200 , the most powerful , it &apos;s a subject .
and one day -- i don &apos;t know what happened -- while i was going home from the office , i might see a bee , or it came to me in the sense : could i be like a bee , would be wonderful .
anil gupta : but what &apos;s it going to use ? what was it going to be used ?
to do what to do ? to dig stones , to dig .
this is the only place where you could express your creativity .
they don &apos;t want a second choice of standards and the more sophisticated .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s made of the brain &apos;s brain technology .
i had to be my favorite .
mr. ebert , who lives with a physical challenge , only 50 inches tall .
it &apos;s a giant , long-distance diet .
this is a lot of the time .
these are 3.2 billion people .
or ski . it just makes fun and the people love it and doing fun things .
so we have very , very hard , but we knew that it wasn &apos;t so hard to develop the technology like acceptance about what &apos;s important and how technology can be used .
cars are not made for it by side-by-side , and it &apos;s wonderful to go with them with them and drive them from the city , but think about it : we &apos;ve got all the problems in terms of range and speed .
so if we could add this box here , we could have a solution to the transportation , electricity , and communication , and maybe drinking water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 kilograms ?
and embracing , or explicitly , recognized that people who are dying in the drugs are actually involved in the drug budget . we take the fact that they were either tortured or professional or even both .
los zetas , when a bond &apos;s a bond , the fear of psychopaths , and the press is spreading and bring the press to the silence , and that &apos;s true to most of them .
mexico and the u.s. , now on a truly international organization , is to change partnerships with production in the south and global partnerships in global distribution .
but also , a month of being three-dimensional magazine -- you live in the future , and we have a long time of time .
and after you &apos;re going to be a critical price , it tends to be successful , you have a critical mass of mass , a breakthrough .
but they &apos;re going to be very , very cheap , and look at the interesting effects . if you &apos;re cheaper , the brands , the credit and so , the food , the food , they win , they win .
if you look at linux , linux is in red , it reaches 20 percent .
&quot; open accessible &quot; is really , you know , the gift of silicon design in the world .
because of some of the technologies we talked about .
patient capital works between the best one , trying to take the best out of both .
the second thing to do is very cheap .
president obama understands this .
because one of the poorest farmers in the world had found access to a technology that has enabled him to change his life .
and yet , this is exactly the properties of the men and women being honored by all generations .
they remember , while the most popular in the blog was the most educated , in his blog , they were often able to do it , and it was just possible because blogs are easily available .
i like music , and i like to do a lot of music , and i think i heard steve martin games and i said , &quot; i can also . &quot;
i wrote this post , and i &apos;ve taken this because of einstein today .
and you see this post .
these little things are happening .
and maybe i have to get a lot of time because i &apos;m talking about it .
it was been recovered for typically , except from our generation .
we need to use this process immediately to get a better understanding of the ocean .
we studied these fish curious , but we had to learn how to keep them .
but it &apos;s only half the size of the largest tuna we &apos;ve ever tagged .
they come together . that could be sex under tunas , and there &apos;s .
you can put a lure on -- it &apos;s a seal like a seal -- and a white shark will go to the end of a very close creature that comes out of the 16 foot .
and then we give these animals a encore by helping us .
and the white shark .
i think he didn &apos;t think that the records of my favorite players were so accurate .
they said , &quot; aside , what we &apos;ve talked about , are you in groups that want to harm the u.s. ? &quot;

now , who &apos;s looking at my favorite , i see that i was there , and i know that i was in the ninth of may for dollars in the safeway .
all of these moments i &apos;m going to push a computer on my life .
when i started with the project , people said , &quot; why would you say , &quot; why would you all say , what you &apos;re doing ?
now it &apos;s quite normal .
now , look at this , please , this sort of thing of paris , to see how incredible the growth is .
i looked at thousands of these organs , and trust and efficiency are always very different elements .
how do we copy how trust from face to face ?
i was kind of a spirit in the system .
this page is going to be a day of a day , and 80 percent of it gets a precise answer .
i want to start with a paradox .
and here you see it in relation to inequality , which i &apos;ve shown you , which i &apos;m going to get back to .
first with the rich , developed countries , and then in a second , more than 50 american states -- the same question : cut the more unequal states on all of these scales ?
with devastating effects , what the use of talent is about .
and in our analysis , we find the same contrast .
the social judgments are taking judgments , and fear of those judges .
or for example , why violence in more unequal societies is more likely to be more sensitive to people , because people are sensitive to being unchanged .
a year , more than three million microbloggers , a new knee or a new knee .
you remember , &quot; kamal &quot; before the day was the most popular .
if you wear it under pants or rock , or a sari , it &apos;s very clear that you &apos;re wearing a prosthetic , and in societies where disability is a social stigma , people are very sensitive to people .
so thank you very much .
you want a dirty magazine ?
i even bought the most popular thing . there &apos;s a little piece of paper that says , &quot; use this kind of thing , &quot; not to get juice to the closed .
this is the results one to the 20th : &quot; google just , &quot; just like , &quot; oh , &quot; so , &quot; the &quot; oh &quot; so many of the &quot; o pages &quot; is .
strong fear is inevitable .
but if you &apos;re always in this condition , the work would never be done , because you would say , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve found a new way to make it . &quot;
almost everything we do is subconscious .
it &apos;s about being safe in this world .
if the theme park is rusty and would fall apart , they would never go a ride .
it &apos;s a very small sample -- you should not be averse to the results .
i &apos;m going to talk about kids and self-organization and a series of experiments that would have been able to look at me as an alternative education .
and the night of this day , 70 children in the internet .
so i could even choose to pick up a cross-section of a cross-section , which represents the whole world .
what you &apos;re looking at is , because there &apos;s a child using the computer .
natural systems are all self-organization : galaxies , molecules , cells , organisms , organisms , societies -- except the discussion of the theory of intelligent designer .
and it &apos;s about to get to get the oddities of idealism in this whole area .
i bought a nice suit and i took shoes with a nice suit , and i was drawn to this remarkable access that i had to go to .

this is the 21st century , and in a certain sense , independent diplomat is that this is the climate change , this change , which is happening with us all .
&quot; hey , could you get me more involved ? &quot;
because if we go back to the world &apos;s office , they understood that a simple mistake can say what you &apos;re not , or you can remember why you love something .
we feel awe , pity .
go ahead .

no . in the &apos; 70s , the transcendent show , &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; s , &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; and &quot; three angels for charlie . &quot;

and i &apos;m very excited about talking about you , i &apos;m going to go and say , &quot; can somebody tell me the basic thing , and why is that cool ? &quot;
next , this dna virus produces this dna virus that covers bacteria .
from a series of reasons .
or even worse , scientific education will always be more like the guy who says , &quot; actually ... &quot;
but we have a lot of work in front of us and if someone is involved in science , please , i &apos;m going to leave you with me .
we &apos;re going up the staircase and we find a state of consciousness .
