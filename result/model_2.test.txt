you know , one of the great big things that travel and one of the pleasures in the research research is to live with people who remember the old days , and they still feel the old ones that are still going to feel the old days , they &apos;re touching the bitter leaves .
just knowing that the whole thing that &apos;s going to travel beyond the milky milky way , or the purpose of the oldest of the inuit , are still full of meaning , or that in the himalayas , the buddhist is still the breath of the world &apos;s own , which is , even successfully , the world &apos;s own , is that the world is , even successfully , a whole way of being found in the world , which is even successful , a group of certain ways of adaptation to our ancestors , even successfully .
and of course , we all share the same thing .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing kids to the world .
we &apos;re walking through the road .
we have to deal with the hottest separation of death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dance and art .
but interesting , the unique tone of the brain &apos;s unique , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the most important in the forests of borneo , or the warrior in haiti , or the warrior in the world &apos;s office , or the warrior in the middle of the world , or a , in the middle of the world , is the one that i traveled to a month in the desert , or even a more of the time that i &apos;ve been traveling in the desert .
all these people teach us that it &apos;s other people thinking other ways to think other ways to make the way to make the ground on earth .
and that &apos;s an idea that , if you think about it , only to make hope .
together , the myriad cultures of the world are forming a net from a network of water and cultural life that the earth is going to be doing and the most important thing that the earth is as important as the biological engineering system , which you know as a biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural pulse of culture as a solar system , and it can be the most important thing that the most important and dreams , myths , ideas , inspiring and intuitions that have been generated by the human imagination .
the most amazing legacy is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we &apos;re , and what we &apos;re capable of as amazing species of species .
and as the biosphere was completely wiped out , this was happening with the most powerful speed .
no biologist would say for example that 50 percent or more of all species are just about extinction , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet , this -- the most important thing to do on the field of biological diversity is almost what &apos;s known as a foreign scientist on the site of cultural diversity .
and the key indicator of this is extinct .
when everyone was born in this room , 6,000 languages were spoken in the earth .
now , a language is not just the full of the vocabulary or a series of a series of people .
a language is expression of human mind .
it &apos;s a means that &apos;s going to have access to the soul of a particular culture to find the material world .
every language is like a forest of the mind , a turning point , a thought , a ecosystem , a ecosystem , a moral ecosystem .
and from these 6,000 languages today , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , it &apos;s not a half to the ears of children .
they won &apos;t teach the infants anymore , which means that if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely than being the silence of the silence , one of the last of your people who speak your language , no way to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or to expect the hope to expect children ?
and yet , this terrible fate is actually something that &apos;s happening anywhere on earth , about all two weeks , because all two weeks , a elderly , and takes the last bit of a old language to the grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; it &apos;s not better ? &quot; it wouldn &apos;t be a better place if we all would speak a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s say this language &apos;s shy . let &apos;s be a little bit of a basketball language .
let &apos;s be pachycephalosaurus . &quot;
and then you would suddenly recognize how it would be if you could not speak your own language .
so i want to take you in a way to take a journey through the world &apos;s journey , a short journey through the brain &apos;s test , to try to understand them , to make them understand what &apos;s actually lost .
now there are some of us who are in a way that i say , if i say , &quot; different ways of being , &quot; really different ways of being .
for example , take this child of the northeast of the amazon in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the people who believe they &apos;re going to be the most powerful from the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
this is a people who are not cognitively , in between the colors , and green , because the most expensive thing that the forest is dependent on is the forest .
they have a strange language , and a computer company called the linguistic water industry : you have to marry somebody who &apos;s talking a different language .
all of this is driving in the multiplicity of the multiplicity of the very awkward houses , which is the strange house that &apos;s about the most powerful , or seven languages , but that &apos;s that you &apos;re never going to hear somebody who learns a language .
you just hear about it and you start talking .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes i &apos;ve ever lived in the northeast of ecuador , the most amazing people in the northeast of ecuador , was an amazing people who was first bathed in 1958 .
in 1957 , five forgery tried to touch and make a more transformative mistake .
they threw these scores down from the air , which we would be as friendly as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people were never seen a little bit more mature in their lives .
they took these photographs from the forest forest , trying to see behind the face or the character , and they found that this business business of devil war was killing the death of devil and killing five confidence with the spear .
but the most important thing was not just killing the outside of the spear .
they &apos;re going to be a different one .
54 percent of the deaths happened by the u.s.
we &apos;ve been doing the eight generations back and found two cases of a natural death and when we were doing the people with a tragic thing about it , they gave that one of the people was so old that he died as a tenth of his age and we killed him with the spear .
but at the same time , they had a clear idea of the forest that was amazing .
their hunters could smell the urine of a different animal , distance , and determine what animal animals of this state was .
in the early world , i got a really amazing task when my professor was asked to go to harvard , if i was interested in walking to haiti and to infiltrate the secret societies that were the foundation of the strength and the poison that was used to make a difference for making a difference .
to give this sense of a sense of a sense , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of the design of the world &apos;s knowledge and voodoo is not a cult of the black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex template .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked them , the great world world world world &apos;s great world &apos;s world would say what they would say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , a , whatever .
a continent will always leave out , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious belief , of course , and there was just a little bit of the hyperbole of this very profound religious thought that &apos;s the tragic muslim thought that &apos;s the tragic muslim thing .
but what &apos;s interesting about this is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living bear gives you the spirits .
the minds can be used by the big water , answers to the rhythm of dance , to be buried in the spirit of the living , so that the most subtle moment for a short kind of light will become the god .
the word of the computer is like , &quot; your white is going to church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and will be in god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the mind , you &apos;re going to get out of the mind . how can you get damage ?
look at this amazing demonstrations : the most red of a computer , the red coal without combustion , an amazing graph of the ability to influence the body that this is a very powerful measure of the spirit that it &apos;s going to be a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all people i met , the kogi from the sierra nevada de francisco was santa leone in southern kenya , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the old industrial civilization that the caribbean protected the caribbean of colombia and the following of the railroad was moved to a massive massive , massive , which is going on to the caribbean in the jungle .
in a very crude continent , these people were the only ones that never had been conquered by the most .
until today , you &apos;re being elected by a ritual priesthood , and the education is a very extraordinary priesthood .
the young people are separated in the age of three and four years of their families , and in a world contract of darkness , in the base of the glacier for 18 years , two times , for 18 years , the nine months of pregnancy , they have been able to mimic the people &apos; lap , they spend the most nine months of pregnancy , they spend the most nine months of pregnancy .
and during this whole time , they &apos;re being introduced to the values of their society , values that maintain the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- is free to maintain the inner -- balance .
at the end of this amazing industrial system , they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , in the age of 18 years , you see a sunrise , and in this very troubled moment of consciousness , when the sun starts to get the amazing beautiful landscape , suddenly everything you &apos;ve told me is what i &apos;ve told you about .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you need to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers for the destruction of the world .
now the intuition of intuition is very important .
whenever we think about the native and landscape , we either have a little bit of the same , and the old kind of the fancy wild of the fancy wild , which is a very fond thought in his biology , or a comment , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
so , native americans are not sentimental , they &apos;re going to be a monopoly .
it doesn &apos;t have much space to be in the world &apos;s office of the world &apos;s cold , or the cold winds of tibet , but they &apos;re still shaped by time and ritual , and the fact that the earth is shaped in the world , which is not based on the idea , but in a very subtle intuition , the idea that the earth can only exist because it &apos;s in the human mind .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a small child from the andean , which grows to the belief that the mountain is a giant , which is the way that the mountain will determine or determine your fate , will be a very different person , and a different relationship to this resource , which is growing up , that a mountain is a bunch of rocks that can be erased .
whether he &apos;s a shocker of a spirit or a bunch of light , irrelevant is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the nature .
i grew up in the woods of british colombia and believed that these forests are going to be , to become more educated .
this made me a different person than my friends under the village , who believe that these forests of the blade of the proton and the curved spirits are the kind of the melting of the world &apos;s brain , minds that are going to live in their own business .
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is a lot of the most powerful , which is the most powerful , the most powerful , of course , the body &apos;s body .
what makes it fascinating is not just the potential potential of this system , but it &apos;s going to be made out of two different sources of information , and on one side , there &apos;s this wooden water , which is a series of plastic , which is a series of a series of plastic , but it &apos;s going to be a little bit like a blue ball of a smoke , but it &apos;s about the petals of a family of the family &apos;s name , but it &apos;s about the petals of a family of the
this plant contains some very strong amounts of water that serotonin , and the water system , and the very similar thing .
if you &apos;ve seen the most popular , you &apos;ve seen this stuff that you have to make this substance that you made from different species , also , to make it a lot of different forms of information .
this powder is about to be a kind of like a cotton shot , and the way of being a little bit of a sudden , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to create a bias of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have my professor , richard evan , who &apos;s the man who &apos;s been performing the magic of the magic mushrooms with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico , and i said that , i said you don &apos;t know that you could be able to see the same thing as a coach .
but the thing with the design of the brain is that they can &apos;t be taken out of the way , because they &apos;re in the human gut of course , by name , of course , to be a name of the sun .
you can only get rid of some other chemicals that mao fry is taken .
now the fascinating thing is that the most amazing ones that contain the most important ones in the field of the world are the same as the way they &apos;re necessary to get the power of the world . so ask yourself .
how can these people be made from an icy species of 80,000 species , which are not going to find these two extra plants , which , if they combine this way , is a kind of a kind of a kind of , kind of , that is a kind of larger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trying and error , which turns out , as meaningless .
but you ask the indians , you say , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the most 17 varieties of people that you see in the forest , you know , in the forest that you see in the forest , as a kind of thing .
and then you ask them how they were going to justify their own and they say , &quot; i thought you &apos;d understand something about plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that every 17 varieties of food in the world , you &apos;re going to take a breath in a different way .
now , this is not going to give you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting the street .
now , the problem is that even the problem that even among us , the sympathy of the hard possible situation , is the native , and as a result , you look at the past , but the way that the real world , but the real world , is that our world , is accelerating .
so , in fact , you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century , in 300 years , for his wars , or technical innovations , but rather than an era where we were in the world , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth either actively supported the change . so the problem is not change .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new health tools .
and the problem is not the technology .
the most important thing to be heard is not to be less on sioux than they stopped and arrow , when americans stopped being americans when they stopped the horse and the other tasks .
not change and technology is contributing the integrity of the most cosmopolitan . it &apos;s power . ugly face of the rule .
and wherever you &apos;re in the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures are not the fall of the bottom , which is being emitted by its existence of the intent , which is being emitted by the capacity of interdependence , which is the most powerful thing to be able to do , and the most powerful , in the world &apos;s water , which is a very , very half of the water , which is a very , very prolific , and the most prolific , where the japanese is being emitted to the
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m going to work a lot , you &apos;ll see ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the emergency risk of people , generally , is convicted of people , but the most expensive , the destruction of the lifestyle of people , not only not not not only is being convicted , but generally , as part of a computer of a football system .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of starvation if you haven &apos;t experienced it on the top of the ground .
i was once traveling with a young colleagues , 6,000 miles of pac-man in the suburbs , and only as i came to auschwitz , and i was looking at the face of the statistics that were being killed by the statistics of the people who were murdered in the world &apos;s cultural revolution .
the father of this young girl was identified as followers of the railroad lama .
that meant that he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle fled her holiness with her holiness , people brought to nepal .
his mother was locked in , when punishment was a punishment for -- to be a crime .
he was imprisoned in the prison of two years to hide under her own family , because she couldn &apos;t live .
the sister who did that , they were killed in a very , very skilled .
one day she came out of a snake , and she had to put her for a few years into a heavy labor shop .
the suffering of starvation can be pachycephalosaurus , but the brain &apos;s mind is something that is a little bit more mature .
and at the end of that , we really have a choice . do we want to live in a world of the world &apos;s world , or in a world of diversity , in a world of diversity ?
margaret dunbar , the great anthropologist before she died that it &apos;s her greatest fear that as we move towards a thread , we &apos;re going to be able to move out of the whole range of human imagination on a very different way , but that we have to wake up one day from a dream , and we have forgotten that there was ever other possibilities .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species have been in 600,000 years .
the main revolution that brought us to agriculture , and we &apos;re in this moment the cult of the ted system , the poetry of the dolphin &apos;s poetry , and the hierarchy of the priesthood , and the hierarchy of the priesthood , created specialization just 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world like we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we &apos;re going to be in the next millennia .
if we ask these 4,000 environmental rights problems to the meaning of the human questions , they &apos;re going to answer 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we will bring the possibility to be able to be able to be able to be conscious , people who are aware of the importance that all people and gardens have to be able to flourish , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took on the northern end of the mountain , when i went to the most cosmopolitan , and this man , a great story , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the eastern government is not always very good with the inuit and the most prolific years of the world &apos;s population , they were forced to pull up , to pull in settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit don &apos;t have fear before the cold , they used them to their advantage .
the most popular of her sledge were originally made of fish , which was made in the street of the fish .
the guy of man was not worried about the arctic night or the light storm .
he was looking outside , and he took his pants out of the side , and he had a little bit of a drag down in his hand , and when the feces started to overcome it , he shaped her in the shape of a enjoyed .
he &apos;s got a little bit of the head of the head of the mountain and when it was completely frozen , he was a dog with it .
he &apos;s got the dog and he threw a thousandth of a tree , and he took a banana skeleton , and he took a bow , started a different dog , and he started to get a little dog on the table with the air table .
so you can &apos;t do anything like this .
and this is on many ways a symbol of the inuit and all the native people in the world .
the eastern government government gave the inuit full control of a place , which is bigger than california and texas together .
it &apos;s our new home , and it &apos;s called the &quot; water . &quot;
it &apos;s an independent area . it &apos;s controlling all the main parts .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state , the state of the state , can look for its people and reach .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are traveling to those distant goals of earth , that they &apos;re not at all .
they &apos;re the most important of somebody .
they represent parts of human imagination that go back in the past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children are going to be the ones of the world &apos;s own children , as the dreams of the hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we believe that politicians never achieve something .
we believe that the most important thing -- we believe that the most important thing is that the world &apos;s life is changing , but we think storytelling can change the world and therefore we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website is 35 million more .
156 nations send our carbon data .
our magazines are being read by millions .
and we have a series of trips to the most sophisticated , which we take our audience to places like this , that they &apos;re blinded by the sound of the world , and hopefully they &apos;re going to be taking a core of the center of anthropology , that the world &apos;s worth it to be able to find a very distinctive world , that the wisdom of all people can contribute to our shared well-being .
thank you .
what i first tell you about as quickly as possible is the basic work , a new technology that we have microsoft as part of an issue of an attempt to be a part of a year ago , and that &apos;s a very important place , and it &apos;s a environment that you can either be locally , and it &apos;s a environment where you can either be locally .
we see many , many of the most exciting photographs here , which you &apos;re going to get into a mixed and continuously , new way of being able to set up the way to put on the way that we &apos;re in a way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of the u.s. bank and it &apos;s in a domain of 300 , and it &apos;s in a domain of 300 .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that the performance of a system can be like , is the number of pixels on your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of the design of the world .
this is a new house from dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it really is about a text and not about a picture , we can do something like this to actually show that this one is a real representation of the brain &apos;s and no image .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a more powerful way .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a case of a case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a conference .
and that &apos;s really the pleasure and the good experience of reading a real social experience of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with multiple scales .
we also did something about the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a false ad with very high resolution that is much higher than a normal display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specs .
and this really does this ideas , these limitations for the available place on the screen .
we hope that this is not a parabola and other nonsense , that should not be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the most obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i &apos;m not going to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re going to be able to do this area .
but these are all roads in the united states .
the top on the top of nasa &apos;s picture is nasa &apos;s picture .
now let &apos;s take a little further out of it .
now , this is actually live in the internet . you can get it out of it .
this is a project called the name of the name of the name , which is really two different technologies together .
one is a very good research , and the other is a very good research about the satellite , which is a university student , university university university university , by the university of steve .
and rick ornish was doing this , and an incredibly good collaboration .
so this is live in the internet . it &apos;s driven by the calcium system .
you can see that if we can create this kind of view of what we can do through images and make these experiences of multiple resolution .
but the spatial bias of images is actually in fact .
the most important thing that these images have been doing is they &apos;ve been picking up with the real space , where these images were made in the middle of the canadian , and they &apos;re all done near the most precise , and they &apos;re all in the middle of the world , and they &apos;re all in relation to the other of the time .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have a time to show you other environments .
there &apos;s what &apos;s much spatial .
i &apos;d like to show you a straight set of data of noah and that &apos;s from a early prototype of the world that we &apos;ve been working on in the summer to show you what i believe that it really is the punchline behind this technology that is the most important thing to do on the site .
we had to make us because of the lawyers and so forth .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral coleridge named the only computer with images of flickr , and just give you an anthropologist in flickr , and you &apos;ll get pictures of men in a t-shirts and on the top of the day , and every one of these orange cruise shows a picture that was discovered as to this model .
so this is all the way that they are , and they &apos;re all in the context of each other in relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i &apos;ve never believed that i &apos;m going to work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception .
and i suspect you can see that this is many different kinds of cameras : everything is about professional music , a pretty large number of them , which all of them have been in this environment .
and if you can , i &apos;ll find some of the weird ones .
many of you are mapped by faces and so forth .
there are a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster of babylon dame , which was actually recorded .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point is that we can do things with social environment , and it &apos;s now collected data from all -- from the collective of the collective memory of how , visual psychology looks like the earth -- and everything is connected .
all of these photos are connected and it &apos;s going to create something bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes out of all the earth .
look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen chaplin &apos;s worth of virtual earth .
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s through complexity , with the people that are using it , and the use of the user is always getting bigger .
their own photos will be with a kilo of a group of people who had another person .
if someone has the trouble and all of these sacred , and they would argue who they are all , then my photograph is going to be all the way of the babylon , and i can use it as a starting view of the world &apos;s own organization , and then the way of using the other of the other people , and the study of the other players , and so on to use the use of other people &apos;s experience .
and of course , oil oil is all the most powerful virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that not only is through the surface of the world or the satellite and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you .
do i understand it right ? your software allows you to find that in a particular period , all the images , all the images that are used in the world in the world , essentially , are the associated with each other ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t make anything else than discover .
if you want to create it , they were routinely executed between the images .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the amount of labor of the labor information that many of these images have .
as if you do a drug of images for images , where you &apos;re going to put points and the text of the website contains a lot of information about that , which is image .
but how do you think that &apos;s what the picture you &apos;re doing with all your images ?
then the amount of diet &apos;s labor and the amount of money that makes it really is really enormous . it &apos;s a classic of a romantic road .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , how i hope to be in unison with other things that you &apos;ve heard , and i &apos;m going to try to create some connections , if you don &apos;t notice that .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official tv . &quot;
the official news of what ?
the official health organization of all western societies .
the official business system works like that , if our goal is to maximize the common public citizens , it &apos;s all about the most basic of the freedom of freedom .
the reason that freedom is , in itself , is good , valuable , sense , a long-term premise for human .
if people have freedom , then everyone &apos;s about to do the things that we &apos;re facing , and no one has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common they have .
this is , i think , deep in our water supply , that it &apos;s not going to be a matter of mind .
and it &apos;s also deeply rooted in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say a little bit about the design story .
there are 175 degrees of water in my supermarket when you don &apos;t get the 10 different extra units of water , and 12 and 12 , they could buy a big number of things that they could do in the store for the most unlikely , unlikely case that no one &apos;s last thing to be in the store .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the business store to put a stereo -- speakers , speaker , a computer , radio , a radio , and there &apos;s a lot of stereo , and in this one electronics , there are so many stereo facilities .
we can put a million different stereo together from the components that are going to be offered in this one store .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a young boy , because you could have had a phone , you &apos;d want to have the phone , until he came from ma bell .
they rented your phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
one consequence of that was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have an infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is in the middle -- the most painful , and computer-generated and computer-generated wooden button .
and if you &apos;re not seeing that in your business , you can be sure that you &apos;ll be soon .
and what it does is it makes people walking into business and ask this question .
now , you know what the answer is to this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that are very significant than buying objects , the same explosion of choice is to be able to .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that they go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could do a , or we could do b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a have these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients autonomy &quot; . that sounds like a good thing , but in reality is a shift of the burden of responsibility for making someone know about the people who are doing something -- and that &apos;s not an important thing to make a decision -- the patient &apos;s disease .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like they and me , if they think about it , because we don &apos;t really make sense of it .
why do you advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , you expect to call the doctor the next morning and ask a change of prescription .
so something profound is as profound as our identity is now a choice of choice .
we don &apos;t actually pollute identity ; we invent them .
and we &apos;re so often designed to do that as we want .
that means that every day , if you wake up the morning , you have to decide what a person wants to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where the most common one was , that almost everybody had one and that they could get as fast as they could , and then they got so fast kids as they could .
the only thing was , &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that .
now , it &apos;s just just too simple .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re very carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i get married ?
should i marry ? should i have kids , or just do a career ? &quot;
they &apos;re all more enjoyable .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether that means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m going to give you , and not to get a good grade in my class .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to be more important questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed to do how carl has been able to do that every minute of every single day of every single day of every single place -- to the most ancient hotel .
and by the way , there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you about , which is the most important thing that works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have to make decisions about work , again and again , and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can watch our kids playing football , and we have our mobile phone on one hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and even if you &apos;re all shut down , every minute we &apos;re going to be able to ask our child to the infection of a nuclear age , we should be thinking , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be a very different experience of your child &apos;s experience very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and little things , material things and lifestyle , is a question of choice .
and the world we were living in the world was like this .
so i want to say , there was some choices , but not all of the time was a choice .
and the world we &apos;re living in now is this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about that , so i &apos;m going to be a bad thing about that .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on humans .
a effect , the way , is that he &apos;s flooded instead of free .
so with so many options you can choose , people are very hard to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another one more , an study of investing in volunteers in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to a drug of mine , the giant , giant , about one million employees , about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 percent of the pigeon that was held in the pigeon , and he took the participation to two percent .
they offer 50 degrees of fish -- 10 percent less employees , if they only offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 times the way that they are to vote , it &apos;s so hard to decide what you want to pick it up tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never come .
you know , that &apos;s not just what people have to eat when they go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go to the burning , it means that they &apos;re making decisions so hard that they miss great amounts of their employers .
they &apos;re not participation by the $ 5,000 u.s. dollars per year on the average of the mountain , who would have been happy to reproduce .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
you really want to make the decision right , if it &apos;s for all the eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment of the back , or even the wrong thing .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome paralysis and make a decision , we end up with less sound with the outcome of the choice than we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is that , by the great choice of different forms of dna , if you buy one , it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is the most appropriate thing , it &apos;s just a different decision that you could have done , and that &apos;s what &apos;s been considered a good decision , which is the way that it was a good decision , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s been doing , and that &apos;s what &apos;s been introduced to the decision that it was a good decision .
the more opportunities there are , the easier it is not to regret at all that is disappointing you .
second , what economists call the skills .
dan gilbert made a big point today by telling how much the way we judge things , depends on what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to think about , it &apos;s just attractive properties to alternatives that they &apos;re exposed to , that makes them feel less comfortable with the alternatives that they &apos;ve chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new york , i &apos;m sorry .
but here &apos;s what you should think of .
here &apos;s a couple of on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . they have all of them .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; man thinks &quot; it &apos;s august .
every in my neighborhood is gone .
i could park directly before my house . &quot;
and he &apos;s a couple of weeks from the thought he &apos;s missed the possibility , day , to have a great parking room .
so , lower happiness is lower , which we get through our selection , even if what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more opportunities that there are the choices , the more attractive properties of these choices are going to take into account .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon is a couple of statements .
he &apos;s making a statement about life now and perhaps things slow down .
but a more important point he does is : always to be able to decide to do it for one thing , not to do other things .
and these other things like a lot of attractive properties , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do less , less powerful .
third : the expectation of expectations .
this has met me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in the only way that there was a kind of kind of jeans , and they bought them , and they were bad , they were incredibly reactive and when they had been carried for long enough and they had a lot of time , they started to feel &quot; ok . &quot;
so to buy new jeans , after many years of the university of the old , i went to the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the sales said , &quot; do you want a steady , easy , more easy or more ?
do you want buttons or a half ? stone or acid washed ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you want to cut down far , you know , , blah , blah blah ... &quot; and so on , he told .
my jaw was down and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way that the only way was . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour with all this damn damn jeans , and down the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best right jeans i ever had .
i had better . all these choices had to do it better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it myself .
the reason that i felt worse was all of these available possibilities , my expectations for what &apos;s a good couple of jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations when they only gave them a kind of .
when they came in 100 ways , they would have been perfect , one of them would have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i had to get to what i expected , and what i had been expected to do is in comparison .
and adding the opportunities in the lives of people &apos;s lives inevitably are the expectations that are going to be the people who will be like this .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even if the results are good .
nobody in the world knows this , because if you would , you wouldn &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to be like .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that everything was better than anything worse than anything was worse than anything was worse , it was possible to make a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world we live -- we are wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best for that you can hope to be the things that you expect from you .
they &apos;re never going to be comfortable because their expectations , my expectations , are big .
the secret to the design -- that &apos;s what they &apos;re all coming for -- the secret to the patent system are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short moment of time -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t have a lot of time .
but down is not always that bad thing .
finally , a consequence of a bad murder of a bad jeans , if there &apos;s only one kind of being to buy , that if you &apos;re dissatisfied , and you ask yourself why , who is responsible , the world is responsible . what would you have to do ?
if hundreds of different types of jeans are available , and they buy one of the disappointing , and they &apos;re asking why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to the question : it &apos;s it .
they could do better .
with 100 different types of jeans in the windows , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , when people make decisions , and even if the results of the decisions are good , they feel disappointed about themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant -- not the only , but a significant , significant , significant , significant , is that people have experienced the people who are so high because they have the same experience , because they have to be able to explain their own , and then if they have to explain these experiences , they think it would be their fault .
and so the most important thing is that it &apos;s generally better , objective , and we feel bad .
so let me remind you .
this is the official , which is one that we all think of right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s better than not , but it won &apos;t follow , but it &apos;s not going to be much more choices than something .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time , and we &apos;ve been improving the way we have our overall health .
now , as a principle , i &apos;m almost finished -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a question , that is about thinking about the thinking about that . what all of these choices allow in the industrialized societies is the material .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of them whose problem is not too large .
your problem is that you have too little .
so the things that i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry is steve , and steve mashelkar told you about how these expensive and hard things don &apos;t help to get the car seats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy , it &apos;s not easy to help you .
they &apos;re actually doing it .
they &apos;re worried about that we &apos;re bad .
if something that people have allowed to make our society make decisions that are so much different in the societies in people who have evolved to little choice , not only does life improve , but it &apos;s also improving .
economists call this an application of an application .
and it &apos;s going to be a lot of time that it &apos;s all done -- not just the poor -- because all these big choices are all the way we &apos;re going to affect .
finally , you read that cartoon , and , you know , a sophisticated person , and , say , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this kind of state . &quot;
niall imagination , a more powerful view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i first read it .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to think about the fish .
because the truth is that if you break the car &apos;s water , it &apos;s so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have the paralysis . you have paralysis .
if you break the most pessimistic , it &apos;s so that everything is going to decrease .
they increase paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a business system .
this is almost the absolute safety of the fish -- potentially for fish , definitely for us .
but the key thing is that the key to a metaphor is a recipe for misery , and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and about the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology and now try to get from the digital code in a new phase of biology by designing new lives and build .
we always tried to ask meaningful questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried to have different approaches to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve been digitized almost 20 years . when we sequenced the most sophisticated , the change of the analog world of biology to digital world .
now , try to ask , if we can regenerate lives or whether we can make new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma , which has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we tried to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it on a hundred genes of the 500 or something that is here .
but if we look at this metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our own . trust me , that &apos;s simple , but if we can eliminate all of these genes we can eliminate , it &apos;s very unlikely that this would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to actually curate this chromosome , which allows us to vary the individual components and to ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started to get a chromosome , can we get a chromosome ?
does it allow the chemistry to make these really big molecules , which hasn &apos;t been done before ?
and , if we can , we can start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
our steps at the translation of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has been evolving very slowly , but yet , our final point would be now going to be on an exponential curve .
we started with this 15 years ago .
it actually took some years to start with a tour review before we made the first experiments .
and as it turns out , it &apos;s very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long but it &apos;s a process of a process , so the longer you do a piece of power , the more mistakes .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put together these little pieces and fix the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital of the digital phi x apocalypse .
it &apos;s a small virus that &apos;s killing bacteria .
we made little pieces , made an error error , and we made a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came as we took this piece of chemical chemical and gave it into a bacteria , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code , and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then formed by the cells , and then they came back and killed e. coli .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said they really understand this model .
they laughed more than they did here .
so we think that this is a situation in the software actually can build your own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole whole structure of chromosome ; it has more than a more sophisticated letter of genetic code . so we thought we &apos;re building it in cassette tapes , which is the size of the brain of the brain .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information really has to be correct .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the most popular one in a mistake was a 10,000 base base .
we found the most important thing in the world , when we had used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to make pieces that are 50 letters long , and then they have to replicate the other thing that we have to build smaller amounts of water to build smaller amounts of water .
we have a unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built it in a building .
think about it : we have a computer engine : a , c , g and t.
and this letter of these letters -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids ; and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we just signed up with signed .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we &apos;ve designed the pieces that we could just cut them with enzymes , and there are enzymes that are going to repair these and put together .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces of time , and we put these together five to the two to the letter , to make these together together to put together these together , until to get back to the street .
in every step , we have this kind of stuff in the surplus , because we could make it sequencing , because we tried to create a very robust process , which you &apos;ll see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get the point of the design .
so , this looks like a car designer .
if we get to these right things -- with over 100,000 base base -- that &apos;s not just going to grow in e. coli . it &apos;s all the possibilities of modern molecular biology . and so we applied other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of the brain system that &apos;s used to repair biology to repair dna that can bring together these pieces .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s a organism called the so-called ice system of the three million rads of radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , it has come together as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely dried down , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life in space can be , and moving forward , looking for conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a laser of the molecule that we &apos;ve created by using these processes -- actually we &apos;ve used it only to use the same design of the pieces of the pieces , we have it automatically , yeast , then , automatically put together .
this is not a regular basis of a regular body .
it &apos;s a big molecule that we can even see it with the most playful .
these are footage about a long six seconds .
that &apos;s the publication we &apos;ve just done recently .
these are about the letters of the letter of the code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with the computer structure ever made by people .
it has a more powerful of over 300 million .
if we put it in a more of 10 and no distances , it would include it , just to put this genetic code , just to get this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s a very simple virus , and it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier when you &apos;re in the way we &apos;re doing it : you just take the nucleus out and you get another one in , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about cloning .
in the process of design , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but recently we &apos;ve shown that you can do a complete transplant of a chromosome to another , and that can activate .
we were documenting the chromosome of a quantum field , and it &apos;s roughly the two of them from the other , and we were able to have some of these things , and we gave some of these things to be able to pick up this chromosome , and we &apos;ve got it to be able to break it with enzymes around all the proteins .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that there is the end , but we tried to get the process further .
this is the most popular of evolution here .
we &apos;re all in the species of species here , or a third chromosome , or a third of the other , every time we have a species to a species of a species .
so people who think about evolution as a gene is changed in a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called enzymes that are actually called dna .
the chromosome in the cell has no one ; the chromosomes we put in the cell already .
it was in the cell , and it realized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and it was so that we just had one cell with a new chromosome .
it &apos;s called blue because of the genes we put in .
and after a very short time , all the characteristics of the species had lost and converted completely into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we have to do .
it may sound like genomic engineering , but we can , by moving the most dramatic , change things quite dramatic .
now i &apos;m worried that this is not the most important thing -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i have a gentleman that we might have created , and we may have created a new form of the cambrian explosion in which there could be massive new health extension based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re about six billion people in the next 40 years of the next 40 years .
to put it in my context : i was born in 1946 in 1946 .
today , three people in this planet are still in the year of every year , in 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
it will provide a challenge for nine .
we need about five billion tons of coal , and we need billions of barrels of coal , and that &apos;s a hundred million barrels per day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace it , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 that lands in the atmosphere .
we now have , from our discoveries , from the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the most important ones of the future .
the most powerful one had a dozen components and see the diversity of that .
we &apos;re going to start in the first line of biological reality and in those of us .
we have today today because of this fast , fast , to do what we call the genetics of genetics .
we now have the opportunity to build a big robot , and we can make a million of the chromosomes a day .
if you think about these 20 million different genes , or to optimize these processes to make fuel , or to make drugs , we can change a little bit more molecular than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just a little bit of selection . we can get to the street of chemicals , production of chemicals or more of chemicals , and so on .
this is a shot of actual engineering that we &apos;re working on , and we &apos;re actually going to take new species to take a different way to take a new way of thinking about the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it will look like it , we know exactly how to look at the genetic code .
we &apos;re now focusing on fuels of the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn recently , which is a bad experiment .
we have fuel of the world &apos;s energy and third generation , which will be a lot higher , the much higher , more likely to get the amount of fuel , like fuel or different species of plastic .
but , as we think , the only way to do biology is a big impact without any more increase in food or the limitation of their availability , if we see co2 as a starting , and therefore we work on cells that go to this way .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first generation of the fourth generation , and that in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a way of --
but in our discovery , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is a organism we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about a southern mile , near a little bit of time , in almost a fashion of time .
it &apos;s turning co2 into methane by using hydrogen as a source of energy .
we &apos;re exploring whether we can use carbon dioxide , which could be used to be able to convert the co2 into the fuel , convert the co2 into the fuel .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- -- we have a really -- more important goals like the nutritional fee of all the lebanese industry . right . if you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , a main world of energy .
but we &apos;re working on the same time that we &apos;re working on the same approach for development vaccines .
you saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year back , and you have a little bit of a dollar , if it goes to the right vaccine .
i think that &apos;s what it can be done by using vaccines in the field of water .
this is what the future might look like , with changes , can be accelerated today with synthetic bacteria , more powerful , and perhaps most powerful .
we &apos;re more able to improve people &apos;s light years . our goal is that we have a long enough to survive to survive , and so thank you very much .
and at the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s too far . and for all those that weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that was ever been the most -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that exist in the beginning of a second , and that &apos;s to be in a second to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine below geneva .
we take pictures of these online centers in detectors .
i &apos;m working on this work . he &apos;s called atlas &apos;s detector -- 44 feet in the diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction that you see the scale .
at the 10th of september last year , the machine was the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it &apos;s caused huge amounts of control in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first time of the first time that the entire way to do the lhc , then with a part of the lhc , to make a rain of particles on the detector , to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture at the 10th of september , we knew that the machine is working , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was the biggest business of the world , or this , when somebody went to google page and the front page .
it means we have a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires here -- this golden wires here .
these wires are tracking the water lanes when the machine runs on the street .
now , the engineers under them will look at them and say , &quot; no , don &apos;t do that . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you cool them very far , they &apos;re going to be called the so-called name .
so , at minus homer degrees , cooler than the space between stars , these wires can be the tension .
in one of the connections between the bird cleaners , there was a computer factory .
and so , the wires turn up , and they suddenly have electric resistance , suddenly electric resistance .
this was the result .
well , this is a great thing , if you think that the magnet weigh over 20 tons and shifted around about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to take them out , which we did .
we &apos;re packed them up , they &apos;re called the most sophisticated .
they &apos;re all back to their way back .
and at the end of march , the lhc will be functional .
we will turn it to it , and we &apos;ll expect to be able to collect the first data in june or july , and put our journey on , to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , in a way of mixing these accidents , the debate of the world &apos;s value and engineering in the limits . it &apos;s easy , it &apos;s just down .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to reach the fact that we &apos;re going to reach beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words for english scientist , and i &apos;m going to leave you with a scientist , which is how i suspect when he was the most cosmopolitan of his own book of his own , his apprentice was michael atwood , his apprentice , he said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of human mind than we have to have our scientific notions , &quot; that our scientific beliefs are more than the nature of the human mind .
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
and writing books is my job , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s going to change .
but in fact , recent things is a strange thing in my life and my career , which has been brought to me to do my mind completely .
this strange event was that i recently wrote a book -- a biography called the book of a book called the , loving , love , love -- that , in the other case , had a different , different one , and a big , more honest , international , international , international design .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated as if i was going to the fall .
seriously -- the fall of the fall .
for example , you get worried about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re never going to get rid of this success ?
don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re going to make your whole life , and never create a book that anyone in the world cares about ? never again ?
okay , that &apos;s really what makes you courage .
but it would be worse , if i didn &apos;t remember that i was going to be about 20 years ago when i was a teenager for the first time , that i was going to be a writer with the same kind of reaction of the reaction .
people said , &quot; do you have no fear of having no success ? &quot;
did you have no fear that you kill the humiliation of a letter ?
do you have a fear of being able to make your life more open and it never comes out of it and you &apos;re going to die on a side of a bed of the head -- your mouth filled with the bitter coat of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : yes , yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i had always had that .
and i have a lot more things that nobody would fear .
like algae -- and other things scary things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it for recently , and i ask myself why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that by the time that someone should be afraid of doing it , the work he feels is the work of the work .
and what about the creative association that &apos;s going on , that they &apos;re doing all of us , do not make us more comfortable in the spirit of mind -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemist and i can &apos;t remember a chemist in the 40 years when he was asked whether he was afraid to be chemist .
with your favorite , john -- how do you go to it ?
it just didn &apos;t come , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of the chemist not have the reputation of the people &apos;s reputation .
we seem to have the writers , but we have the same kind of call , but not only the writers , but the most creative , seemingly unstable , seem to be a lot unstable .
everything you need to do is look at the bitter sound of really great minds from the 20th century , which young and often died of your own hand .
and even the ones who don &apos;t even committed to even more sophisticated , seemed to be really neglected from their talents .
norman ornish said a little bit about his death in his last interview : a little bit more killed in my recent interview .
a extraordinary statement you can do about your life service .
but we don &apos;t even have a little bit of a time to hear someone say something like this , because we &apos;ve known this kind of statements for so long time . we have the notion of that , and the collective accepted , that creativity and suffering , of course , are going to be common and that art is going to go .
the question i want to ask everyone here is : is this idea for you all right ?
you feel like that ? because with just one centimeter distance , i &apos;m not feeling at that point .
i find them up .
and i think they &apos;re dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to look at how they get taken into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we encourage our great creative creative lives .
and i definitely know that it was for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , start to start this dark path of the idea of the idea of a way that i just did , in my career , in my career .
this is -- you see , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 of the time in me .
and it &apos;s very likely to say that everything i &apos;m going to write from now from the world is to be the work that &apos;s going to be done after the world &apos;s success of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m saying it , because we &apos;re all here now , all of a friends -- it &apos;s probably very likely to say my biggest success behind me is .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that can bring someone to start to get nine o &apos;clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to drink the gin .
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of the computer of the day , i seem to be able to write that i can continue to write a kind of a kind of a kind of , kind of , kind of , a kind of a kind of , psychological form .
i have to find a way to be a safe distance to the real distance of my own , and i &apos;m very natural about how the reaction will be on the writing .
while i was looking for models in the last year , i &apos;ve been looking for this , and i &apos;ve been looking at the past , and i tried to find other societies to see if they could help , whether they could help the creative risks , associated with creativity .
this quest led me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will be remembered again .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was kind of mixed up to be mixed up , which is from a distant , unknown source to people -- from the street , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these divine folk scientists of creativity , the demons .
and by socrates , he believed he had a more threatening , which he had a lot of a lot of a sudden that wisdom was going on .
the roman had the same idea , called these kinds of creative minds , a kind of a genius genius .
this is great . the roman thought didn &apos;t really mean that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical individual , which was believed that it literally lives in the walls of a computer of a football system -- about like the kind of sound , the most important and the artist in the work of work , and the result of the work was invisible to the work .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s this , because it &apos;s the distance i spoke -- the psychological construct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked like this , right ?
the artist of the computer system was protected in particular , like , for example , to too much tactile , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at everything for you . everybody knew that you had this kind of thing that was going to be a genius that you &apos;ve helped you .
if your work is going to be , not entirely your fault , right ?
everybody knew , your genius was paralyzed .
so people in the west really have been thinking about creativity .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- all the gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no longer a space for the mystic creatures that are linking orders from the divine .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism and the people started believing that creativity was completely from their individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people , or you hear a genius , and instead of doing this , it &apos;s a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think that &apos;s a naked person that thinks he &apos;s thinking or she &apos;s like the vessel , like the mop driver and the essence and the source of all the divine , the most powerful , the great things to do to get them to a more powerful , human psyche .
it &apos;s like to raise the sun to eat the sun .
the emperor and distorted egos and a distorted egos , it creates all of these mountain gaps .
i think this is the most recent thing that we have in our artists of the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to get a age-old understanding of the relationship between people and mystery of creative return .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just get rid of the most expensive combustion combustion of 500 years of rational classification .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would really be blogging , and really , really , the idea of -- basically -- -- the most important thing , people who are failing and they &apos;re using their projects and apply them to their projects and so forth .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you to take this journey .
but the question i &apos;m going to take is : why not ?
why not think about that ?
because it makes sense as much sense as anything that i heard about when it was about explaining the absolute crazy thing of the creative process .
a process that -- how everyone knows that it &apos;s ever trying to make something -- so in other words , everyone here -- not always , always , is not any rational action .
and indeed , he can really feel the most sophisticated .
i had a close encounter recently , as i met the extraordinary american poet , which is now over 90 , but she was telling me that she was in the middle of the world , she told me that she was in the middle of the world , and she said she could feel like a poem about the landscape on her .
she said it would be like a train train .
the country on them would be on the ground .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under her feet to the quake .
she knew that she could just do one moment in such a moment , and that was -- in her words -- in her words -- the hell of the devil .
they ran like the devil to the house as they were tracking from this poem , and it was just that they had to get fast enough to a piece of paper and a pen so that they could get it through the same time through the drawing .
in other words , she wasn &apos;t very fast enough , and they ran and ran and ran , but they didn &apos;t get the house and roll it through the house through them and she would put it on the house , and she said it would go on the country and she said -- she said , &quot; look , a different poet . &quot;
and then there were these moments -- the part i never forget -- she said that there were moments in which they almost missed it .
so , she runs to the house and he &apos;s looking for the paper and the poem through her and she &apos;s taking a pen as she &apos;s swimming through her and then she &apos;s going to get a pen through her and then get it to be able to grab it with her other hand .
they were the poem on his tail and drove it back into their body and took it back to the sheet of paper .
and this is the opportunity that the poem came full of all the time and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
when i heard that , i was a little bit more amazing -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going to happen .
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a training program . i have to get up to the same time , and i would be able to complain every day , and i really suck up and really uncomfortable .
but even i have this thing to break down , sometimes that thing .
and i guess that many of you have done that too .
even i had work or ideas that made me out of a source of mine , which i really cannot identify .
what &apos;s the thing for a thing ?
and how do we get to lose this relationship without losing our minds , but to keep us in the contrary to mental health ?
for me , the best living example is how to create this , the musicians that can be used tom , and i had to interview him a couple of years ago .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of his life was tom the embodiment of the modern artist who tried to be , to be able to put this , and engage with them , and they &apos;re doing their own creative impulses .
but then he was older and quiet . he told me that he was going to los angeles someday , and there &apos;s changed all for him .
he went to high speed as he suddenly hears a little fragment of a melody , which is how it often is , for him , to be pirated , and he &apos;s going to have it . she &apos;s going to have it . she &apos;s a little bit of it . he &apos;s not going to put it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper ; he doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil .
so he starts to get these old folk systems up in him , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing and will be tracked by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t do it .
but instead of panic , he just stopped .
he ended up all the train and did something completely new .
he looked at the sky and said , &quot; excuse me , can you see that i drive car ? &quot;
so , i look at this as if i could just put a song on this ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a second moment , if i can take care of you .
if not , somebody else &apos;s day .
go and get leonard cohen .
his whole process has changed after that .
not the work itself . it was always as dark as ever as it was and ever .
but the process and the heavy environmental processing that surrounds him was , when he was the genius , he took where he was not going to be in trouble and he went back to where he came from . he realized that it didn &apos;t have to be a fair , unfair thing .
it could be a strange , surprising , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the buddhist thing that was not quite tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed the way i worked and it has been saved by me .
this idea saved me as i was in the middle of the middle of the village , the art of the computer , love , love , and i fell in one of these these two cases of doubt that we all fall in , when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not working . you start thinking that it &apos;s going to be a disaster .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just be a project .
but then i remembered how tom talked to the free sky , and i tried it .
so i took my gaze from the manuscript and i talked to my comment towards a blank corner of space .
i spoke to the question , and i &apos;m talking about , you know , you and i know , if this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i have everything i have , invest . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to pop up here and follow your share of the deal .
okay . but , you know , if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , then the hell .
i &apos;m still going to write on , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to put on to record that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like following . in front of centuries ago , in the deserts of the people , they were in the desert of the people with sacred dances and music that were reported hours -- until dawn .
these strong were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , very rarely happened , something special happened , one of the performers was actually made .
and i know you know what i mean because i know you &apos;ve seen all of these kind of performance in your life once you &apos;ve seen a performance .
it was as if the time was going to be a little bit of time and the dancer , and he did not have anything else than he ever did before -- 1,000 nights before , but all added together .
and suddenly he didn &apos;t appear to be human .
it was lit up , and it &apos;s lighting up and down , and everything is going on by the divine fire .
when something happened then , people knew what that was . they called it at his name .
they put them together and started singing : the existential alligator , allah , allah , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historic , as the most important of the oil &apos;s coming , they took this to the kind of practice , the netizens changed over the course of the centuries of the world &apos;s breeding , allah , aggression , aggression , the breeding , the world &apos;s most important , and the most important thing to hear about .
if a performer in spain is something impossible , something magical has done : the existential alligator , the unions , the rabbis , great , prominent , prominent , aka , great , aka , significant , is it : a glimpse on god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but the tricky part of the next morning , when the dancers wake up and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he doesn &apos;t have a more of the god in the sky .
it &apos;s just an aging child &apos;s heart with a knee , and maybe he will never get to those heights again .
and maybe someone will never call god god &apos;s name , if he &apos;s going to turn . but what do he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most popular catastrophes of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of miniaturization if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence is coming from you .
if you might only believe that you &apos;re a loan -- from a spectacular source for a long time of your life , which is passed on to someone else , if you &apos;re done with it .
if we start thinking about this , it changes all this .
so i started thinking and i think that i &apos;m going to be in the past months , while i was working on the book , which is soon going to be -- as the dangerous , scary , strong , expected of my life .
what i &apos;ve got to say all the time when i &apos;m going to get crazy , is : don &apos;t worry .
not a moron .
just do your job .
it &apos;s still for your contribution , whatever he may be .
if your job is dancing , dance is dancing .
if the dumb of the evil genius is to tell you the side of the side , you decide to show a kind of wonder of wonder through your effort , then you &apos;ll get a little bit of a miracle .
and if not , dance still , you dance .
and they &apos;re going to play , and they &apos;re in favor of all of these .
i think it &apos;s and i feel that we should teach this .
so , the most important thing ! it &apos;s for you despite all of this , just for you to just think of the only human love and the most powerful to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
ow !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic winter , the arctic , for nearly three million years , had increased the size of the bottom 48 states .
but this doesn &apos;t press the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic is the arctic heart of our global health center .
she grows in the winter and pollinate in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a very popular thing in the last 25 years .
the most common thing is with red .
as you can see , it &apos;s going to be pushed on the dark dark , and this is the annual ice in winter ; it &apos;s in the summer .
and the so-called engineering , five years old , or older , is almost as blood , which is made out of the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here .
this is a problem , because warming is the frozen reason to turn the arctic ocean into the arctic ocean , which is where there are a lot of amounts of carbon dioxide , which , if it &apos;s a lot of time to dry up microbes .
compared to the whole amount of energy patterns in the atmosphere , that amount of amount of light could double if we cross this critical point .
already today in some flat lakes in alaska , methane is methane from itself .
professor mandelbrot walter der university in alaska , in another layer of a flat sea last night , traveled to another flat sea last winter .
wow !
you &apos;re good . the question is how it &apos;s going to be a bean .
and one reason is that this enormous heat cooling greenland is covered from north .
this is a year of a year of science .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is the most prolific river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the sea level is going through the sea , you &apos;re going to be able to get into the ocean .
these rivers take rapid .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest largest computer on the planet .
the last month , researchers , that the entire continent reported now a negative computer .
and the most important thing that has been turned on for a few of the time is particularly strong in the melt .
this is 20 feet of sea level , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the most powerful , you see the new lakes , which were a few years ago , a few years ago .
40 percent of all people in the world get half their most sophisticated from this kind of thing .
in the caucasus , this glacier is the most important thing for this city .
the most sophisticated ones have been expanding .
but if you &apos;re going to get it , most water will drop away .
in california , a 40 percent reduction was seen in the sierra economy .
this is the most important thing .
and the predictions , as you read them , are serious .
this is the whole world that leads to a dramatic increase to fire .
and the disaster around the world have never been increasing as a very sophisticated and unprecedented extent .
four times in the last 30 years , like in the most recent year , the
this is a completely crude , totally valid .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it is to do .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 , all 24 hours of co2 , every 24 hours every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific in the west , from american continent west and wild of indian media , where there &apos;s a radical decline of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest factor for the global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning from fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the least largest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest largest u.s. companies together with china .
and the suggestion was to build a lot more of the other .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that were taken over the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
and there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the most important and the most important dollar , and the most important dollar , spent a dollar of wood to promote clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
and in the christmas , i went home to my home in tennessee , a billion tons of plastic .
they &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is all in our country of the u.s. capital of america .
this happened for christmas .
one of the commercials of the christmas story to the christmas was this .
the most important guy is a very happy guy , happy fellow .
there &apos;s a shell in the skin and abundance of america , and it helps our economy to grow .
the most common thing is that you get clean .
he &apos;s affordable and more and more vivid , and the workers stay in loans and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful news of the world is the head of the main revolution .
let me tell you a very clear thing . al gore , nancy kamen , harry , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance has been called the world &apos;s own environment .
this is one part of her .
in the middle of the world , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
so we put it on the top of the top , a major social system to spend a significant social system on the way to the truth of coal .
the fact is , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and also smells good .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s leave that off .
so , coal coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean , clean .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean water .
and yet , the burning of coal of one of the main people in the global warming is the remarkable clean , which you see here , changes everything .
look at it exactly , this is the current , clean food system .
finally , the positive alternative of our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis that the national security crisis , the global security crisis .
the red thread that all connect these together is our dependence on the fossil fuels like dirty coal and water oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us from this kind of thing .
and the next 10 percent cleaner electricity in the next 10 years , within the next 10 years .
a plan to get america back to work , and to help us stop the global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
so , you &apos;re going to have a new deal of america . find out more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a more of the u.s.
one of the fastest ways of our dependence on ancient , dirty fuels that are aiming to undermine our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to get good jobs to work .
so , the u.s. government is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
we need to come far , and that &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start asking you to ask the time of your childhood , when you played with a computer company .
while they realized how to remove the hands and pull out the hands , they actually learned to think , and they actually learned to try and solve problems through understanding and change with the understanding of the connections .
the spatial bias is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- with my favorite , and my colleagues , i started to wonder , and i started to wonder : what if we could use computers , which is moving to a flat , and we could organize it as we want to do it ?
this question was that we decided to explore the answer to the answer and developed the answer .
and in short , a computer designer is a virtual computer in size .
you can be moved with the hand , you can see each other , you can see your movements , and you have a screen and you have a screen and a traffic camera .
much more importantly , are physically , why you can just move them through the reach of your hands and access to your hands .
and the most important one is an example of a new generation of a new generation of data .
and if these tools are going to be physical and a conscious awareness for their movements , each other recognizes and the edges of our own , you can start to start with the study of new and entertaining and entertaining .
i start with some simple examples .
this is the most important thing for the most appropriate , and if i put it into a direction , it will move the video forward ; if i put it in the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits are going to be true .
so if i put them side-by-side , they make their interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the oil , you can see that and can be nervous .
and they feel like they &apos;re going to be their movements and bend .
a interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures on data like color like that , how to get it with the fluid .
in this case , we have three main points of communication , and i can use it to cast color in the middle of the middle , where they &apos;re then going to mix .
if we go to it , we can do a little bit more a little bit more like .
there are also some nice ways of the education of the way languages , math or engineering , where we give people the opportunity to give the fast lesson and the results immediately .
here i am ... this is a series that i &apos;m doing with a simple kind of simple design .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of the kind of diagram and the kind of mixture of it .
and basically , every round of applause is random in each other &apos;s way to get a little bit of time and you &apos;re trying to form words , that you will get to be able to get this dictionary to publish it .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , and you have a new set of new and new opportunities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came to the media lab in a trip , and i could move them to try and put it out , and put a video from it .
they really loved it .
one more interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
everything you have to say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest ted center down there .
it turns out he wanted to just stack up the world &apos;s office .
so for him , they were just a little bit more mature .
this is a interactive video system .
we wanted to develop a computer model for the design system .
this is called the .
he can bring new characters into the scene by blowing the most expensive from the table , which shows this character .
here he is going to be the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he &apos;s going to get a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yeah !
by shaking the most flexible and you can put it side-by-side , and it can make characters .
... his own story invent .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open and it can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example i &apos;ve been doing today is to show you a design model for the world &apos;s worth of design that we &apos;ve developed recently and in the world &apos;s business as sound , as a sound , the bass and the drums .
each of them has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can put in any patterns in any patterns .
and you &apos;re going to get them by just holding a light tag on a top of a car .
there are effects that can change live , like hall and filters .
you connect it with a certain note and it tends to be the set of things .
and then more difficult effects like speed and volume that you &apos;re going to apply to the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we start in the world we &apos;re going to be in two more skilled areas of the world , and that in a series of ways , they expand and add a little more voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something like drums .
and now i &apos;m going to switch the filter with the drums , so i can control the effect of live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by putting the pace into one or another direction .
and now i &apos;m going to stick the filter with the bass , for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as it &apos;s going on .
so , i don &apos;t have to plan them in front of the front , but it can dramatically increase ; it &apos;s increasing .
and finally , i can take the whole sequence by causing the most important to the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my excitement is to develop new media skills that are better to fit how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new computer and some of the possibilities that we work in our lab .
the idea i want to give you on the way is that we &apos;re on the threshold of this new generation of design to interaction with digital media , which is the information in our world , which is our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking at the conversation with all of you .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m very pleased to be there .
yeah , so what is going to be like to be a business problem ?
i have to just step back , and it &apos;s a little bit more busy in the process of biology .
i study molecular biology and i &apos;ve been studying this for a few years , and i &apos;ve started to start because i just wanted to know , and i wanted to do it , and i wanted to do it in the study of the study of theory .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity and i wanted to get closer to the matter , so that &apos;s what .
i think that biology in general now , so far , is talking about biotechnology , and biotechnology , everything you count about synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now , extremely important , and much more importantly , will be in the future .
there are so many things that changed all these kinds of plants , like these all genetically modified plants .
now there are craig venter in the world &apos;s office , which is trying to make a lot of the fuel , so gas from algae .
and then there are things that are totally given in the everyday life , which most people don &apos;t realize , but for example , the most people who allow us to wash the laundry , they &apos;re also genetically greedy .
and the list can continue to continue out of the list .
and so from interest to that , that technology , i &apos;m going to go on on this technology .
so what &apos;s the way we &apos;re doing ?
most people know the most people from the most violent .
computers hack , and then it &apos;s always going to be like this , and the media is going to break out any one , and they &apos;re going to make a claws on the media and so on .
this is kind of a very sad thing for the most appropriate , because it doesn &apos;t really do what it actually did , and what it actually is about , and what &apos;s actually behind .
and that &apos;s the most popular thing , in the 1970s , with the street , and it &apos;s also made the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and the problem is not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can be just a more fundamental thing , which is how things simplify , so a question of a question , a question , and how you can do that better or how you do that better .
and it &apos;s been just the way it was , and it &apos;s been the software , but there &apos;s also a lot of the time in the world , there &apos;s a whole whole kind of plastic that &apos;s going to do with the whole thing that &apos;s possible with the whole thing .
and now , in the way , in the way , i &apos;m going to just like biology , and i want to take this metaphor that &apos;s going to be out of synthetic biology , that biology is actually a kind of a , because the most important code is a more abstract code , which is , it &apos;s not quite the same as computers , because it &apos;s kind of dynamic , because it &apos;s matter , so real matter , and it &apos;s not just a matter of light .
but it &apos;s also a code , and it can also be , you know , code and it can be used to be a lot of work , and i found that i was incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper with getting out of it .
it actually has just taken two times the way that these networks are .
there &apos;s a lot of water that &apos;s been done , and that &apos;s originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with an cooperation in india , but now , in india , or active people , all over the world , there &apos;s been .
these are the more artistic effects , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and in collaboration with scientists with these technologies , and asking questions about these technologies , and asking questions , and then make it a creative way , because there &apos;s all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s always about finding a more of the time that a car &apos;s worth of treatment , so that you have a playful deal with it .
and then there &apos;s a lot of the settlement of the world , and it &apos;s a lot of water .
this is from the most important thing that &apos;s a network that is actually more like a forum where you &apos;re going to be able to be , and you &apos;re discussing online online .
they &apos;re a little bit of technical , and also a little bit of a little bit of a time on the road , and then they &apos;re going to ask questions .
and based on these networks that have done all the popular popular , it &apos;s a scene that i &apos;d like to have a little bit of legislation .
here in the image on the left , you see the most powerful , which is a kind of a school , so basically a kind of school , a private school institution , where everyone can get to you .
children , old , all kinds of people go there to just put them in the lab , they put a lab and look at what they can do when they do this .
so here &apos;s a group on the left , in indonesia , called the , which is , but it &apos;s quite a long time .
more than these other two networks .
and the way that you have a sense of artistic is in the artistic aspect of biological materials and , you know , also , also , it &apos;s a very basic way of combining it .
a group of ankara i met a while ago , which is a very , very much , like a public , who would like to communicate the public , which is what they learn in college , and they &apos;ve tried to explain what &apos;s going on in the college of the street .
and i have a lecture on the other image in copenhagen in the medical museum in the medical museum in a way to show a show .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s the most likely young people , but the only thing that one of the things that actually is all united , is this fascination to the technology .
and what you can do with this , and also to focus on society and ask , so , okay , what do you know what you want to do , you have a interest with this ?
so , okay , now to treat biology , you need to kind of have material .
you need biological materials , and you need to have tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
or , usually , under a lab , that &apos;s kind of like a kind of conceptual machines , extremely expensive , extremely , extremely distant , just for the design of the , trained academics , trained to be educated and so on .
and our approach was just to say , okay , that actually , you have to do that .
this is not necessarily necessary because every one of every single species has been actually higher , and actually , the most sophisticated technology has actually evolved more than most of the most sophisticated technologies .
and the o thing with this premise with this premise has been tried to put brian fry in england , and then i put a video tag in england , and then a more of the time , and it &apos;s a , and it &apos;s been adapted to bacteria , and then it &apos;s been adapted to bacteria .
so every one of those , once a soup of soup , is that it &apos;s been left for too long , even before .
i &apos;ve tried to go home in my lab , a little bit ahead , and then i was buying so much as a bit of time on ebay and made a little bit of a test analysis , so that &apos;s the reason i &apos;m going to make a test , so that &apos;s the reason i &apos;m going home .
now , this is not supposed to be a joke , but it &apos;s not .
here in the picture , you see the lab , in the lab , so , in the way , a garage garage with everything that has been in college , a group of different things that university has been doing , a group in paris , which is what &apos;s built and pretty interesting , and it &apos;s pretty interesting , and it &apos;s pretty interesting , and it &apos;s pretty interesting .
and this is a little bit of a sudden that &apos;s called the following , which is the kind of , which is a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of kind of , for molecular biology .
and yes , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively diverse , so there &apos;s a lot of people who are going to do that by home , and so far to big organizations that are still in the form of the world .
but always always the approach , that it &apos;s just going to be easy and accessible .
the first project we did as international group , when we were really aware of ourselves , we &apos;re now here as a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people who always are doing this and we &apos;re going to be doing this .
and then the most important thing came from the founder of the founder , and i said , &quot; well , we have to really meet ourselves , even real meeting , and then have two things organized , and then two things , and a few things , and shortly on the ground , in san francisco , in san francisco .
and , then , because then , okay , who are we okay , who are we going to want what we want , what do we want to share ?
and what are our values and what are our purposes , our foundation ?
and then we &apos;ve got a job of a job of labor .
this was quite intuitive , so everyone has just just just like his wishes , his wishes , and what it &apos;s going to be asking , then , then .
there was one of my opinion , i think , a very good code .
and then we have that , and that &apos;s not really standardized , but that &apos;s what i think has been pretty good , that people are really convinced about this .
and we even tried to bring that into academic world , but it &apos;s kind of not that way .
so i think we &apos;re in the way that we &apos;re in the way that academic world is actually going to be the academic world .
yeah , what are we doing now ?
a project i did with the most uplifting in switzerland was that we wanted to build a so-called optical event or optical tweezer .
that &apos;s when you focus a laser beam , on one in the room , then you can catch little particles in the air or in the liquid and then move into this focus , so , that &apos;s where a kind of a design of a computer in principle is basically .
this really works , that &apos;s what &apos;s done in the academic state of science , and we thought , okay , we might have , you know , have a webcam , then put the lens , the lens , the lens , it &apos;s going to be a microscope , which is something that &apos;s worth more light .
you see that down there .
and then we have a little bit of a torch , and then the torch came out and then try to focus on this camera .
and that &apos;s not what i did , but we &apos;ve learned a lot about it .
so another project that comes from the french group of paris , which has worked , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and it &apos;s a really like , so a kind of a , such a kind of a , so that it &apos;s so much , so it &apos;s busy dealing with the computer , his favorite , his favorite , his name is sam .
he then made this one helmet because he built this helmet in cooperation , and in cooperation , that was walked .
then the visitors could go into the room , put in this chair , put this helmet on this chair .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought , or how they thought , are then different lights in the room .
a pretty nice project was quite a pretty nice project .
another thing from the united states , which is also with this kind of thing , is that the most frustrating , is the most frustrating , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , to reproduce , to reproduce , to breed , to breed so you can make it visible .
so if i do this , the most important thing to do is go to the scene of the crime , then there &apos;s any kind of plastic , and then they do this approach , and then they can say , okay , this hair belongs to this man , so you can say , &quot; okay , this hair &apos;s heard of this hair . &quot;
and the machines that do something like this are pretty expensive that you &apos;re buying in commercial , the cheapest ones go to the bottom of the world .
and that &apos;s not in the lab , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be much more .
so this is just a use of many , which is to do with it .
and they have two builders , and they said , okay , we &apos;re doing easier and cheaper , and then they &apos;re just open source , so freely available hardware , so open hardware , that &apos;s the kind of device that &apos;s actually brought up and are now the cheapest vendor of these devices .
i think somehow , as six dollars , or something .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely in a framework where it &apos;s going to be available .
so it &apos;s a very crude hack .
a project i started to start building was a computer company .
and it &apos;s , yes , like a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a , two inches or something like this .
you count a laser on the street and then the most expensive , and then i have taken the sanitary and then shot the ones that i got on a sanitary and then put it on .
so the device you see there is not working .
but this is my prototype , but that &apos;s what i looked like quite nicely , so on a branch , the thing on the ground , electronics , and it was the pressure , and that was the pressure , but it was the pressure .
and then i took a laser camera and i put it on this .
a very high , if you make the full power with water , the enough pressure , so i think , as 40 to the bar of the bar , i think it &apos;s about it .
and then you can then accelerate the particles , and then you go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about the cost of a little bit or something like this , and something like that , to the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
and this is the moment that the core of the scene is just to increase this availability of technology and also increase the information and the information and the most expensive that more people can get involved .
because , as the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it and also not a chance to make sure that really good .
because if you just read about it , it &apos;s not the same thing as you did , and you &apos;ve seen it .
and i think technology is always going to be more important in our modern societies .
and if you can also make a meaningful citizen in society , and you can make a commitment , you can do that , then you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you also have to do it and understand it to make it happen and understand it .
and then the most important thing that happens under the open-source open is the open of science and citizen science .
so , as citizens , you &apos;re being able to do it , and you &apos;re being involved in these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s the core core of the most important .
these are the people who are at least officially officially presented on the website , and they &apos;re on the website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and it &apos;s interesting that they also are in southeast asia .
i think that &apos;s what i think are less people there , as actually .
so i know about some who don &apos;t put in .
and these are just the curvature , the individual people .
in part , with these online systems , these places are put together .
and that &apos;s very much in the beginning .
and as i said , it &apos;s just beginning to start .
and the most important thing , the most important , because the most popular in berlin was the first one .
and this is a giant network now , which is , yes , that has become the world , which is all over the world .
and we hope that we &apos;re going to stop ourselves , and then we &apos;re also more connected to it , so that it &apos;s also more than people can be involved .
and i would invite everybody to be involved in this and even try to do whatever .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not impossible if you have enough curiosity and you &apos;re going to stick enough energy , you &apos;re also going to go far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hi .
how do we actually work with people ?
this is a question that i &apos;m very moving to a designer , but also in the area of the brain , and in front of the field of the field , in the field of the user , and all of the things in the field .
there &apos;s about how to meet people in interactive media so they can use these interactive media and create it a very much more equal experience .
because i think that the interactive media in us , in our field , is responsible , cognitive models , so paradigm that has been pronounced in our biological memory very , very long time and that we can only generate the only interactive media .
and that &apos;s very amazing because you really believe that these are the most important ones that you &apos;ve been looking at , that the one that is actually going to bring you into the future , but actually it &apos;s so that the future is in our own root .
what are actually actually the basic models of what are these ?
i read four main pieces of email and i want to explain to you a little bit about it .
to be more cognitive models and that &apos;s the models that we have in the 1990s , we &apos;re in the pre-industrial times .
and to these kinds of models , we heard that we have basically natural relationship to virtuality .
this is basically a very unusual thing .
but i &apos;m going to take you back to this , and you &apos;ll prove to you by trying to prove that you have a natural relationship in virtuality .
the second aspect is that since this particular period of models , we &apos;ve been able to be able to talk very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very different language .
and the third area , actually , is about itself .
we all know that the interactive media is definition of definition , which is the denial of the linearity , and of course , we say we &apos;re feeling the linearity today as normal .
the fourth point is that the story is a place of the world &apos;s place .
now , what &apos;s the deal with virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i want to prove to you that .
how many doors have the house where they live ?
we &apos;re not going to answer them immediately , but it will happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
they go through the spirit of this house , in the way they live in the spirit , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they &apos;re actually doing the reality and they &apos;re very much without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and we &apos;re going to be able to be able to address the virtual reality in our educational system , and we can actually do that all the time .
and this is the wealth that the virtual reality of the reality has to do , which has also required the people in the &apos; 90s , because they had nothing to do .
they had no books .
or they didn &apos;t have any no more sophisticated .
they had no mass media .
the only thing that had had was her head .
and in this head , memory was happening .
in this head , you know , the grooves were flooded and using this virtual images , the imagination , also passed on .
and so it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
so the interesting thing about this is when i can make a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s what it is .
the interesting thing about this is that at the same time , the human being was the same as the medium itself .
now , if you &apos;re going to think of a piece of time .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i &apos;ll talk to you about this .
the key tool of the computer system has been the stories for the sake of stories .
and the priest , priests , call the , were more humble , to keep knowledge in stories .
and we still have very , very strong on stories .
the author of the book of the head of the head , jonathan mcchrystal , we &apos;re still going to be a year of a year of stories , and we &apos;re still going to see a year of stories in the world .
this means for a child that &apos;s to reach it to the most of the time of the world &apos;s life , and spent most of the time of his life .
now we think our love is based on stories that we have sat on the lap of our parents .
no , no , no , far .
this is a lot more , in the slums of the pre-industrial times .
but for me , in the part of the interactive media as particularly impressive , we have a se in our biological memory , which is the ability to think of the ability to think .
i brought you an example of the north pole of the north pole of the u.s.
and life lived in the most violent of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very , very crude area , and you had to navigate , from island to island to raise food .
and that &apos;s what they did with this so-called so-called the so-called ice system .
you may know that , if you &apos;re interested in this , you know , a bit of the australian american american .
they have similar principles .
they have no more sophisticated , but they have used the same as they have , or also , they have a lot of water .
and what the interesting thing about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be mapped by songs .
and when the language was talking about the language of the language .
that means you &apos;re going to be talking about sound and rhythm .
and this sounds and this rhythm , the geology , the topography of a region , and that has enabled to allow you to be able to get these songs and put it together , and then put it back to the left , and then back to the left and back to the left .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to come from a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s happening in this ?
it &apos;s that that &apos;s the same as a half machine machine .
we &apos;ve moved to the so-called so-called the so-called ice system .
it &apos;s happened , and it &apos;s happened , and it &apos;s the book , and it &apos;s the book of the world .
and that &apos;s what happens , that we have the responsibility for our memories and the other of our individual memories of our individual memories , on external media .
on the book and on the picture .
so unfortunately , we have god &apos;s own piece of time to go to a little bit of a lot of time .
virtuality suddenly has become alien for us , and it has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous scientist &apos;s famous prize , has gone to say that this mass mass , he means the book and the image , so not television , the internet , and so on , what we call a mass mass of mass media , and our ability to have to have a mass of mass media and our ability to have a mass of mass media .
let &apos;s make a little bit of a plastic test .
the news machine to the age machine .
what has influences our own minds on our thinking and our memory system ?
then the main effect of the pre-industrial cultures are the jargon .
and they &apos;re going to be over the centuries of centuries , and more of the time that we have in the world &apos;s impact .
that means that we have to remember , we &apos;re a lot of common , widespread , common patterns , in masses of memories that we can hang on our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more ourselves .
we have an abstract language .
we don &apos;t think of the thing anymore in pictures that things don &apos;t exist anymore , but we &apos;re going to make them our language .
we &apos;ve used things to make things linear .
and we have the linearity as law , and there &apos;s only exceptions , like the most important ones .
what we &apos;ve left is the most important thing .
still , we &apos;re very , very strong , very strong , very strong .
the question is , what is going on ?
we had the most popular thing , we had the machine age , and we &apos;re going to go to this called the so-called name system .
this sounds very , very , very , very , very , very interested in science science , i know .
but these concepts of the design that are bringing us this back back to this possibility of opportunity to explore our skills again .
there &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about the design of the world , it &apos;s about the design of the world .
i want to just explain a little bit about this .
there are technical concepts like this augmented reality , which is the augmented reality , which is the distributed reality .
so if you look at google , for example , then a concept is a concept that lets us combine the virtual world with the real world , which is our collusion to the most normal , the virtual , natural , natural to feeling again .
another example is called virtual reality .
so , of course , the thing that &apos;s going on is that i hear that in relation to my talk , because we &apos;re moving into physical , virtual worlds , all after the model of the design system .
and other examples of the other example are the most smart , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
all this needs to take our ability to do our basic ability , virtuality as a real habitat .
i &apos;ve been in the conclusion , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , that &apos;s the most amazing thing of michael poupon , the most powerful of michael &apos;s , and the most powerful , and the silver community .
and the two of these are also here today .
maybe you can stand up for a minute , so you can get to the two to the rest of the project .
and this project i brought as an example of how to do this , again , cognitive models .
the whole thing is , i have to say , i have to say .
what the most powerful thing about , of course , is a computer game .
and if i say computer games , they probably have very likely to have people , that any people of people , some of the people , are playing people with a little bit of the people who play with them with any of the people in the hand .
anyway , they &apos;re doing that in the right way .
this is a game for the outside .
and that &apos;s what i thought is that i discover the world &apos;s worldwide discover , so i discover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data that we produce , the world &apos;s real world .
i apologize that i have to shrink so much .
you can explain that much better , because there &apos;s more than that there .
and it &apos;s about that i discover a city by looking at what was being positive or negative .
and so i get from the city to a very different sight , which is , i see negative and positive zones of a city and get a whole different , virtual map of a very real city .
and we can now see that .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little bit of what you &apos;re seeing right now .
of course , these virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , yes .
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds .
so , i like to summarize my talk , and that &apos;s where the characteristics and the skills we &apos;ve taken from the most cosmopolitan , and that we &apos;ve got a little bit of a little bit of a time of the age of the brain , that the way that we have a little bit of the time , and that we can actually get into the way that we have , and that &apos;s actually the way we have the complex , and we &apos;re going to get into the way that we have , and we
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be able to be in you .
i &apos;ve been asked to be a bag of a bag , and i &apos;m going to talk to you about it .
it won &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m also going to get to get the same way out there .
but i &apos;m just doing it as a little bit of the &quot; n &quot; little .
yes , kids are curious from nature or should be curious , designers also .
i &apos;m a creator of house , so i &apos;m also involved in the subject of curiosity and how the curiosity also change our thinking , and why we might lose , and why we might have to be curiosity and we need to be able to get it back to the other time and so on .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re dealing with next to the actual experience of the actual human being .
when professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to be in the &quot; n &quot; in the &quot; n &quot;
and that &apos;s what i had about half a year .
a more natural user model of natural user interface .
now they &apos;re going to ask questions why all of the designers start with so natural , more sophisticated , interaction of communication , and so on .
and i just think of one of these little devices , because things are supposed to be more intuitive , always natural , more natural , and there &apos;s a look , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually for us , of course , what is a lot of the time of being human .
and i have a natural user in the field of natural user interface , so the next generation in the way that human computers are in the relationship with the computer in the process of the human computer , as our tools , or how the computer is changing from the machine .
so i &apos;ve been busy doing that when , of course , what &apos;s about , of course , intuitive .
maybe again , a look at this .
why does that happen at all ?
so if we look at the development of our society , here &apos;s a little bit of a moment , we &apos;re going to move from the third in the fourth stages or the fourth .
so from modern in the world &apos;s office .
every society is shaped by a brain virus .
the first thing that the language is about .
that means you &apos;ve been talking to a common language , you could communicate with each other , is in the same cave , or in other areas , has developed cities or in other areas , or it &apos;s created a way of creating a whole , or a kind of a design system .
the most natural thing was , the language , something very natural , something very natural .
it was also , you know , learning , so , no kind of a toddler can talk about nature , but we learn it to be more sophisticated and natural , of course .
that was then harvested by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
that was a computer designer , because of course , you started to capture the living language , of course , in the form of writing , which is what is the point of what is going on and alive , and i &apos;m going to start with it , and i &apos;m going to be in stone and i &apos;m going to do it .
depending on how i &apos;m going to go and when i &apos;m a little bit of a time , of course , it &apos;s a very different coverage , when it &apos;s alive .
but then , then , the script was going to be a little bit like a computer designer , got it .
then the next generation we actually live in today is mostly alive .
this is just through pressure and print glass , with chronos and others .
it was the same as a kind of a , where the fiddler , and other people , they said , are actually very amazing when the people start reading , then the next time they start reading , they want to be more mindful and , of course , that &apos;s completely deadly .
and now we come into the next generation and the exciting one , such a single , a few hundred years , and we &apos;re at the moment that we &apos;re in this very , very , very , very , very important stage that we &apos;re going to be doing this .
so , of course , the confused to us , because we see the one side that the new media , the social media , facebook , and so on .
with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what the old thinking is , is not that in the most unlikely , and no beef is more or more , or any other phenomena , which is , i just want to just get this out and want to be a little bit more like that .
and these two worlds are just going to push together , new and old thinking .
so the exciting thing about this is , if you &apos;re the guy , these new society , these are the most powerful , many mechanisms , and principles of the field of influence , and the key paradigm from the most violent .
but now not on local level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the theme of ecology is a global one .
not when i think of local internal and the neighbor , less internal , then it doesn &apos;t work all the time .
that means that in the local village , it &apos;s actually become a global village with the same principles , of course , as well , but also the total transparency .
as you know , in the village , who has what has been about who and when , this is what this is happening today about this extension of our self , through these mobile devices .
it &apos;s that we know global tourism and always better and better and better .
it &apos;s like it was used to the village .
so , before the background , i just started to look at what &apos;s called what &apos;s still , of course , what &apos;s going on for us , what &apos;s the point of what we might do , but what makes the difference ?
because people are often coming , they can &apos;t do it , so they can &apos;t do it for each other .
so you have to deal with what &apos;s called the , and not just it , it &apos;s just changing it , but it &apos;s going to be better .
and of course , when it &apos;s also intuitive and how i can take a function of it , and just as a function of things that you can make , you &apos;re going to be a very intuitive , so you &apos;re just doing it , because you &apos;re just doing fun .
you &apos;re in the study of the perception , and the subject of perception and the subject .
and that &apos;s also what you &apos;re going to see , and then you look and watch , ok , now i just look at the inner self .
and what &apos;s really there in there ?
so how do we work when we &apos;re going to go there ?
and what does , of course , , intuitively , intuitively , and how our channels of perception and how does the cognitive process work ?
because steve jobs once said you &apos;re going to dig up to dig it up to a little bit of time .
so you really have to look at the details when i want to make something more like a little bit of a little bit of a little bit intuitive , and what &apos;s that meant in the core .
and you see , you know , you have a our seven senses that most think we have , now , there &apos;s almost seven , because it &apos;s certainly going to be a very , very common point , and it &apos;s also going to be the next , and as an extension of self , and then it &apos;s also the next one that &apos;s going to be done again .
and to look at how we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many use the word , but not what it means to be a detail .
but i have to understand in the core , understanding the ability to understand when information is about information , when data is made of information and information , so i know how to do things like that , and of course , i can do things like that .
and of course , how design influence on perception .
we see this when i do things , then i can make them confusing how to do it on the right , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can actually make it intuitive , by showing things .
so much natural , in a head , but i look at a little bit right , where is salt and pepper .
and if i tell someone , give me salt or pepper , then he &apos;ll just think of where it &apos;s in there .
and the left just intuitively access to me and then hopefully that there &apos;s no sugar in there , which is the salt of the salt .
but also our perception itself , as you can also do , also .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the little , although not the case , but they &apos;re just very close to the same , and yet our perception is changing , depending on what context we do .
anybody know what that is ?
go on .
so , the math designer should work .
there &apos;s a more of my glasses there .
so it &apos;s the n .
a second circle starts to pinpoint certain similarities or to associate .
and if i stop a more of the time , we don &apos;t see a unit of that , which is , the circle , circle and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a different one .
it &apos;s called the way you &apos;re doing it , or you &apos;re just in the perception of the perception that you can also see in the perception .
so , for the creator , that &apos;s mostly the first semester , the great ted class .
and the way that they go close to the continuity of the continuity and so on .
and then , again , again , again , forget .
but this is an essential important component , if you want to design things according to the same as well as you can do .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting , is the kind of view .
sounds very , very banal , but it &apos;s very exciting when you get closer to it .
so we have the eyes , and now we think we &apos;re looking at the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you &apos;ll see , just by the back .
because they &apos;re a assumption for the front that they see something they see , the circle of the circle .
that means we &apos;re only seeing our first , before we see it , again , back to our back in our own field of technology to say , okay , okay .
i have this cognitive engineering , you have what you want to see .
and that &apos;s then there , again , that comes back .
then again , again , because the back of the back is not going to go back and say , well , look at it , and sure , if you look , it &apos;s what you see , even that you want to see .
and then again , again , it &apos;s going to be a moment and then it &apos;s just seen .
so a whole , very , very , very , very , very important process , like things happen , and what &apos;s happening for the world &apos;s disease .
i don &apos;t know who you know about this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve described .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
does anybody see a particular thing ?
a computer designer , right .
if i saw that that there &apos;s a computer in there , you know that .
they &apos;re never going to forget about it because i &apos;m showing you where the most popular thing is .
now you see the most expensive .
and on , you &apos;re going to see it always .
so , i &apos;ve actually gotten them to be hunted to the fact that they don &apos;t recognize any pattern , but i have them in a very short time , and i &apos;ve got this dog in the very short term , and again , to see this dog in this obscure picture .
and this is the projection of the view , and it &apos;s a map of the puzzle .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m going to go to the front , i see the most expensive .
i see the most popular .
so , very exciting processes that then , in this , you know , gray is actually not , but here in this kind of room , it &apos;s just a lot of work in this kind of room .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know , a little three seconds , until i kind of look at the present , i can also bridge very well , and i can also bridge it very well , in which i &apos;m always with three seconds .
it has to process it as a present .
then it goes into the past and so i can bridge very elegant , for example , on the computer , when i know this phenomenon .
what does the milliseconds take down milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
and a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time that you fall in love with .
that means , if you know that , you know , you know who you look like , you know , i &apos;m not going to take a gun for who you can see , because i can &apos;t get a gun for what &apos;s going on .
and then milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the most of the perceptions that we have .
that means that the first impression is happening in a fast fast speed , as we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we &apos;re kind of trying to protect our environment , so we can think about it as well .
of course , the creator of the subject is not just a human issue and neural tissue , or the other , of course , with the subject of the brain &apos;s subject .
so , like a human being , a person with certain things .
there &apos;s a lot of time that &apos;s practical , so the kind of thing that &apos;s practical , or more important , or more important .
there are a lot of time where i know where i really have to reach .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why is there anybody for such a small , small , which is almost not a matter of time , so that it &apos;s not so much more accurate ?
there are more than symbolic , on the most remote , on the top of the world we &apos;re also dealing with as a creator .
back to my actual subject , the natural user interface interface and the subject , which of course , is also more enjoyable .
and the idea is , as i can get a certain goal , i can get a certain goal or how to get a user in a particular form of magnitude , efficient and african-american a goal .
it &apos;s like the norm to say that .
how can i make something more like this ?
i can use that right or need to be the &quot; n manual or need &quot; i &apos;m going to be a training .
and less , more , or more , it &apos;s .
that i &apos;m just making it different and beautiful , is not that it &apos;s better to be more empowered .
you have to understand that .
and if you &apos;re in part of the software that we &apos;ve seen , you &apos;ll see , then , you know , why glamorous percent of our current software is a little intuitive , or not in a way , which is a lot of intuitive , and it &apos;s not useful , even though it &apos;s a very intuitive software .
and so , intuitive , intuitive , is not just an alien , and a fundamental climate crisis , if i want to make a technological tool , and a fundamental general system , if i want to make a difference .
why ?
because in the rule of the new species of design , the natural user is more complex , for example , five times faster in average on our destination .
you have to imagine that if you do something the classic , you need to take five hours and have a new kind of natural software , just a hour of natural software .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you can probably go home four hours to go home , but your employer or somebody falls , you know , it &apos;s a way to do it with the four hours .
but i want to say that it &apos;s a very common thing for us to do , too , even things .
and then when we go into the field of software , the first one of the first projects that the controls were , the first one , were very abstract where you needed months to deal with these systems .
then the next one , the next , which has been , with the blink of the model , or mental model like the software , they worked , which is , you have a idea of something that &apos;s metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop , to make the computer useful .
so no longer zeros and those are the ones or the other code , but it &apos;s a metaphor .
it made all the time , but it &apos;s also much better , but it &apos;s also much better .
the next generation of graphics is working very much more with behavior .
so i &apos;m designing as a creator , as a creator , as a result .
this is also a paradigm paradigm .
that i think that &apos;s the first time that i &apos;m going to get to the success , just the most expensive one .
and if i go to a step more , in these natural users , interfaces , where i &apos;m a voice , by a voice , by a touch , by touch , by gesture , and no longer a mouse , and the things that have to steer , i &apos;m even faster and more .
but that &apos;s also what leads me to the point , when the things are going to be intuitive ?
if you &apos;re going to be more intuitive and then i have to be trained to see my little friend here , and see what it does for a point of view of the design of the world , when is it really a little bit intuitive ?
and that &apos;s for us , for us , a little bit intuitive , if i have to think about it as much .
so it doesn &apos;t seem to be like , but it &apos;s just going to be doing spaces .
the less i kind of think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
that means that we can actually transfer existing growth of a to something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can use that to be a function of the world .
that means i can just put a very intuitive , human health project on a software and make the software much more powerful .
and of course , the question is , what is the most important thing that &apos;s like the most important thing to do from us and now i have to tell you .
this is called the so-called engineering system .
and that &apos;s using every one of us and the most devastating , and it &apos;s a photo-real and understandable , more sophisticated , more educated , more educated .
that &apos;s all that makes you all the time , but it &apos;s unconscious , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive or partly , as well as a fake .
the model is already going to be in the womb , and it &apos;s a lot of time , so it works in the world at young and old , and it &apos;s used by us all the time , without the most that that model has been there .
and the most important thing about this is about 50 to a half to the time of the time we &apos;ve been able to have activity , so in sleep , you &apos;ve noticed that it &apos;s less often more frequent than the day .
i can now be able to make this mental pulse of consciousness , and i can get more interested in a plastic form , and i can get more interested in a plastic form .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the brain &apos;s metaphor , but now not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a brain &apos;s system , a laser , a computer scientist .
and this is on a higher grail of the most violent metaphor than the transmission of a classical metaphor , which is the most prolific .
and if i &apos;m going to be able to get this , for example , in which i &apos;m going to be engaged in a while , more like a selection , i think , it &apos;s going to be big to me , i can see it in the detail , and i can send it to a little bit , and i can send someone to go to it , and go to your shop and go to your shop and keep your own .
and then i can transmit the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to take this through a survey .
it &apos;s already been eaten .
in addition , i sort of interact with the object , again , again , zoom back .
i &apos;ll get the whole picture of this , now , and can just be able to filter on this , and can tell me all of the things that chocolate is .
and once a interface , what &apos;s more intuitive and much more natural .
because , because i can grab things like the pieces , and they can come to me , and they come to me , is much more natural than the cast of sulfur , or other mechanisms , or other mechanisms , or other mechanisms , can make these things available .
imagination is more of the more powerful carbon vaccine , and with this sentence , i want to close with you a , a and again , also , designers have to think differently to come to new solutions , and i &apos;m very passionate about that in this sense , and please thank you for your attention and please .
i want to help you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first thing you &apos;re going to be as a child is that you &apos;re going to make it a lot of time , which is what you have , yes , and depending on whether your parents have allowed you to play more or less in the business , and the more , you &apos;re going to do it , of course , that will be done , of course , that will be done .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t make it .
so , all of that is , these are , and curious are people , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m now about this , basically , this whole whole , more convenient , 40 years of power , to make the quality of the difference .
and there &apos;s a central point .
and it depends on phosphorus .
give me a chance .
every day you give up a + scale , about two grams of phosphorus and you have to take two grams of phosphorus every day .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only be a meringue through the world &apos;s star .
if we did not take phosphorus , we &apos;re actually going to be a bit .
it &apos;s amazing that we &apos;re going to be here with something , which is actually the case , but not that way .
because all of the time talking about energy , but nobody talks about the most expensive .
the most critical thing is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have phosphorus and already now , through the world &apos;s world , now , in the world , we &apos;ve been brought much more uranium into the environment than in all food plants .
in the last 20 years , the big ones in the fields have been distributed in our fields in germany .
and we take it all up .
it makes leukemia at children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little more harmful .
so , for example , the environment , gets less car .
the environment , make less waste .
the environment , the world , more energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
this is how i would say , &quot; if i say , your child , just three times , will be five times more than five . &quot;
this is just a little less destruction .
if we think about the starfish from the starfish , our whole earth will be used to our entire earth or later .
so , that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at from the starfish to the starfish .
and the most important thing about this is to look at the soil as first .
in the ground , over 60 percent of the internet is stored .
now , we &apos;re building corn and losing it between 11 and 30 tons per hectare , or on the square square meter , or on the square square .
that means we &apos;re losing about five times more than a new one , when it &apos;s being educated .
we can first look at the most sophisticated .
and everything is packaging or content .
for example , in the most powerful 20 percent of the world &apos;s population , there are self-transcendence .
and because we &apos;re older , the self-transcendence will be bigger .
it &apos;s kind of like all of you in the world &apos;s office .
yes ?
a baby needs about six hundred terabytes .
we could reduce that for 10 percent , but what does that do ?
that &apos;s going to be balanced in china in china .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with these biospheres ?
here &apos;s one of the proof that men are not pigs .
let me tell you .
because the phosphorus is emitted in the pigs over the trash of the solid components .
people over the urine .
yes .
so , men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s like to do , right ?
traditionally , we think in the world &apos;s business , we &apos;re too many on the world .
and if you can find the people who are in the people who are going to be able to get it , if you say that , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re going to be a bad thing , and you &apos;re hostile .
and so someone like al gore says one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more powerful than the human population to stabilize .
in israel , you say , if you &apos;re a living person , you &apos;re going to be the earth .
here it says , the more you get more involved , the better .
yes .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh over four times more than we are .
i could also use termites , but in the u.s. nobody , nobody , you know , they don &apos;t like termites , so far , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means that the ants weigh much more than we .
and because they &apos;re physically working as much tougher than we are and because they only live three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , the energy consumption , something about 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you &apos;re looking at how far we &apos;re going to get out of what we really wanted and how sad we are , we can see that we &apos;re at all on earth , you can see that for example , a program has a program , until 20 times you want to be here .
you can only be a little bit of a time , if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you seen a little bit of a tree tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be 2.2 as a trees , yes ?
yes ?
no tree is a lot of a tree .
luckily , not yes ?
there &apos;s no internet news on trees .
there &apos;s still six billion trees in the temperate quadrant .
you &apos;ve heard about a little bit of a matter of trees from trees ?
that means all of our intelligence means that we want to be 2.2 as a trees .
and where you see , even as a bribe , the most cosmopolitan of biological biological agriculture , it doesn &apos;t allow our own business to go back .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really had to go back into loops .
and so we &apos;re too many .
alone .
so that &apos;s what we feel so guilty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no more no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no , the one that allows our own cortisol to go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , which is oil protection .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , it &apos;s the highest , not being there ?
so , yes , yes ?
you can only have a little bit of time , if you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot yourself , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can back our nutrients back .
we &apos;re going to do agriculture in brazil where we take the nutrients back .
we can put nutrients in this way in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china , for example , where we take the waste of it .
in china , a more powerful one is still a more powerful one , in the way , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid , our nutrients .
that means that the western media system is a whole case that the city has always taken , but the farmers never had a little returned .
and so , the cities had to grow more and more , because farmers were going to go and get the cities out and keep the cities on the ground .
so all western rich rich are always expanding until they didn &apos;t have the infrastructure and then they &apos;re the shortest .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done a long time of the civilization of five thousand years , because you &apos;ve been able to bring nutrients to the nutrients .
even today , if you were invited to eat in china , you &apos;re expected to stay in the food until you &apos;re looking at the toilet .
because it &apos;s clare , to go and take nutrients .
you have them to eat them , not to the food system .
that means you can see in the internet , as you can get back to the nutrients .
it &apos;s really beautiful , if you do that , so agriculture , it creates ultraviolet , on a hectare of a hectare of a thousand thousand people , can be used by a farmer , and the plant is able to get a farmer and the head of vegetables and the bikes and the candle and the fishes and the fishes .
and the great thing about this is that the most important thing is that the favelas in the favelas are coming back over 90 percent .
so we don &apos;t need to control people , so little bad .
we can support them , to be good .
this is of course , of course , but the plants are carrying themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by design , which is a farmer that can just drive them .
that means that the most important thing is that the u.s.
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve been building over the last 20 years , not by those of these , ever been available .
you could just be so easy to get a liter of carbon &apos;s and then it would be broken up for years .
don &apos;t find it instead .
that means we don &apos;t need to control people , so little bad .
we can support them , to be good .
that means we need to have phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you &apos;re in germany , in germany , in germany , the best of all the parts of the treatment of the treatment .
unfortunately , not in the lab , but maybe you can help the most expensive thing to do with it .
because the most important tool could be the phosphorus , the best back .
and that has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s really done .
we &apos;ve been using it over three years now .
the dutch government explained it to be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need this overall .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of the wooden nets .
these are the countries who control 40 percent of the u.s.
and the oil will be able to replace the oil .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace .
so it &apos;s not about making the existing one little bit less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s all about questions about what the right thing is .
that &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , you can understand that , of course , because in holland , the country is built in flowers .
yes ?
imagine if you &apos;re your wife &apos;s sad , if you were in the first time you were born , and you come with 50 ruler .
very inefficient .
but it &apos;s really effective , right ?
or take a civilizational one .
a woman in germany eats about six kilograms of three kilograms of life during her life .
it &apos;s about that .
this is not really scientifically accurate because we don &apos;t know how much more powerful it is going to be .
but a random , even at that lighting , can i tell you , is completely inefficient , but it &apos;s very effective , right ?
it &apos;s all that &apos;s beautiful in life , not efficient .
that &apos;s not efficiency , it &apos;s efficiency .
questions about what is the right ?
not to burn the world &apos;s most much better , and it &apos;s going to be a little bit more like losing and losing the whole material for cycles , but to ask the whole material to be more like the things that you add ?
imagine mozart , you know ?
yes ?
if i put them to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with a little bit of water and a glass of water .
so , you know ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything in life is beautiful , it &apos;s not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything in life counts , it &apos;s not about saving , to avoid .
all the whole .
we say the people , oh yes , you don &apos;t have a green in the south .
no , that &apos;s exactly the right thing , right ?
every place where you &apos;re going to get out of the , you can get back , you can get back to it .
but the wrong things .
if you get the wrong things , you have a more of the time .
in how we think about north .
there &apos;s every footprint in there .
if you walk , yes , everybody destroyed the ground .
because the ground is going to die the mosses and the wind and the water is turning away the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water remains longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that becomes a spectroscope .
not a dent .
we &apos;re going to say in germany sustainability .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how do you do it with your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , &quot; do you say , &quot; yeah , i &apos;m going to go . &quot;
this is the minimum .
so not saving , give up , avoid .
every waste is essential .
and it &apos;s a lust when you see in italy , like people in the high bow , like coke &apos;s from the car , to get them off .
because you know , this is a process of life .
it &apos;s the form of a design system , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so , for example , we have developed a more sophisticated , which is in temperature room , which is a liquid .
you can skip where you go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re building all over the place .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they &apos;re going to take the shake to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so it &apos;s two cycles .
not all of it should be sine shirts .
a television or a washing machine that you use , you don &apos;t use it .
just the things that the most important , like the way they do , like the way they do , like the way they &apos;re going to be in biological systems , they have to go to biological systems .
things that are used only to go in technical systems .
but today we just talk about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the most appropriate , yes ?
and the direct ad , and not to airstream the company , in the company , to eradicate this , but that they &apos;re now helping this company to make these products successfully successfully .
because we don &apos;t do things more free , we don &apos;t do things .
yes ?
so , if i put them in to food and say that &apos;s free from the street , then you can &apos;t help it .
no , we &apos;re stuck in what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like a bee .
not toxic .
but everything in that is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can get down to the most cosmopolitan , and you can go down the rubber system in biological circuits , and go to the mud .
everything is a treaty-based of that .
and if it works , of course , we do it for nonprofits , for nike , for the satellites and the whole industry industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the world &apos;s most sophisticated world companies that are caused by the textile industry .
so , that &apos;s why they &apos;re asking , ask them to be asking for people .
hey , nephews , do you really make really serious ?
because now the most difficult thing is that the most successful .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really do it .
so , help me a little bit .
but it &apos;s going .
yes .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been presented .
this is .
we can now do things like that , if they &apos;re going to break , if they break , they can put them in biological circuits .
technical cycles are just as much .
there &apos;s this direct thing that &apos;s going on .
this is the first green backpack , actually , which is made back to the cycle .
so , that &apos;s what you can do in every store .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the e.u. ?
if it &apos;s the waste right now .
all of these biospheres are around , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there &apos;s the front of the street , but it &apos;s also in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastics , so that it can go in biological systems , if we change the most sophisticated , you can just go back to the street , you can get a baby in israel , or tunisia , in tunisia , in tunisia .
yes ?
and if you take these these mosques , they &apos;re flashing , interactively , interactively , and the powder to plant trees .
so this is the baby &apos;s baby for life , and it &apos;s all about beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be more sophisticated , we can be more competent .
it &apos;s kind of a secret print .
yeah , kind of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can even reinvent everything else .
i started a institute .
now , there &apos;s a lot of people working with and they can all be engaged .
there are extra dimensions of a company , and it &apos;s a company where everyone can come .
so no longer save , avoid , avoid , reducing , no more , no , but smart waste .
does it make you curious ?
thank you .
the work of the computer .
music as language .
in the description of my talk , i wrote that i was a full-time , as a as a computer designer , so in english , in english , you understand .
and the king of the written notes in a second music is a book .
that you can &apos;t just put word for the word for word the text in a different language , but also the deeper sense of words and the other sense of the words , so that it has to make a meaningful translation , everybody who has to do it with the world &apos;s own .
now , to translate from german to english , more knowledge can require more knowledge , even if you &apos;re in order to do poetry or even poetry .
but it &apos;s very alien for the census of what we do with our own business team .
as a designer , i just got the written notes .
you think that the composer in the notes have exactly everything that he imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and alert .
these notes are about just as much or alert , as a verbal type , as well as a verbal type of view , a landscape .
because in this verbal knee , the smell of flowers don &apos;t smell to smell the degree of the brain &apos;s point , not to hear the most important thing of the brain &apos;s disease .
that means the interpreter needs to pop up this carbon &apos;s version of the world &apos;s most different , which is a very different , concrete , non-verbal , jargon .
today i want to tell you what i &apos;m talking about otherwise , so , again , a verbal language , even again , to translate a verbal language .
so basically , a translation of translation .
so i would like to pull it up to german , because if i had to translate it to english , it would be really true for me in translation of translation .
so the music works for me so much as the spoken language language .
the lyrics have the function of the letters of a script .
so it &apos;s not going to take just to learn grades and the keys to make the keys on the piano or the right place on a street .
because that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the point of the letters is , you know , when you can do the language .
so , you need to run music for the process of music at least as long as the spoken language .
there &apos;s also a bit of speculation that you learn to be learning for the most appropriate , understanding or you can also speak to the same , until the musical speakers .
the work of the computer is starting to start like a nuclear scientist .
after first , you &apos;ve chosen a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about the world &apos;s reaction , you &apos;re going to be a reaction of the composition of the composition .
you pour information over the piece of the play .
you read in the letters , you know , the notes , notes , or whether it words , thoughts of the composers themselves .
you studied the works that he did before and after .
you compare it .
the motives , to write it .
how and what does he feel ?
how were his circumstances , how the society and politics ?
that &apos;s all interested in me .
you think about it in time by looking at contemporary images , or literature .
but the time you have a revelation , but as an abstraction , you have a rich knowledge to play the composers , and it &apos;s always easier to feel in it , and feel more easier to feel in it .
the composer will always become more to the friend you live with .
his cause to write the piece , will always be more and more and more of my personal concern .
so , there &apos;s a whole different record that &apos;s a very precise record of the philosopher , but just a framework , i now turn this scaffold to the point to make sense and meaning to processes .
i then say to my own words , which could be written between this framework .
i play the way that these notes could have been .
now for me , and for the composers , and what they might now mean for him today .
every note , every phrase gets a sense of it because i feel it , because it comes from my now personal , and it comes out of my own now .
it has to be in this and now , i &apos;m not going to be able to convince my audience that i can &apos;t convince my mind .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been able to have so long in advance .
as you &apos;ve been looking at a happy new day , even though you &apos;re all in the same rituals of life , your breakfast , your breakfast , you &apos;re going to go to work , and i &apos;ll go back to the same piece again .
i &apos;ve become a day older , which is going to change seasons , my pulse rate goes down to the morning , when the sound takes over the morning , it takes back to the sound that the sound comes back home .
i &apos;m going to breathe the audience , consciously , or unconsciously .
all of this is what i do , and all this affects my experience with the composition .
so , quite wonderful , if i stand with a computer tag on the stage and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , more intimidating conversation .
you bring a new idea into it and it &apos;s immediately answered with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting because things that we haven &apos;t practiced , and what you can &apos;t anticipate , and what you can &apos;t even do .
it makes a lot of fun to make music , and you &apos;ve got it as the audience communicating the music .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;ll never play any more like this , like in this moment .
i can &apos;t play as in 20 years today .
i &apos;m going to have more life life than today , and that &apos;s why my palette of the most important time of the brain &apos;s time is much more sophisticated , in emotions and emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;ll also have some of the most powerful things , but for that new supply of supply .
so , a nice physical example of this .
it was on a very high street for the most old old teachers at my beloved old teachers , professor , a famous scientist , a famous scientist , a famous professor of the computer here in the world .
unfortunately , i was too young , so he was a lot of time , and i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortune , very early , with 13 years , to meet and so was i had to go to my school classes .
i was 17 when i went back to one of his courses once , and i played the last four of the ceos from chopin , a computer company .
he asked me what the introduction of this kind of dna was for me .
this is a kind of a piece of water .
and in my inbox , i said , expectation .
he was talking about it and he said , &quot; do you ? &quot;
this must be the most important thing .
because for me , she &apos;s memory .
he was over 60 .
well , with 17 , you have dreams , but not a major memories .
i play the piece today all the years and all of a sudden , and it &apos;s gone to me , even though no one note has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , i &apos;m going to read something new .
one of the reasons that you have from a different area is the shortest water system made .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but too different afternoon , in the world , in the world .
he &apos;s translated the water &apos;s water , so it &apos;s like he saw it , like she looked at him at this moment .
his personal health system of the world &apos;s personal health .
the interpretation of a piece of a piece is this comparable .
now , i &apos;ve been older than the chopin with a little bit of the time when he wrote the piece .
he was just living in a few years .
and it &apos;s important to me , again , to look at the notes , even though i mean to be able to screw them .
to keep the same , right with the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially when he died .
now , how do you start talking to the language of music ?
i said yes , you need to have about the same as long as the spoken language .
often the most important thing is that you &apos;re just learning the notes .
you &apos;re learning the first time you just read a word , just before you just speak a word .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument on the instrument .
and then , if all the fingers and all the way it is like it is in the notes , they come out , then sound turns out , they sound like music .
when it happens , the students get the most expensive piece .
it &apos;s hardly spoken in the business of the game .
well , there &apos;s a lot of time on the front of the road , which is a quick piece .
it &apos;s slow .
according to the , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s most of the time .
but even if you &apos;re going to take this data , it still remains something technical .
and it &apos;s still not a interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something very much about .
because , to make music on the instrument , the way that you can do it is to be there and feel before .
that &apos;s what singing .
a child who didn &apos;t learn that , because it doesn &apos;t have the parents , it will not be done by itself .
this is like the main game .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music to then have a more option , so over a tool , to sound .
people who have never singing , and they never felt immediately with their own body , like it &apos;s , to form a sound .
a phrase with his own breath .
because the music piece is the extension of our body .
our vocal vocal vocal notes to sing our hands and feet to dance .
so the main line is the the sequel of my fingers .
the tune comes out of the brain &apos;s system and the rhythm from the dance .
the continual water system today is not a practical thing .
you don &apos;t need to make music more , if it &apos;s a boring .
no longer required to whistle a car system or to sing .
every one of your own music is going to be flawed if you &apos;re going to be more involved in music .
sure , there are some of you who say yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t sing ?
i &apos;m going to ask you , can you sing , a , because you believe you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
in both words , it &apos;s not too late to start figuring out whether they can &apos;t , or learn how to do these little muscles that are going to set the vocal vocal vocal vocal vocal vocal vocal signals .
that &apos;s what you can train .
or c , because you have it , you have a lot of people who are more comfortable .
so , i wonder how to do this diagnosis , how do you see this diagnosis ?
have you taken a more of the time or a car company , and you &apos;ve got a beautiful , and you &apos;ve been doing it beautiful ?
or d , you may not like music , and therefore , you don &apos;t want to have a failure to do it .
but what i &apos;d been doing is , because music is a beautiful , more beautiful thing .
but maybe you can also even get it more to the other .
well , you can see , all of the time , nobody has to be a viable candidate .
but please say , don &apos;t i , i don &apos;t understand the classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i mean , but surely you can say , &quot; well , you can &apos;t say it .
because i don &apos;t think it says somebody , i don &apos;t know if i can &apos;t cook , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , you don &apos;t give up to food , just because you can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to give up in classical music because you don &apos;t play a instrument .
listen to them , and say , &quot; it tastes you or not . &quot;
whether the music is to give you too sweet or too sweet .
tell that what you &apos;re feeling .
and the time you get the time , and you want to make some more spices there , or taste even fine differences .
now why am i asking my audience to be also being human being active ?
because the music is a language , and a language is to communicate .
a piece of artwork you never look at has no force to be .
the food that was a chef , a chef , was eating a chef , and not just look at recipes , and not just look at recipes .
so you hear about it when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice thing .
when the adult is active , where the adults are actively making music or at least active music , a child is growing up to ask , what color has your flower ?
now can you play me in blue ?
and the kid is playing , after a computer , rather than a red flower , a blue flower .
and this sounds very different than before .
and then that was the first beginning of a own musical expression .
so the first step to an interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece of play today , which originally was written a hundred , two centuries ago , two hundred years ago ?
now , the instruments have moved .
there was a lot of the piano at all time called a instrument .
it was not invented yet .
i think the stream would have been excited if he had the ruler of the modern political technology .
i can now the most popular , which has the stream that the stream has made , to sound on the modern wing , which can &apos;t be able to do a more natural job .
and also , from beethoven , you know that he heard more than he had been deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which is a orchestra from then , as a symbol of the back of the back .
so the composers are based on us , the ones that are reinventing the pieces again .
so they &apos;re crawling up , which they just imagined in the spirit .
and also , what you would think of today in the spirit .
or that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do today , because what you might have thought about .
thank you .
you know what &apos;s envy ?
were they once jealous ?
and how did that feel ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a car .
when i come , with my little v w , and i &apos;m going to go back to this feeling .
i &apos;m taking something through the head .
i say , &quot; what do you need to do a big car ? &quot;
it &apos;s actually going to be half the value of its value .
and , at all , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to afford to do this &quot; n &quot; ?
and then i immediately fall to that .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this awkward sense is gone .
our organism has invented a great way to make these awkward feelings like envy just to disappear .
you can try that with words like revenge or a plea or a plea .
i want to explain to you something today , or a little bit of a spark , which is you &apos;re probably familiar with it .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but think about the lie , as you may have heard , if people say , nobody has the intention to build a wall .
and then rocks , so he &apos;s going to get the vision off .
in such a lie , you see that the liars don &apos;t believe what he says .
it makes a little bit of a sense of it , that it has a very different sense of mind .
he &apos;s just holding it and not himself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , that it has to be fooled by itself .
they need this lie to get a 3,000-square-foot , to get a self-deception .
you can get less easy , yes , or also to collapse .
they need time .
and this time , an anecdote talks about that you might know .
the spanish painter of galileo once has a woman illustrate .
this woman would complain that she didn &apos;t even see her .
picasso says , just wait .
it &apos;s always going to be more similar to you .
and in this place , and if you laugh , you see how important this lie is , and how much time you need to learn something about what artists can tell us .
because artists have a 1975 &apos;s relationship to the lie .
the artist teaches you something , and especially this lady , what you don &apos;t see when you just look at the mirror .
the artist teaches you something like this a portrait , which you &apos;re going to be familiar with when you &apos;re going to look at this artwork .
then this awkward sense of feeling , it may not look like you , and it &apos;s always going to be more similar to you .
here you have this mechanism that we can use to be a lie as a great invention to the design of our foreign system .
and not only in art , even in the middle of the world , in the mythology , in stories , in stories .
you may know this idea of the lady , which was a little day in the mirror and asked him who &apos;s the most beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a computer problem .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this real guarantee that the mirror can &apos;t lie , from that real guarantee .
but we should just be familiar with that , that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a single one somewhere else .
here it is necessary , which we understand under the world &apos;s brain &apos;s brain , again , again .
we need this subject to this lie , which is the illusion of us , without the rest of us can &apos;t live .
we don &apos;t just have the art in the art of the world , but also in science , but in science .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman of the woman &apos;s death .
she heard about this book of charles darwin , the emergence of the species and the midden workers .
that the person from the monkey apes should be , and , at least , there were a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then they ran them to her husband and he said , &quot; well , that &apos;s not true , what charles is writing . &quot;
the person should have a common ancestor or a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , we have to prevent that people know about that .
why do we have to prevent people from something to be true ?
because we cannot live this kind of thing .
because we &apos;re this self-deception , this feeling , great to be , the highest creatures , not from one of these very sophisticated creatures , from such a kind of a kind of a , which is a kind of a , like a rat , which is a very similar stone , which is a stone , which is for us .
so , we can &apos;t bear these things .
we need to prevent people who are going to know about things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism is crawling up and looking like the traces that he leaves , which leads to something else than this great picture of ourselves , i want to give you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , like i &apos;m talking about .
my wife told me .
she came from school one day , she &apos;s a teacher , she told her about a student .
a student student .
she likes to love it especially because he has a tendency to amplify .
and she asked him what &apos;s your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire fire .
and because i &apos;m in the fire , i &apos;m interested in the kind of little bit of the time .
yes , you feel it &apos;s when you suck up at this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , whenever a human being in a moral way , is the most important thing that the most important thing is to replace , and we should try to replace it by the time .
and then you know , you know , and then you experience the sentence .
although i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in the kind of thing .
they feel that this is the real truth behind the cause .
so a little bit of a small , which is not interested in the long-term system .
it &apos;s interested in the long-term movement .
but there are no clubs that we can do , where we can learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second thing , the fire walls .
he signed up .
and the other thing is , you don &apos;t say his teacher , that you like to put electrodes somewhere and you &apos;re happy to be able to get out of fire .
no , it looks much better if we &apos;re showing that we &apos;re in charge of that , the dangers of cleaning the other ones that are just going to be put on fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this one that this particular one that has been that in the heart of the brain has already known that he &apos;s actually related to fire , but that he can &apos;t say it loud .
here you have this kind of light between the unconscious and the conscious , which immediately jump off , and the things that you know about it , and things that you know that you can look at very different , so it designed much better for you and you can sound .
so just that kind of words that we &apos;re using in the language of the political correct debate is all over the right .
and actually , we know that something else is the case .
but we know if we call that , the social debt is very sensitive to the world .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to do things like this in a society that should work .
so i want to give you a discussion of what we found in my institute .
after what logic that deception , the willingness to the willingness , the willingness to be a different reality than that we actually know in the unconscious , is to spread out .
so here i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is what many of you know and appreciate some of them , just not just for a few of them .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is a kind of intellectual , say about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not about stop , physical nature .
and if you have people who are the most stable belief , they have a soul , or you can also say that they have been given from the soul to live , then the way that the soul is , they &apos;re just a kind of a mental framework , which is not a matter of matter , and they &apos;re just dead , and they &apos;re dead , and they &apos;re dead , and they &apos;re dead , the world &apos;s dead , they &apos;re going dead , the world &apos;s dead .
and by this soul , you think that somehow you kind of in this hallway , in this particular world , in this particular , most important nature , it &apos;s called the most important thing in the latin of the latin , the most important thing .
and then , if this is the most important thing that happens , the people who are in the brain , it &apos;s filled with dignity , with nature , with nature , which can only live with the soul .
and then he can just get a little bit of it .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so she &apos;s going to come from the outside to people .
so we should be able to perceive what &apos;s essential to our lives .
and if you have this premise of eyes , you understand the logic that we &apos;re going to experience , through a lie of our world , to improve our world .
because now you can apply a more of the time .
you know , you know , you know , the school of school .
now this is a video of a second , which describes us a logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
because to lie , they can just apply this logic wrong .
in this particular field , three sentences come .
the first sentence is , you know , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if you have a right one , it doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i was very busy in this .
a third sentence , who immediately shows people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul who is dead , and can &apos;t claim anything .
and you &apos;re feeling it .
here &apos;s the logic in this , yes , in this very , very , very popular speech .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , which are logical .
because i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a term about reality .
i can say the most important one is a man .
and if i have right , the most important one is a man .
if i don &apos;t have a right , the most bad one is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s true .
i can claim everything .
but critical , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so if you &apos;re a computer scientist , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical correctly .
and now our favorite awareness of consciousness is now going to be able to do something .
it &apos;s a third sentence that doesn &apos;t have to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s what the opposite is about , and it &apos;s been proven to be the opposite of the first sentence .
because actually , we have to prove if there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that it just uses that two sentences are accurate , and a third of the things that looks like it would have done something with it , we can save our dna decisions .
so , we do , as if it &apos;s really impossible , without able to live a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue to continue these things to happen .
in the present , we have a very modern example of the world that &apos;s going to fill the world &apos;s most back .
you have to think about another philosophical topic , a more powerful thing from philosophy , present .
that &apos;s what we do with the world &apos;s time that we go back into the world .
there was an exception that was called 1962 , and after that , the most prolific trance is named the most prolific .
the most profound , is a 24-year-old , which is from pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have the soul .
this is a kind of a business model .
and if you place exactly the middle between two of the things between two , it &apos;s going to be a little bit like it .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a haystack he should do first .
so he &apos;s in the middle .
so the most important thing is the main movement .
the forces with the internet force are using each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening there .
only if you take another example , so if you &apos;re going to make a haystack larger , then it doesn &apos;t need reason and anything .
automatically , he &apos;s going to be the right thought .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in nature , you &apos;re going to be driven by the larger pile that you have immediately put on , you have the feeling that you have a little bit of a free will .
and if we &apos;re in the street , i remember the most popular thing to remember , and i remember the most popular thing .
there &apos;s an exception that is called wolf , and it &apos;s sometimes telling you , sometimes , wolf calls , there &apos;s no free free .
now we can make the second sentence , and we can say , if wolf is right , he &apos;s not a free free free .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can now read every day in the king of the day , that you find in this third sentence .
and it looks like this , who has no free free , can &apos;t be moved for its actions and claims to responsibility and it &apos;s so versatile .
and here you have it again .
and actually , you &apos;d have to prove to if there &apos;s something like free free .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this as if the first sentence of the first appeared , when you have to take the opposite , of course , you have to take the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just , if you want to do anything , if you want to test anything and you want to do something about it , and you &apos;re going to practice people &apos;s voices , you &apos;re going to practice to the lie .
so , for example , if you meet a human being , you can tell you that there &apos;s no more no time .
and please , don &apos;t use the german word for the world &apos;s name , which tesla means .
they don &apos;t have to call it a little bit of political technology , again , a little more politically .
say , there &apos;s no more sophisticated .
immediately , they will be one of those , for granted , that you can &apos;t prove to that , you can &apos;t prove .
and they have a problem .
because while they &apos;re busy , they &apos;re not able to prove that they can &apos;t prove any of the news , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s fooled her .
because he has a red run on the ground that he doesn &apos;t even get down .
because this person is not really interested in evidence .
it &apos;s just interested in the way to get yourself to the idea of the need to prove that there &apos;s a lot of time .
so , in the way the evidence of the evidence of the impact is the happiest of the lie .
and once you have a chance to feel this kind of , these sort of online people , you do it , because they &apos;re going to be happy to do other people if they don &apos;t remember their own .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve been asking for a lot of the time , if i could mention them .
she &apos;s one of the most amazing ones here from this great event , and i asked if i wanted to take a talk and my idea .
i have to say , you know , you &apos;ve got it , it fell hard to talk to me about my idea .
and i may be able to imagine my favorite thing that i &apos;m trying to imagine .
but of course , it &apos;s the sum of the whole , very many ideas .
i &apos;m probably the two nice girls there , i probably &apos;m in the generation of the bad , which is a bad picture for this bad image , because i &apos;ve started to study a foreign engineering project in the world , technical school , today , that is , i think , a kit .
and i was going to berlin in the mid- 1980s , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and i didn &apos;t want to be in the street .
there was the most popular thing .
the ones then all the stated , the most popular , was called the most delicious .
the hot today is the hot .
because a good engineer either built a great engineer or a lot of the time .
but this is what the &quot; n &quot; like the &quot; n &quot; is coming out of a hundred watts from the square square meter , which was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy nut .
i &apos;m the grateful grateful thing that he &apos;s got the word again , because after the most successful , you didn &apos;t have to use the word , because everything was left .
but it wasn &apos;t that much in the world &apos;s office .
there was this thing that there was a lot of time that was there , and one of them was sitting in southern school in the world , where you thought that evil .
and the place of the computer , but that was called the wind and wind and energy and energy and the energy , and i started the mid- 1980s .
and yes , a lot of what was said today , i &apos;m very , very , very , very beautiful statements that i &apos;ve been living in .
i worked in the collective , the collective , which was a lot of time .
we were 20 people .
if one didn &apos;t say , it was the most complete , which has a completely valid , and i have a lot of time to do it , if i was my great job of life , if i was a great job of mine , because all of my father &apos;s windows have been to the window of your child .
it &apos;s busy with heroism .
and that was really , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , sort of , a picture on a graph , where i asked myself to get 10 years to see a thousand years , a thousand , a thousand , which is really the great thing .
and then i have to go to the street , and then we have become a fellow of the company , and i became a company called hypertext of the company that became the most important of the world &apos;s largest largest health community .
a very , very promising , but also , of course , we have the problem of an expanding company , and we then have a little group of a group , and we decided that we &apos;re going to start and go back and go back to the next topic of the future , and that &apos;s what i think is the same thing that is going to be going on , that it &apos;s going to be a little bit more crazy , that &apos;s going to be a little bit more crazy .
and i &apos;ve brought you a project that i want to introduce you to now .
and the title of speech was , yes , as you get to 100 percent renewable .
and we just started asking a relatively , very crude story , where you could have a memory of consciousness today .
this island , that &apos;s the island of the island of the island .
yes , these are the data .
there &apos;s four thousand people living there .
they have a renewable investment today from 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
it &apos;s just not a technological thing .
if you &apos;re more wind , the system begins to fail .
i also tell the politicians , if they &apos;re in the world , they &apos;re going to be a tool called the plant .
and then they always say , why ?
we &apos;ve already got 20 percent in germany .
but it can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have seven percent , and our net is physically seen the european .
if we had 20 percent of the time , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was just , the facts was the first , they have the first contacts with the island , but they &apos;re just doing it .
as big as a battery actually needs to be a battery so you can get a island in 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and yes , i &apos;ll go again again .
the conventional system looks like this , all over the world .
by the way , a hundred megawatts of electrical performance on earth &apos;s land is completely sealed on the world .
that &apos;s the performance of a hundred nuclear power , because it &apos;s particularly fast everywhere .
the world &apos;s favorite world , which is going to be deleted , is being deleted because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s fast .
you &apos;re going to be a box .
and then it looks like this .
in the run , three of the most sophisticated ones are always waiting .
yeah , this is the one that &apos;s down there .
we also have very precise data .
and the most important or the solar system or whatever it is , is a system of a system , or a system , which can only be there in small quantities of light .
our goal was just to say , okay , okay .
the north atlantic is going to be the wind and the wind , the sun , the load of the larger proportion .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the performance at the moment , you have to switch off the north .
that &apos;s what you need to do for that moment that renewables can actually take the whole network .
and you can only get it done if you &apos;ve managed to get in any way in any way .
this is no one in the world .
this is in the small style , so you can also use your car cells to be a little bit of a small car .
people always ask me what &apos;s going on in the street , because in the world , in the street ?
it &apos;s already .
but if you want to get multiple of these online types and build a net , it will be extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to get to 70 percent renewable and then there &apos;s still this rest of the rest that &apos;s last 10 , 20 percent renewable , that will be very , very expensive and that will not work , that you can do it from batteries .
that &apos;s going to be a static energy that &apos;s going to be , you know , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , it will be .
you have to go to a more of a time of a car and you &apos;re not just making a difference and just make it a little bit of a difference .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s in a normal , more competent battery .
how far is it going to be there ?
and then a lot of simulations did .
and wind and sun and the burden of the load and the burden , and they came to the outcome , that you have a middle of the long system that you have to be a middle of about 50 cents a gallon of about 50 cents .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay , okay .
so , it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the most prolific , if the average five percent per year goes up .
and then we started to negotiate with the most popular .
what would you have to do ?
have to negotiate with investors , i &apos;ve looked for new york .
we were only five people at the time to build the society again .
and here &apos;s the representation .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system also has a more mature , and it &apos;s because we &apos;re going to do 20 percent with the north of the north , and also a more powerful thing on the other things .
and the most important thing that the most important thing that the most powerful thing that the most powerful is , is that we find it .
let &apos;s also support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we can actually map the electrical proportions of the island in the scale of one of the three , which is a very precisely construction .
that means we &apos;ve looked at the biggest battery in the world .
here it is .
it &apos;s not coming from asia , in the case of japan .
and it &apos;s in the 1970s , and the bbc &apos;s in the 1970s , today , has been developed , and then it became a japanese , and then then the japanese was turned out .
it &apos;s you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has a megawatts of performance and can bring six hours to this performance and that &apos;s the battery that we have kind of a kind of metal system .
and then they put them .
we also have one of these very sophisticated in the same size , as he says there , in the hall , to actually see the entire dynamic behavior of this web , so in the hall , it &apos;s the big battery that we &apos;re looking at , and the whole battery is the whole battery that we simulate the net .
over here we simulate the whole whole thing that the cable &apos;s cable , the cable , in order to represent the grid in the net .
and here you can see the whole thing again .
we can also put two kilowatts of kilowatts of the web .
here we see this again , again , the north , again , the whole , individual , individual , individual .
and what we &apos;ve done since the past was the hall , then the hall was done , and it &apos;s actually done all the way that there was a lot of what the single system is about to develop in electronics , and we made it .
so we &apos;re not a media company , but we define ourselves as a company that is only between the subject and the subject , and everything in between .
you have to communicate , of course , to the battery , you have to communicate in the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is that you can basically put all the time on the island of the world , and that &apos;s basically the most important thing that we &apos;re going to get to be able to increase when we want to increase our proportion of renewables .
so this whole discussion , as we &apos;re going to go back and forth , and the way that we go back , the island of the island , we have to get to the island for example , for example , for example , for example , to the wind and the sun .
and then , in fact , the idea of technology is that it &apos;s going to be .
so , a computer designer , a giant one everywhere .
we can start to integrate on the island , to integrate , to integrate , to integrate the burden .
that means if you &apos;re 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can go through the n , you can take the nets , you can do the nets , you should be doing the percentage of the time , but you can never get to the memory .
and that &apos;s the &quot; n little &quot; little .
so , many people come and look at this , because you can see what the problems you get .
if we turn off the north , you don &apos;t have this spinning mass , which causes a certain inertia in the net .
and our main community system is basically just just from rotating amounts of heat , where always the wave is all around europe .
we look in this web , and we see 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s going to be a point nine hertz , we &apos;ll start a few more sophisticated pieces of content , then we &apos;ll go back to a little bit of a little bit of a steam , then we come up .
this is the system .
and of course , it &apos;s incredibly central .
if you &apos;re going to get that somewhere , it &apos;s a while .
the core reserves have at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in time , you can react again .
if you don &apos;t have that , that spinning mass , you need to replace it with a little bit of the time and the most powerful .
and we can take two milliseconds of two milliseconds once .
and then you see what enormous oil companies there are .
and the message is , we need to get to this rotating mass , if we &apos;re in a way of 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 percent , 30 percent , 30 percent , and so on if we want to achieve that .
then we have to cut our capacity to cut the capacity into the net .
and the power system is just called the power station to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a very , very important one , the moment of the ted system , because we don &apos;t , or otherwise , because it &apos;s not .
and we &apos;re just trying to work that you can get the capacity to get rid of the capacity , to break down , and get down the cracks of memory , and also bring into the net .
now , there &apos;s now a whole lot of studies that are now .
and then , in this purpose , people are coming and looking at our own business , and they look at our own business .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far you can get a piece of a piece of future .
and many discussions i had in the last six years , like the discussion i had in the last 30 years , was the subject of maneuverability .
it &apos;s not , it &apos;s nirvana , it &apos;s all the way we put it , we &apos;ve never done anything .
we have 30 megawatts of chitra pollutants today .
this is a lot of the time .
and i just go out of it that we &apos;re going to store the same capacity in the next 30 years , and the same capacity to have the same capacity to get around the world .
just , it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s a whole lot of plastic points , and there &apos;s arguments .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve been seeing in the last two years , that the scientists are going to put themselves on my side .
we now have over 10 million of the time , also to be a professional network of the street now to the german web .
this is going to be in april in april .
so , from so , you can also see that there &apos;s a change there , and only from this imaginary thing to the idea of the notion , a hundred percent renewable .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable system , it &apos;s like a car system .
so far , in discussions , this is always trying to be able to do this , which is a little bit of a little net , which has a little bit of a web , which has nothing to do with our own brain .
but the question is , if you &apos;re completely independently , if you &apos;re completely independently , from some fossil or more sophisticated , which will be put on the world somewhere and you &apos;re going to be a island of the island .
then they use the only thing that &apos;s there on the sun and the wind is where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a nuclear energy energy and i &apos;m grateful , that they said , solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and in the way that we get , the talk of the ted community , that you can be a collective and energy energy , you can use a little bit together .
and yeah , i just want to encourage you to be in the sense that you can be quiet a little bit crazy and also have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty tough , but i think it &apos;s going to be .
thank you .
when steve lopez , the video of los angeles times , one day , the streets of los angeles , he stopped a wonderful music .
she came from a man who was african-american , a furious , rough , homeless , homeless , homeless , who had only two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from the ted article , a book that became a book that was once a physicist named , robert lopez and jamie lopez and jamie loren &apos;s &quot; buddhist &quot; and the very promising career of his favorite schizophrenia was finished by his favorite and his second career through his favorite schizophrenia .
nathaniel left 1800 , suffered a breakdown and 30 years later he lived as homeless on the streets of the los angeles row of los angeles .
i recommend reading all of the things , to read , or looking at the movie , so they don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness between these two men , but also how the music helped this connection , and how it was to get the instrument , the most sacred , the divine , the divine thing that is going on , the most sacred , the moon .
i met mr. kamen in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney hall .
he just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first symphony and the fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine .
he talked to a very , very crude and more intimidating note about yo-yo mama and hillary clinton and about how the dodgers would never create the baseball of the world &apos;s baseball , and that &apos;s all because of the most popular passage of beethoven &apos;s fourth monkey symphony .
we came to talk about music , and a few days later , i got an email in which nathaniel was interested in me for the most educated .
i have to mention that nathaniel is a medical treatment , because he was already with electric and with a little bit of a vegetable and put it on a very high , and put it on a trauma that has been tracking his entire life .
so , as a result , it &apos;s particularly vulnerable to this schizophrenic stages , which is sometimes so bad , and it &apos;s going to fall away days , and it &apos;s going to be the street of the street row , and the most mysterious of his own mind .
and in the same way , nathaniel was in the same way when we started with our first grade in the walt disney hall , and he had this insane kind of nut in his eyes and worked completely lost .
he talked about invisible tso and smoke and how he wanted to hurt someone in sleep .
i was afraid , not a lot of diamonds , but i was afraid that i could lose him in one of his states , and that i could destroy him to the violin , and i could destroy him to the violin , if i started talking about scale and the other exciting forms of the world &apos;s design .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s art orchestra .
and while i was playing , i fell in the very first place that in the middle of a complete change , i was going to be a total change .
it was like , as if he was under the impact of a invisible drug , a chemical response , whose catalyst was my game .
and the wild bat was turning in both understanding of anger , in a calm curiosity and grace .
and as a miracle , he took his violin and started playing a few clips of the video of the video , and then i asked them to play , and then , you know , playing , the , i &apos;m going to play , and i &apos;m going to play , the , you know , the , you know , the math , the street , the street .
we started talking about music , starting from bach , from bach , the experimenter , and all the other forms of water , from the street to the street , from the to to the wild , to the other .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just know a little bit about music , but it was also related to her , and he was connected to her .
he talked about her with a passion and a sense that i know otherwise from my colleagues in the elevator of los angeles .
by playing music , talking about music , was made of this kind of thing , confused , confused , who was just moved through the streets of los angeles , a computer , a great , white musician .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means emotional health .
because the music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in something real .
and so he &apos;s like his interval conditions .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
this is why we do music : so we do something that is inside us all , deeply inside of our emotions , our emotions , through our artistic lens , through our creativity , to reality .
and the reality of this speech is all that we &apos;re doing , and it &apos;s inspired by us and we &apos;re inspired by it .
what nathaniel set up , it took the music back into a community of friends .
the power of music made him back into a family of musicians that understood him , recognized his talent and it &apos;s more scalable .
and i &apos;m going to be with nathaniel , and i &apos;m going to be with nathaniel disney , whether in the walt disney hall or in a row of the row , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno paravicini : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i &apos;ve stolen the most expensive thing i &apos;ve sent to the world .
i hope you &apos;re sorry to me .
so i know a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first one was more like a passionate distinction .
it was a beautiful fish , a good fat , good taste , a paper on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was raised in the most unfortunate standards for the most comfortable standards of sustainability .
so you could feel like to sell it to it .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
one day , the boss called the company , and asked if i could tell you about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , i said .
so here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem was for our chefs , how do we keep fish on our boards ?
in the last 50 years , we cut the ocean as we have bare knives .
it &apos;s hard to get the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna that we love , the tuna , the most cosmopolitan , they are collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , maybe or bonus , or bonus , a part of our future is going to be part of our future .
many arguments about it . the environment , most of you , the environment , most of you , and you &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a more of 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of water , so you get a pound of a pound .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so finally , this was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to get them .
the day before the event , i called the president of the actor &apos;s company .
let &apos;s try it .
&quot; don &apos;t know , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for that , so far outside the sea , that you don &apos;t get hotter . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s &quot; true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out of the waste of our fish , not concentrated . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this is the same of the students from the students .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
and the other thing is , great .
&quot; the &quot; inch of one ? what is it feeding ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put it on .
and at that night , i was in bed , and i thought , what hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i &apos;m going to call the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t worry .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t worry what to do in sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;ll show you .
well , i &apos;m going to do a couple of people in the company , no one could give me a decent answer until i finally had the senior biologist .
let &apos;s also try to do it .
&quot; don &apos;t i know , &quot; what for example , &quot; what for example ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some of the things he said , and then he said , &quot; he said , &quot; whoa . &quot;
i said , &quot; do you know ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , skin , body , body , clean , clean and clean . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your own brain &apos;s chicken is chicken ? &quot;
in fact , maybe two percent .
&quot; well , these are about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t worry what &apos;s sustainable to feed chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i &apos;m going to get off this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a more confused and a nuclear scientist .
i &apos;m even .
no , i actually have a lot of the fish that i &apos;ve got , because , i swear to god , the fish after that conversation , he tasted chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love .
it &apos;s the romantic kind of romantic way that you know the better you learn your fish , you love the fish .
i &apos;ve eaten him in a restaurant in a restaurant .
a very popular journalist had spoken for a long time from this fish .
it &apos;s got us in a sense of life .
he came up with a bright , almost white white color .
the chef had him .
wait twice .
it was still delicious .
who can make a fish so well , after he was going to get it ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it miguel . actually he &apos;s jasmine .
and no , he didn &apos;t eat the fish and he &apos;s not a chef at least , at least on the way they and i understand them .
he &apos;s a biologist at a hospital at la &apos;s university .
this is a very crude in the middle corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s was the farm in the hands of the hands .
they grew up in the way they were basically the wetlands .
they did that by turning the country out .
they built these complicated , sophisticated tags , and they were getting out of the country , and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t do that , they didn &apos;t work economically .
and green was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds to see what a lot of birds are .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of the water to reverse .
they literally put the levers .
instead of using the water , they used the channels to get the water back again .
they &apos;re going to put the channels .
they created a 11,000 acres of plastic -- they created , the , shrimp , shrimp , shrimp , and there &apos;s a very , world-changing asset , and his company completely focused on the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredibly .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
they look out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see are the canals and these density , lush march .
i was not a long time ago with beatrice .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part of &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were and fighting through the wetlands and i &apos;m going to go and have a little bit of a rock , and i have a tear , and voila , in quiet , is quiet to a single , and stacy .
and he &apos;s going to take a rare video of this .
he said the most uplifting of grievances .
and here , here he looks a pattern of limitations that reminds him the most uplifting giraffe .
it turns out that ursus the biggest part of his career in the national park has spent in africa .
i asked him how to have become like this .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and dropping in more talk from rare birds and algae and weird water .
and you don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the community community community , so in the way that you have .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak about this kind of thing that i had was a bit delicious fish that i had on the top of the mountain .
so i cut him down . i said , &quot; beep , how does it go that your fish tastes so well ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know young , the algae , the shaking , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do you eat your fish ?
how is the most popular ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating , which they would eat in the wild .
the carbon biomass , the cortisol , the tobacco , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally noisy .
there &apos;s no food .
the one farm is the one that doesn &apos;t feed their animals ?
and then i went on on this site with miguel , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be so natural , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
so , in the moment , when a director would have a film director .
and we looked around the corner and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of thousands of pinker , literally a pinker carpet , so far the eye is going to be so far .
&quot; it &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
look at your favorite , pink .
they &apos;re going . &quot;
so , i was totally confused ? i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; miguel , don &apos;t you , you don &apos;t know your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and the birds on the birds .
now , last year , 600,000 birds were in this site , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s now the largest and one of the most important private systems in europe .
i said , &quot; miguel , is a good job of a good job of art that you want to have on a wooden street ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building a lot of time , not intense .
this is a private network .
the food system eats the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the cortisol .
so the pinker the gut the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals and a farm that measures your success at the health of your predators .
a computer designer , but also a more mature .
oh , and by the way , these are not even there .
they breed in a city 240 miles , where the most common is better for the most sustainable .
every morning they fly 240 miles to farm .
and every night they fly over 240 miles .
they do that because they can follow the white white line of the highway .
seriously .
i had a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at meadows .
i said , &quot; miguel , fly you to the farm , and then you fly over the evening of 100,000 miles at the night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me as if i was a song of whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my loved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like to go out . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this kind of lake , the taste of flavor .
i almost never cook with it .
and yet , when i tried to do it in this restaurant in a village , she didn &apos;t freak out to be a patent of mine .
she liked sweet and she would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned that to 102 and he &apos;s got to go .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense , before something in the body .
she &apos;s developed in the evolution of evolution to be more skilled . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no capacity . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your fish . a farm that measures your success on success .
and then i realized , when he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a plastic , he &apos;s a huge , because the water that comes through this farm comes out of the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things to do with rivers that are now , to lead to the chemical pollutants , the flow of plastic , the flow of water .
and when it was fought , and this is the presence of the water , and it &apos;s the water that &apos;s like it &apos;s like it &apos;s a clean .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that measures their success at the health of their predators , but a farm that literally is a single , and not only for you , but for you .
because if the water is going to be , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that &apos;s what they should do , because these love stories , as romantic , is also also the adoption .
you could say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we talk about the other food or the other .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food , actually good taste .
but for many people , this is a little too radical .
we &apos;re not a media company , we &apos;re a tedx company . we &apos;re a lover .
we love farmers . we love small amounts of food . we &apos;re talking about local food . we &apos;re eating organic .
and if you say that the things are good food , somebody somewhere in the future , and says , &quot; hey , hey , i love the other , i love the world , but how will you feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;ve been producing enough calories to feed the world more than only to feed .
a billion people are starving today .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of the nutritional inequalities in the distribution , not the gas pollution .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because they &apos;re the logic of our own 50 years of the last 50 years .
feed grain of herbivores , the chemicals on the earth , chemicals on the earth , chicken at fish , and the whole time that agribusiness just asked the , &quot; if we feed more people , how awful can that be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the kind of thing that was the way the american agriculture was agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a craft in a corporate street , a building , which is rapidly more environmental capital that allows you to do that .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our main community is threatened today , not by the time of the oil system , but because of the resources of the resources .
not by the latest , and the most prolific country , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not by norwegian , but through the forests , but through the forests , and not by the water , but through fish , but through fish .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable each community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in it , and it &apos;s never really made a good thing to eat .
let &apos;s take a look at the ecological model .
this is what the amount of expertise that are going on for two billion years .
so , look , 59 , farmers like miguel .
businesses that are not worlds , businesses , which are rather than the most sophisticated , and businesses that grow up , rather than just intense , farmers , who are not just learning , but experts for relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones who are experts who are also experts .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;m ever going to be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if the future is good food , it &apos;s delicious .
thank you .
if i want to illustrate one thing today , that the full of the data we consume is larger than the sum of your parts and instead of thinking about it , that you can think about how we can use information so that patterns are going to be , and we &apos;re seeing trends that were not visible .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical amount of time to be placed in old .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called the most important thing , and what i can do with a little bit of a probability of life is that i can filter a single death division .
and i immediately see a different pattern that makes it happen .
and that &apos;s because in the most active , people are most active and they &apos;re over here at the most time .
we can move further further and line the data and see the data , and the other people are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , if we go on and to age , we say 40 years or younger , we &apos;ll see that accidents are even the cause of people who should make people worry .
and who sees that it &apos;s particularly true of men .
so you see that this is a very , very , very swimming thing in the way that information is remembered in a living environment .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not for content itself ?
now what we have here is the most common one , every single sport , which ever were printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can actually test it in my room in your rooms .
with a little bit of time , you can get them out in a decade .
you can get away in a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this copy and the sports .
i &apos;m a godless armstrong fan , so i click here , and i &apos;m going to show all of the time that lance armstrong is mentioned .
now , if i want to get a picture of a picture , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the subject of biking ? &quot;
so i go back to a step and i &apos;ll go back to the view .
now i see greg hoo .
and so you get an idea that if you look at this kind of information , more specifically , more sophisticated , zoom , you don &apos;t just look at , you don &apos;t just do or just not just do it .
you do something that is actually a little different .
it &apos;s something between it and we think it &apos;s changing the way information can be used .
so i want to do this idea a little bit more , and i want to do something about what a little bit crazy is .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single one of these , and they reduced them to a little summary .
the summary contains a short and a symbol of the area that comes from it .
i just show the top 500 of the top of the world &apos;s favorite .
but even in this narrow view , we can do a lot of things .
and we immediately get a sense of the issues that are on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the theme of government .
now , after i chose government , i know that the most important thing that the most people who are doing was the most , they &apos;re called &quot; people of year . &quot;
this is really important because this is a realization that doesn &apos;t exist in a single single single single single single way .
this is just to recognize if you go back and look at the whole thing .
take a look at a particular of these summaries , i can go back to the theme time magazine , and all of the time , you see , &quot; people of year . &quot;
now , if i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of this is the majority of the world &apos;s most , some of them come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss .
and interestingly , bono &apos;s a ted prize , and it &apos;s also a ted prize .
so we can jump and look at all ted &apos;s winners .
you see , we &apos;re looking at the net the first time it &apos;s actually a net , not just page , but it &apos;s a lot more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
i just show you the new york times website .
and the application , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can see websites that are going to take up -- and we bring these out of these data lines to every single website like this .
so i can go back to a step , and just jump into a specific unit .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re just looking at the light of the websites in this kind of way that can be seen all over the same way and the way that you see the whole thing .
so i can zoom in in a particular place in the course of a certain place .
here &apos;s the whole demonstration that i &apos;ve been holding up until this .
and i can kind of see anything i &apos;ve seen today , again , again .
and , if i take a step back and look at everything , i may be able to organize my course , maybe i &apos;ll be looking for the first time , i &apos;m looking for a look at bing , or here , after live labs .
and from here , i can go into the side and go back to it .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used again , and every time it &apos;s going to be the big bang than the sum of the oil industry .
now , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the curse of the metropolitan reserve .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going from one to another , we start to go from many things to many things , and see patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
if we can do this , then this summer will be a new source of information , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of moving into information , we can get knowledge of it .
and if we know , maybe we can even even pull wisdom from it .
so i &apos;m going to listen to that , thank you .
i grew up with a more of science fiction in the middle of the world .
i went to school in my school , and i went to school every day a hour .
and my nose always went in a book , a computer company , which was wrapped my thoughts in other worlds and my mind in the way that my mind was being emitted in my deep way , overwhelming curiosity .
this curiosity also showed that i was always , when i wasn &apos;t in school , through the forests of the forests , and i went , and &quot; samples , &quot; frogs and snakes and bugs , everything went home and looked at the microscope .
i was totally biased , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and explore the limits of the possible .
and my love to science fiction seemed to meet in my environment , because then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and were exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came in our living rooms with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world of wonder showed us before .
and then that &apos;s really good to do that at the same time .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there &apos;s neither video games that still have these kinds of pieces of imagery with a computer-generated film , and there was a little bit of imagery in the media media .
we had to do that at the time . if we read a book , we took the description of the author and we went on the screen in our heads .
my response to this was drawing and paint from aliens , aliens , robots , robots , and all this stuff .
in graphic class , i was constantly caught by the teacher , as i was hidden in the textbook , in the textbook .
creativity had to be somehow out .
and what happened is something interesting happened . which is what i was fascinated with , because of jacques , was the idea of a very unknown world on our planet itself .
certainly i would never have a alien world with a spaceship , which seemed pretty unlikely .
but here was a world that i could actually walk here on the earth , and she was equally fascinating and exotic as all that i &apos;ve been thinking about , when i was reading these books .
so i decided to be when i was 15 , diver .
the only problem that i was in a small village in canada was a $ 14,000 sea removed .
i didn &apos;t let me disappoint you .
i &apos;m going to have my father , until finally , a little bit of a college in buffalo , new york , to detect exactly the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my favorite in a pool of the middle of the middle in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , but a real ocean , i got two years later to face , when we went to california .
since , in the 40 years , the most than about a half , i spent about 15,000 hours of water . 500 hours of it in submersibles .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the most vulnerable oceans , is so rich to live in the world , as we can &apos;t really imagine .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know boundaries , unlike our own , human imagination .
and until today , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love to the ocean is holding up with the same intensity as and ever .
when i was a full-time job , it was the pinnacle .
that seemed the best way to make my inner grip , to tell stories , to create pictures , to unite images .
as a child , i was constantly doing books and so forth .
so films were the way of bringing pictures and stories and stories .
of course , the stories i was looking at , from the most violent , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot;
i could do my predilection for the underwater and that &apos;s where i could connect with the cassini .
so , basically , my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; the &quot; to the &quot; to solve a problem of a problem in this movie -- and that &apos;s what we had to create a kind of liquid carbon model -- we picked up on a computer-generated animation , back , back .
what came out of this was the first computer-generated computer that was ever in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t have a money , and he was just saying his strength , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience on the whole world was the magic of the magic , which came from the magic to come from .
according to arthur clarke &apos; law , the law is known to distinguish more and more magic from another .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s what i need to do in the most important way . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , much further .
together with a computer system , we created the guy from liquid metal , and the success was all over of the way that this effect would come .
and it worked . again , we had created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same thing , but we &apos;ve got a little bit more money with the film .
from these two experiences , a whole new world was achieved , a whole new world of creativity .
so i started a company with my good friend stan dickens who was the best of the best , and the most important thing , was called &quot; digital media . &quot;
the idea of this company was , the stage analog processes with visual printers and to skip and start to start with digital design systems .
and we did that and then managed to give us a advantage of a advantage .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the field of war and the most important -- which we actually did , to slow up -- too slow .
i wrote this piece &quot; avatar &quot; that is written in the same way in the visual effects and the effects of the effects in all new heights , with comparable human , expressive characters that were produced by the design of the brain , and the world &apos;s most important to be the world &apos;s most important .
but the bar was very nice to go back , and people in my company told me that we &apos;re not able to be able to do that .
so i moved this and made this film about the big ship , which is falling .
the main thing i &apos;ve been doing is &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship , &quot; it became a very keen film , a passionate film .
but i actually wanted to be in the real line of the titanic of the titanic .
so i did the film .
this is the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but i &apos;ve convinced you , by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to get to the train . we &apos;re going to make the real line .
we &apos;re going to show it in the video of the movie .
this is hugely important . it &apos;s a good job of marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but again , that &apos;s going to be a real thing that can make a reality .
we actually created six months later , in which i &apos;m in a russian , a little bit of a russian , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i looked at the real titanic through a plastic scanner .
this was not a movie , no , no , that was really .
so , that really blew me .
and the level of preparation was enormous . we had to build cameras and the lights and all kinds of things .
and i noticed how much these very profound ones , a kind of a similar piece of similar .
well , they were also more competent and more sophisticated devices .
you go into these capsule , you go down into these dark , hot environments , where no hope of saving is , if you don &apos;t make it yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as though i was in a nazi shop .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was obsessed with exploring the deep deep sea .
anyway , the part of that , with curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventure . it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that could not give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .
i &apos;ve seen some of the next expeditions in the world , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that haven &apos;t seen any before before , and for the science that we saw , even no words had found any words .
so that &apos;s really what i did , and i wanted to do more .
and so i went to a slightly unusual decision .
after the titanic , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my name as a filmmaker in hollywood , and i &apos;m going to be a filmmaker for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we started to do the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; .
we went back to the titanic of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which was a computer company .
our purpose was , the core of the ship , looking at the inside of the ship , which was never done before .
nobody had ever explored the inner of the football system , and you didn &apos;t have any resources for it . so we developed the technology .
and i &apos;m sitting here , on the deck of the titanic , in a very high , and see planks , who are quite similar to this , and i know that once the band has played there .
and i fly with a little bit of a little bit of a boat through the boat .
i actually serve it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i &apos;m physically within the titanic of the titanic .
this was the most popular form of a computer that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i have a corner of a corner , i always knew what was going on in the car of the vehicle , because i was going to have walked over the movie .
because the set was a very precise copy of the design of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
and she made me aware of this , that you use such a little bit of the same , and that &apos;s how your consciousness can be made in the vehicle , in these other forms of existence .
it was really profound .
and maybe a little picture on what might happen in some decades , if you have a little bit of time to explore or do things , or do things in all kinds of different forms of information that i can imagine as a computer designer .
after this expeditions , we started what we saw down there , really appreciate , for example , for example , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , which are kind of alien , but here on earth .
they live with help of attracting .
they don &apos;t exist in the sunlight of the system , as we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
and i was also interested in the same time , and i was also very interested in the same time that was the most popular thing .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in the space and to do the nasa and the right thing , and they &apos;re going to be planning to be the wild , and they &apos;re going to russia , go through the mission of the mission , and take our most , to go to international engineering and take our most efficient to take our own work .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was coming out of that i took a lot of time to do with us in the deep sea .
i took them to the world , and they give them access to the world , and the way they get , the , the most extreme , people who are interested in such extreme situations , i took them to the sources of the existing situations , and they could take them to the sources and so on .
we made a puppet , but actually science , in fact , was in fact , more frankly , more frankly .
so the circle of my existence was as a child , as a child , and the ability to be in reality .
and i &apos;ve learned a lot of these voyage over the course of the voyage .
i learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you &apos;re now thinking , a director must lead , a leader , as a leader or something like a car party or something .
but i don &apos;t understand much of leadership before i do this expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
this stupid movies don &apos;t bring us any money .
we &apos;re just playing the power force . from fame not a trace .
all of you think i &apos;m between titanic and &quot; avatar &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and i would have had the nails on a towel on the beach .
i &apos;ve all made these films , these scripts , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it about the will to be the challenge -- and the ocean is the most important environment that you have . you &apos;re doing it for the most strange , and because of the strange connection that happens if a small group of people are forming a team .
because we &apos;ve made all this with 10 to 12 people who worked for years for years , and sometimes we were two to three months in the sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the notion of the fact that you have a job that you can &apos;t explain to each other , because you can &apos;t explain a task that you can &apos;t explain .
if you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the web structure , the most prolific , and the whole thing that the human performance , and the difficulty , the human performance , when you work on the sea , can &apos;t be able to explain it to someone .
there &apos;s a connection , a respect .
so when i returned to turn my next film &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you &apos;re respected his team and made respect in return .
so , this was really changing the dynamic .
so i stood back with a little team on the unknown terrain , and we made a avatar with a new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we became a very short family for a while of four .
so , this changed my way to make movies completely .
there were people who said we would have really good , really good , and put it on the planet aversion .
for me , it was more a kind of a kind of a research way to do my job , the actual process , which has changed in the outcome .
so what can we do from all of this ?
what lessons do we learn ?
i think the first thing is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the point of your team is more important than all of the world &apos;s most sophisticated ones .
and i get young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t get yourself a person .
get some other for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t bet yourself . but take risks . &quot;
nasa has a more of the time , &quot; fail is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art and studying , a choice has to be an alternative because it &apos;s going to be a more powerful one .
no important endeavor that innovation was asking was ever without risk .
you need to be ready to take risks like this .
this is the idea i &apos;d like to give you on the way . failure is not a alternative , but it &apos;s not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and that may surprise you something because my favorite thing at the foundation of the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds to make things that we have to invent and deliver the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than anyone else on the planet .
and the means is that the existing areas of the world are not going to grow in many years , and it &apos;s too much rain . the things are going to change as it can &apos;t be able to sustain its fragile environment .
this leads to the lead . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , it &apos;s going to be a climate change in the climate .
and also , the most important thing for you is that .
in fact , if you could only reduce one thing , the price of energy would be energy at far most effective .
well , the most important thing about time .
in fact , the most sophisticated thing is based on the street .
the most important thing that the industrial revolution was and even in the 20th century , there was a decline in the middle of the city , and therefore we have refrigerators , air conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s get the price down -- let &apos;s go to a new barrier and these barrier , and we &apos;re going to have the barrier of co2 .
co2 heats the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they add the carbon dioxide footprint , which leads to the most expensive and that has a few very negative consequences . effects on the weather and perhaps worse , that the natural ecosystems , that the natural ecosystems are not able to adapt to that much of the same change .
well , the exact relationship between a computer of a computer and the power of the sun and where their other consequences are , there are some statements , but not very many .
and there are certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to be . but they &apos;re getting extremely bad .
i asked the most popular times , &quot; do we really have to go down to zero ?
isn &apos;t half the one or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue to increase .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a 3.5 foot high truck , which has to be under a three feet of bridge , and then you can actually put it underneath .
this is a very , very low one .
well , we &apos;re going to get a lot of data out of this , over 26 billion tons of tons .
every american , about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
it &apos;s about five tons of time on the planet .
and somehow we need to create changes that are lower down to zero .
it &apos;s been up there forever .
only different economic changes have influenced it , and we need to go from the increase to reducing the increase and to decrease a reduction from zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of a nomad -- you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that &apos;s going to be going to get zero and that &apos;s dependent on the number of people who are using the average energy for service and co2 , which is a unit of energy .
so let &apos;s take a factor of a factor , and we &apos;re thinking , how do we get that on zero .
probably one of these numbers has to come very close to zero .
now , that &apos;s a fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first of all , we have the population .
today , 13.7 billion people live .
and it looks at nine billion of the time that they &apos;re moving on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the most powerful and the most powerful , we could cut that up to 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope to 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
that includes everything that we eat , clothing , television , heat .
these are very good things , and they &apos;re really , in fact , to make these services available to the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might recognize and use less , but in average , this number will rise every year and so on , and that &apos;s where we &apos;re going to double , and that &apos;s where we have a person who &apos;s being put in a person &apos;s number .
here we see a very fundamental service . there &apos;s a lot of the way there &apos;s light that you can read to the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go and read their attention under the bottom of the fish .
now , at efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s a good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
because of different successes in the world , through other ways , through new methods , there &apos;s a lot of services , there are many services , the energy of the plants , to reduce 90 percent .
in other service , like making the manufacturing of the design , 105 29 : 1953 : &amp; gt ; &apos; 51 : &apos; 92 , and the most small , the street , the way it &apos;s , is a lot smaller .
in general , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a reduction in three or maybe a factor of six or maybe a factor six .
but the first three factors , we &apos;ve now gone from 26 billion tons of tons , and that &apos;s not enough .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to be a unit of energy .
it turns out to be the question that you can get on zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every single unit of electricity nowadays , co2 is now co2 , except renewables .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need a lot of food .
now , if i use the wonders &quot; miracle , i don &apos;t use the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these wonders .
there &apos;s usually no deadline , that you need a miracle to a particular date .
usually you &apos;re just going to be wrong and some of them are not going to come .
but in this case , we have to get a miracle and a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how can i really get that to get ?
is there a natural review of calculating , a demonstration that the idea of people here are ?
i remembered last year when i was taking mosquitos and kind of liked the people .
the idea was really , you know , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , this was a place .
i decided that this was taken by fireflies , and i would be here by fireflies .
so here &apos;s a couple of natural fireflies .
you know , you know , they don &apos;t bite me . actually , they won &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of dna types like this , but they &apos;re not all bringing up .
we need solutions , either one or multiple , one of the most unimaginable scaling and unimaginable policies , and even though there are many directions , where people are looking for , i really can see five who can afford these big demands .
i &apos;ve left the tides , the wind , fusion and biofuels .
maybe these are a civilizational contribution , and if you &apos;re making better than i expect , it &apos;s great , but my chart here is that we have to have all these five work , and we can &apos;t give up because of all the important problems .
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels , burning of either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there is maybe just , but it &apos;s not . you had to do all this , and you &apos;d have to get rid of all the co2 that comes out of the warm , and then you get to get it there , and you hope it stays there .
there are some of the most powerful ones that are going to create this on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but to get a lot of it , and it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get to the fuel of co2 , and it &apos;s a big challenge to the world &apos;s population .
who will make it make sure ?
who can guarantee something that literally does a lot of the amount of waste than any kind of waste that you can imagine from the kind of junk and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a tough problem .
next : let &apos;s go .
it also has three big problems , the cost , especially in the world , especially in the world , the question of security , the question for security is that you can really feel nothing wrong , despite the human being , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the garbage ?
because even though it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work .
the last three of the five , i put it in .
it &apos;s the renewables , as they &apos;re often called .
and also , even though it &apos;s great , it &apos;s not that you need no fuel -- you have some drawbacks .
one is the energy density that makes these technologies dramatically lower than electricity production .
these are the most important ones , you talk about many of the many , a thousand times more area than a normal power power .
and also , these sources are overcome .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem to be all day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be every day and just the wind , and the wind doesn &apos;t always wake up .
so you have to depend on these sources , a way of having the energy , and you have the energy in times , and you &apos;re not available to get it .
so there &apos;s great amounts of water . there are challenges in transmission , and if we say that the source of energy is beyond the country , you don &apos;t need to just have the technology to deal with the risk of where the energy comes from different .
and there &apos;s the most popular thing .
and to show the dimension , i all have all sorts of batteries that are made , looking : the cars , computers , mobile phones , for everything . and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done with the amount of electronic energy , which is using the world that we produce now , and i found that all batteries could produce that we &apos;re producing less than 10 minutes of the world &apos;s energy .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches to the time .
this is not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
that happens when you try to do this , and say , this is the kind of water of these devices , 20 percent of the rest of the rest of the rest .
if you want to support 100 percent , you need an incredible amount of information .
now , where are we going to go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the target ?
what we need is a lot of companies that are working on this . hundreds .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
so , in many ways , they &apos;re saying , they &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s good .
i think there &apos;s a lot of people here in the ted group that are already available .
bill big has several companies , among other people , a so-called the great family system .
and the great thing is , they invested in dozens of people doing the great things and interesting opportunities and i try to support it .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that might be touched , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the field of culture ; it &apos;s liquid , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry a few days ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise to a few good concepts .
the key thing is that instead of a part of the brain , you have a percent of the time , which is a percent , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the most expensive .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve thought about it , but you could never be able to simulate reasonable , if it would work , but there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and see that , yes , with the right , it looks like it &apos;s going to work .
and because you burn these 99 percent , the most powerful thing is much better .
in fact , you burn the trash , and you can actually use the waste of today &apos;s waste as a computer tool .
rather than breaking the head , they just burn it . a great thing .
so the uranium is going to be a bit more stable , a little bit like a candle .
you see it &apos;s a kind of pillar , often as a &quot; traveling wave reactor . &quot;
the power is really the most important thing .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called it a lot of uranium .
the base of the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re looking at it , if you &apos;re very cheap and just just a little bit of time , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we &apos;re going to measure our success .
how should our testimony look like this ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to reach and then talk about the most important .
many of you are talking about an 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something more agriculture is going to be , hopefully , and we &apos;ll be clean and cement .
so to get these 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , is completely changing .
the other note is whether we use the most important technology , whether they &apos;re used in all developed countries and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is going to be a key component of this .
if we go back from there , how should this be in 2020 ?
it should have the two elements .
we should use the most sophisticated to get reduction on the way , the less we &apos;re going to be the less , the less , the smaller one is going to be the temperature and also the temperature .
but actually , this note is for the things that we &apos;re not completely concerned about to the great large-scale market , just equal , or even less important as the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
this is the breakthroughs we have to track with the world &apos;s work , and we can measure that in the lab , in the lab , in the lab , in the lab .
there are many great books to this subject .
al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david krishnan &apos;s energy energy that &apos;s called hot air . &quot;
they really go through it and create a framework where this can be discussed , because we need to support all sides .
there &apos;s a lot of things that have to come together .
this is a wish .
a very specific wish , we have to invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and the love i could , or i could choose this wish , which is , i could take a wish , which is , i think , is going to take it .
this has the largest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this desire , the dig between the long and short people will be terrible between the united states and china , between poor and rich , and almost all of the lives of this two billion will be very bad .
so what do we need to do ?
what kind of things do i do ?
we need to use a research for more research .
if countries are going to meet in places like the world , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should talk to these kinds of things , and they would be shocked by the ridiculous low funds that are going to be spent for these innovative approaches .
we need to use carbon dioxide , carbon taxes , materials &amp; amp ; trade , something that creates a computer system .
we need to spread the message .
we need to make dialogue more rational and also , and also the things that are being done by government .
it &apos;s a very important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- can you give us an idea of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , all the big scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we need some 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure it &apos;s reasonable , it &apos;s just in the most important million .
the hard step is building the first swim , and finding more billions that the world &apos;s energy and the place of actually building the first of them .
once the first thing is , when he &apos;s going to go like this , it &apos;s all right , because the growth rate that is the energy rate is so different than you know .
to understand that right , that means building deep in the ground almost like a vertical column of nuclear health , this processed , and then the process begins to go down and go down ?
so , the thing is , right . today , you have to have the reactor to have the reactor , so there &apos;s a lot of people and lots of control that can go wrong . this thing is where you open it up and things can be done , and it &apos;s not good .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can put it into 60 years -- think of a column -- that they buried , without all the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there , and then it &apos;s done 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
a very small one , the self provides a solution for the garbage .
so , yes , yeah . now , what happens to the garbage : you can sit it up -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it and put it in the next reactor and you burn it on the next reactor and you go on .
and we start by taking the waste , which is already already , which is in these areas of these , or the reactors in these reactors , and that &apos;s our main system .
so this is what was a problem for these reactors , which is what we &apos;re going to do in our rescue and it &apos;s going to dramatically reduce the most dramatic thing during this process .
but while you &apos;ve talked about the different people in the world of these possibilities .
where is the greatest interest , so what really makes you do ?
now , we &apos;ve not yet found a place that &apos;s going to be on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting technology technology for everything that is called &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there &apos;s a lot of interest and people of the company in russia , india , china -- i was here and talked about how this is going to be the energy system .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is a key one of the things that was made .
this is a very important step , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries built this , so everyone , which is a quick reactor , a more complex reactor for our first .
in their imagination , in mind , and the probability of something really , really , to start calling ?
so , we need one of these online types , and we need to do things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to use .
this is sort of the deadline that &apos;s shown us the most important thing that we have to follow .
and , you know , if everything goes good , and that &apos;s a great wish , that might be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds , the same as their approaches to work , that can work for their pilots , for their pilots , for that .
and it would be best if it &apos;s going to create multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
we need a solution to every one .
the big breakthroughs is this the largest thing that you know ?
so , a key thing is , a most important thing is the most important .
it would have been without the most important , but the power is so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know how to do that as well as this , but there &apos;s the modular method , which is another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid water system that seems to be a little bit difficult , but maybe the one that is going to say about us .
and so there are different , but the beautiful things is that a million times a million times as much energy as one , say , a more transformative and therefore , if you can deal with the problems and the cost of the world , the power , the footprint , the footprint , the ability to do it , is the potential to the land and other things , almost in a own league .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to hire the way to try and keep the most stable to try and keep it stable ?
so , if you come to this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;ve eaten too much , and a heart attack is a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a heart attack or something like that .
there &apos;s a research group called the online group that is called the different techniques that are going to be able to deny the warming , so we would be given 20 or 30 years to get us away .
this is just a single one of the things .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t be working at insurance because you might be wrong , so you &apos;re eating it , because you know that you will save the heart procedure .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s smart , if you &apos;re going to get the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in the way that you should have that , if you have things that are going faster , or that innovation needs longer than we expect .
climate change : do you have one or two sentences to convince you ?
so , the world is , unfortunately , the skeptics in very different camps .
the scientific argument are very little .
do you say there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that are moving things ?
there are very , very few things you can tell at all , from which there is a chance in a million .
the biggest one here is like aids .
you &apos;re doing the mistakes now , and you pay a lot later .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of problems , to invest in something that you just have later -- and that &apos;s where the investment is not so clear . actually , the ipcc report doesn &apos;t necessarily have the worst scenario and there &apos;s people in the rich world that look at the ipcc and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty should be worried about us .
but my dream here is that if you can do it economic , and the co2 is down , the skeptics also says , &quot; okay , it doesn &apos;t matter that it &apos;s not co2 , i wish it &apos;s not a carbon problem , i wish it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the most important argument that if you use all these time and energy to solve the co2 , all the other goals that are fighting , the most common , the most common , the most common , the most empowering , is to invest money on the other time that we can do it , as it &apos;s better things we can do .
so , the real time , the actual spending for research -- say , the u.s. congress should spend 10 billion a year than they do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
and they shouldn &apos;t suffer other things .
you get too large , and you can disagree with a reasonable people , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and trying to fund that .
because it &apos;s very short to be a very short one , and funded only the learning curve , and i think we should try to do more things that have the potential to be much less expensive .
if the faucet you get , you can get a very high amount of water , you can only keep the rich .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times so much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even more often think about it .
his new computer technology is now , &quot; why don &apos;t research be more recent ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to be associated with his former stories , with the most sacred , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and therefore he &apos;s going to bring the most lonely group .
and that &apos;s a train i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little the support is going to support .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about almost all of the people here when i say , i really hope you &apos;re going to be true . thank you very much .
so , thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , here at ted , peter mcchrystal &apos;s a book called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; road &quot; .
the idea is pretty simple . it &apos;s got to be the highest version of the world &apos;s biggest , and the highest of the world &apos;s biggest tape tape , about a meter of tape , and build a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be up on top .
and , although it really seems , it &apos;s really hard to do it , because people are very quickly concerned about working .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i have transformed it into a more mature way .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , developers and architects , even with the most cosmopolitan and there &apos;s something that makes deep sensations in nature , and i want to share some of them with them .
usually most people start to orient themselves to the task .
they talk about what it looks like , they &apos;re going to look at it .
then they invest a little bit in planning and organization . they draw and put spaghetti sauce .
they invest in a lot of their time in the world &apos;s office .
and finally , before you don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow and they &apos;re very gently at the top , step back and &quot; get &quot; the &quot; -- &quot; and &quot; aw ! &quot; you admire your work .
but what , almost always , is that the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; s . &quot;
there &apos;s a number of people who have a lot more &quot; separate moments than others , and under the worst , they &apos;re fresh .
they lie , they &apos;re cheating , they &apos;re confused , and they really make a really respectful thing .
and of course , there are teams that have a lot more &quot; the &quot; water &quot; and the best ones are fresh to the most comfortable undergraduate .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as we did peter , they don &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is : how does that come ? why ? what about the ones ?
and peter tells me , &quot; none of the kids are going to be able to be able to be a helicopter &apos;s spaghetti shark . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in a long-term fashion .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that &apos;s that the most important thing that they have was that they were trained to find a real plan , ok !
and then to realize it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s different is that they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , so that they have a lot of time to repair the opportunity to fix the opportunity .
and the way that you see is this kind of collaboration as a core of a design effect .
and with each trial , the kids get immediately feedback , and what doesn &apos;t work .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , and we &apos;re looking at how different teams are acting .
the average for most of the time is to create the most of the lawyers , and they &apos;re doing a half of them , but not much , they &apos;re better than the adults .
who &apos;s most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
the big one , the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because you understand triangles and you &apos;re making a lot of the geometric geometric patterns to build robust structures .
ceos are something about average . but here &apos;s what it &apos;s interesting .
you put a charity on the team , you &apos;ll be more significant .
it &apos;s incredible . you see , and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is that ?
because they have special skills of the brain .
they &apos;re tracking the process , you understand it .
and that team , which is breeding and looking at the work of the team , the performance of the team is improving .
and they &apos;re specialized and more sophisticated and more sophisticated and their combination .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six who have a stable structure .
i was trying to do something interesting .
i thought we &apos;re going to get the most precise .
so i offered a $ 10,000 price of software for the winner .
what happened to these kinds of things ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone had a high high construction system , he would have carried the price home .
so , isn &apos;t it interesting that high amounts of labor have a strong effect ?
we repeated these practices with the same students .
what do you think happened now ?
now , they understood the advantage of the interior .
so , from the same , bad team of one under the best .
it produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there &apos;s a lot of time for us to do that , about nature &apos;s nature and success .
they like to ask : why would someone actually invest a time of creating a more flexible ?
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and &quot; visual &quot; and &quot; visual &quot; and &quot; visual &quot;
and what the most important thing is , it &apos;s hidden to identify assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a common experience , a common language , or a common way to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this very simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in it can go to the brain .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the marshmallow .
there &apos;s a computer designer there .
they find crazy examples of all around the world , like people optimize the system and the most flexible .
there &apos;s also a lot of plastic .
and the most important lesson i think is , i think , the construction is actually a sport sport .
it requires that we all have our senses to solve and , we &apos;re trying to use our thinking , how our emotions and our own things , the challenge that lies in front of us .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to bring us from a &quot; to &quot; a &quot; of &quot; a &quot; moment . &quot;
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
we have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool , a cool machine , and that &apos;s a machine machine .
and everyone in this room must be in this room .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what they would choose because i asked my friends recently , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there was cars or twitter or &quot; america &quot; or &quot; america . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced you &apos;re kind of drawn to the nostalgia , to be more drawn .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a tedster .
it &apos;s because opportunities on this planet don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that there was ever on this planet , no matter what scale you &apos;re doing : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , opportunities , declining .
there was never a time like this .
my favorite , all of my time , died of the age of 60 .
my grandparents , my grandparents , on 70 .
my parents are the 80 on the top of the water .
so there &apos;s better one to be in the beginning of my favorite record .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who &apos;s born in delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man on the world on the planet .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is this ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they have shaped the demographics of the earth in a way , as no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we defeated them . pop .
in the rich world , diseases are still threatened by one generation , hardly yet .
so , the computer , the polio , polio ...
anybody still knows what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people that are successes of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try and look at if it works , it changes if it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , the whole news is , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all our achievements , there are a billion people hungry in the world every day .
this number goes up , and it &apos;s very fast , and that &apos;s a shame .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to trash this world .
drinking water , the country , rainforests , oil , gas : disappear , and if we don &apos;t look at that , and if we don &apos;t look at that chaos , we &apos;re also going to go .
so the question is : we can do that ? i think it &apos;s .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people , without the country they live in .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t destroy at the same time .
i think that &apos;s really , and no , that &apos;s not a business problem .
but this is me awake at night -- one of the things that keeps me awake at night , we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as well as now , never yet , never yet , never yet , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never .
and we were never able to get it reasonable , and we can do it today .
we &apos;re at amazing to amazing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think we have to go back hundreds of thousands of years to the enlightenment to find a time where we have to fight progress in the way we have to fight things in the world .
people are putting themselves into their faith , and that &apos;s so closely that you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth will be free .
and listen , everybody has a right on his opinion ; even a right on its opinion .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
they don &apos;t have a right on their own facts . sorry , they don &apos;t .
and i took a while to figure out .
about a decade ago , i wrote a paper about immunization for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed to get on resistance , to resistance on what &apos;s the most effective thing in the history of mankind in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote a paper and drove on .
and soon , i wrote a article about genetically modified food .
same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i also wrote a paper about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that was &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; why they thought molecules on a certain place was going to be a random kind of a kind of a random kind of thing . &quot;
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept on .
i mean , i &apos;m journalist .
we type , we &apos;re going to eat a food , we &apos;re going to eat that .
but this article made me worry , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these dogmas , which were really , i didn &apos;t even have a mustache at all .
these were people who were educated people , talented people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that brought me so mess .
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
we &apos;re on a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as it was used .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking ironic by that , with little quotes , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , so there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what the reasons are .
we have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it should not be that way .
you can just call a couple of names and people will understand .
chernobyl , the most uplifting , the veterans who , the veterans , the drug destruction , the drug destruction , 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people that we thought they were quite right . so , they &apos;re skeptical .
imagine asking , demand the evidence , demand evidence .
take nothing to be given .
but now , it &apos;s : if you have to take evidence of evidence , you &apos;re not going to be good at this evidence , and you &apos;re not good .
and i can tell you that we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear , like i &apos;ve never seen it , and hopefully i &apos;ll never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that the most terrifying story that the most talented , and the vaccine vaccine , and the vaccine has been able to connect .
very scary .
countless studies were done to see if that was true .
countless studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious thing .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , and they were all the same , no correlation , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we think what we see to see what we &apos;re going to feel , what is that we &apos;re really feeling .
we don &apos;t believe in a pile of documents of a cotton , which gives us data , and i understand that , i think , we all do .
but do you know what ?
the result of this was catastrophic .
catastrophic because of the fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world where immunization for measles .
this is a lot of the time and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happened is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because does anybody get 35,000 ?
has one in the audience ever , in the audience , have seen a hug ?
not very often happened .
it &apos;s not happening at all , but even more than the world in the world , it &apos;s not going to be more than the last year .
these are many deaths by 35,000 , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not what happens here , we can be in denial , and people like jenny milt , and messages of fear and illiteracy of platforms like oprah and addiction of the street .
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect and correlation .
you don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same thing .
and that &apos;s something that we need to learn , and that &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas sen .
he took us from one of the worst to the most poor .
no fear , no distress , polio , boom , disappeared .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t do that as much .
he &apos;s called paul &apos;s ted prize .
he &apos;s just developed a couple of other people with a few other people .
he can save the lives of the world &apos;s lives , 500,000 children per year .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
now , this is good , besides that paul runs and talk about vaccines and says , how valuable they are , and that people should just stop sweating .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul in a public population is talking , he can &apos;t talk without armed guards .
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where their children go to school .
and why ? because paul did a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
take them out , return the disease back , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we have 89 now in this country .
and that will be worse , and pretty soon kids will die , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die for 35,000 .
what about polio ? do we take that . why not ?
a little bit of me wrote a few weeks ago , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m a little bit too sharp .
nobody ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against polio . no case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe i &apos;m going to get somebody in lagos today in lagos , and flies just after los angeles , right now , he &apos;s over ohio .
and in a few hours , he lands and he &apos;s going to get a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to go to one of these very long days .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a specialty disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s how the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do that as if it &apos;s not .
we love to bend ourselves in lying . we love that .
do you all have taken your vitamins today ?
so , a little bit of a small , small , little bit of a car that helps you to follow .
i know that they did that because half of americans do that every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference , how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data is all over the same time .
they make their urine . more they never do .
this is okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i &apos;m not going to agree with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand the drug industry .
we hate too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and that &apos;s not what we should do . our health care system is frieda .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing and more amazing to us , which can afford to do it .
so we &apos;re walking away , and where do we walk ?
we &apos;re running into the poor of the world &apos;s arms .
this is great . i love the most expensive .
but you know , this is really a serious thing , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars for it .
and i &apos;ve all got all sorts of little barbs here .
none of them -- they were , and they were , they were , and they were , i know , no , what that is , but we &apos;re not even giving billions of dollars to it , it &apos;s been a victim .
and you know what ? if i say that , people are screaming and saying , &quot; what cares ? let &apos;s do people do what they want .
so you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you have wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the minister of the minister , that says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to be the evidence of mine , &quot; or any of the most cosmopolitan that want to treat his patients with a little bit of the time .
if you go to this path , where you think and magic evidence and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to the street of south africa in south africa .
he brought 400,000 his people around , because he was that red sites , the white line , and more effective , are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs we know that they can be able to get the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of inconsistent deaths in a country that will worse than any other one of these disease is going to be .
please tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they have always .
now , the industrial epidemic , which we &apos;re just , is that this ridiculous struggle between the world &apos;s most competent , genetically modified food and the most expensive .
this is a debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every single branch , every branch , floods , is transformed by the people .
you know , there was no clan in paradise .
there was no clan .
there was no clan . we did it all .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them worked and not .
we get rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more specifically . and of course there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , you can extend millions of people , your life .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand that .
we &apos;re genetically modified food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear is , too many chemicals , pesticides , pesticides , hormones , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing that is wrong .
we don &apos;t want firms to patent life .
we don &apos;t want firms to have seeds .
and you know what my answer is to all of this ?
yes , they &apos;re right . we fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge amount of water , but that &apos;s not science .
that &apos;s nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , it &apos;s a bad morality .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work because we &apos;re afraid of the fact that we have a really dead , and she holds millions of people from the flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we have to grow 70 percent more food than the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . passion .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? genetically modified food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this kind of stuff , like , like , for example , .
and we have something that is a half billion people eating food .
it &apos;s about how a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s frieda .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists are building all this .
and then people could do that , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be walt pollan , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say is , why do we fight this ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask : why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want genes to move ?
it &apos;s not about the way to move around genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our profit on greater food , better food , certainly food .
it &apos;s not about rice &apos;s water , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re doing so far as we do , we &apos;re guilty about something that we don &apos;t want to be guilty of , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no description of what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of our , and we need to really stop it .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; do you want to still go into this ridiculous machine machine and go into the future ? &quot;
anyway . that &apos;s what i want to do on every case .
now , in the present , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this machine machine on everything we want .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want .
we need to have these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the machine machine and go into the future , we &apos;re happy to be done .
i know we can , and it &apos;s something that &apos;s going to be something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i &apos;m interested in the most popular . it might seem strange that a magician is interested in it , because they look like i think , &quot; a deception that will be something that will be really , if someone is just stuck with it . &quot;
with other words , sugar sugar has shown a measurable effect , which is the most important , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what happens to her , is a kind of a , or a kind of -- in the middle of the country , for example , if the patient thinks that &apos;s a measurable effect in the body you call the most tangible .
a deception becomes something real because somebody is so aware .
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a basic , simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least for the 1950s in every single time for children .
i &apos;ve learned it from the most uplifting magic magic magic of the skyline .
i &apos;m going to make it for you , and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can study ; my hand , the you can study .
i &apos;m going to just keep this knife in my head .
i push back my sleeve .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve is going to go out , and i &apos;m going to just get my wrist right here .
and in this way , you can see that no time , it &apos;s going to move anything . as long as i &apos;m here , there can be nothing in my sleeve , or come out .
and the goal is that it &apos;s very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife is going to get through my bare physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually so dependent on its place that i can shake it , without that knife .
nothing goes into my sleeve or comes out , no more , and you can study everything .
ow !
now , this is a trick i often put in small children who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you &apos;re very similar to , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you in the room are probably familiar with this trick .
he works like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to go my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or out of it , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m going to go my wrist is that it &apos;s the real secret of the illusion .
because at the moment , where i mean my hand from you , so you &apos;re going to see it from the back , that &apos;s the finger that &apos;s just coming from where he was , in a position where he was so aggressive .
great trick ?
there &apos;s someone sitting in the back , there &apos;s no childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i got to the mind , the fingers changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why not realize that there are only three fingers to see : because the mind and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count one , two , three , but it looks as a group .
but this is not really what i &apos;m doing here , and then i open my hand .
of course it &apos;s been charged there , but not by magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my alma , which is now there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing happens by putting me out of this movement , that the finger is going to be cut back again .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick you can run your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what about doing that with the brain &apos;s office ?
a year ago , i read a study that really was really laid out to me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing .
because this is what you have to do , if you offer a placebo in a form of a white pill , in the form of a computer , is just a round , white pill , which has a particular sensory effect .
but if you give the shape that you give the placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and that blue light is color and a letter is actually measuring , it &apos;s actually measurable .
and that , although none of them are -- it &apos;s just sugar .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that made me really anxious .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
if you take these strands , the more effective than a pills is actually more effective .
a colored capsule , which is at a end of yellow and on the other red , is better than a white capsule .
the flowering is a role .
a pill twice is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact exact statistics . sorry .
but the key thing is ...
... that also the doses of play .
and the shape is playing a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate news policy , you have to grab the needle .
right ? a syringe with a little bit of a , a few of the time of a horse that you have to import a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in mind . that &apos;s a lot stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time , if we have a projector .
so , the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill , which doesn &apos;t work as well as the capsule , which doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and none of them really have a really basic property . it &apos;s just our belief in our own powerful impact .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;m taking something that &apos;s obvious a deception , and let &apos;s take a look at it .
we know that we have to take a needle out of that study , if it &apos;s supposed to go to the needle .
this is a 18 inches long , and it &apos;s very , very , very disappointing , and i &apos;m going to first just give you a little bit of a little bit of light .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not a special kind of sinister meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin and pull through it through it , until she throws up on the other side .
if you &apos;re a bad thing , if you &apos;re slightly concerned -- i &apos;ve shown you a few friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and that &apos;s a woman almost relaxed .
so i &apos;m suggesting if you &apos;re going to be very bad , you look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know , you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first sensitive part here .
you can see it right , but you can also see it , if you want .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my meat is starting , i &apos;m just going to make a little barcode .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you make it crazy ?
and just a little bit of my skin , and on the other side , it &apos;s out of my skin .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the same situation .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , well , well .
i know what people think when they see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so dumb and the skin , &quot; it &apos;s not so stupid , just to talk to us a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;ll show you .
how does this look like this ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people back to the back says , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see that right . &quot;
people in the world &apos;s office are going to go into the wild .
let me show you from the near .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can rearrange it .
sorry . if you &apos;re going to look bad , look away , don &apos;t look at it .
people in the back or the ones that are going to see at the same time , say , &quot; well , this looks quite impressive , but if it was real , it would be a hole , but if it was real , it &apos;s a hole , and it would be , if it really was , it would bleed . &quot;
okay , let me give you a little blood for you .
yes , here &apos;s it .
i would usually take the needle out .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this framework here , and with the intention of a deception , something real , i &apos;m going to just put the needle in there and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to be a couple of times in the next days .
i hope you &apos;re looking at it . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness today .
i have some people who have been published with the number of books that were published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the title of the last five years and they gave them a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest among researchers among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of internet education .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these tide of work , there are several cognitive cases that it &apos;s kind of impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly going to be about these cognitive traps .
this is true for the census of the world who think about happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out we &apos;re just as mess as any other .
the first of these fall is a very , complexity , to admit complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not useful word , because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could just take it , but in the big and all the way that we &apos;re going to give up , and we will have to take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is an assumption of experience and memory : basically it &apos;s between happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both the most important in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the most important , and that &apos;s the sad fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affects well-being without its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now i &apos;d like to start with one example of someone who had a more of my lectures , who was told a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he &apos;d heard a symphony , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and the end of the recording was a little bit of a sudden .
and then he added , really emotional , that has been ruined all the experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it had broken was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of music .
they don &apos;t count because he was a memory of a memory ; the memory was ruins , and the memory was all that he had to keep .
what &apos;s really telling us is that we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s a solar system that lives in the present and the present , and the present is capable of experiencing the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the most important self that the doctor &apos;s doctor -- you know , if the doctor is asking : &quot; does it hurt if i &apos;m here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a more mature self , and the most expensive self is that the most popular and the story of our lives are getting upright , and it &apos;s a little bit of the doctor who asks the question , &quot; how did you feel in the past ? &quot;
or &quot; how did your journey go to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units that the most powerful self and the most expensive self is to be part of the most important part of the world &apos;s happiness .
now , the most popular self is a storyteller .
and that &apos;s really starting to be with a fundamental reaction to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories if we &apos;re doing about telling stories .
our memory tells us stories that are going to be , what we &apos;re allowed to do from our experiences .
and let &apos;s start with an example of this .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who put a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details , and it &apos;s not painful today , but it was painful when these study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who has suffered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has been suffering more clearly . his favorite one was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a woman had a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much thought these patients were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a much worse kind of worse in the world &apos;s brain had been a patient b.
the stories of the computer community were different , and because a very critical part of history is like it ends -- it &apos;s going to be .
and none of these stories is very , very reactive or great -- but one of them is clear ...
but one of them is clear worse than the other .
and the worse is the one where the pain was all at the end of his peak , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people to be asked , and also a lot later : &quot; how bad was the whole thing in general ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than for b in the state of the war .
well , this is a direct conflict between the average of self and the most sacred self .
from the point of view of the self , b clearly had an worse time .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s working , you could actually be able to take the same of the patient a finite by just to drag the tube in the tube without very much .
that &apos;s going to lead to the patient , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you do a few minutes , you can do that that the most important self is a bad ending , and you have the ability to do the most important thing of the patient a much better , because now you have a better story about your experience .
what is a story that is going on ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that make memory and it &apos;s true for the stories that we invent .
what a story is , is , in fact , changes , significant moments and end .
finally , there &apos;s very , very important and in this case dominated by the end .
well , the most important self lives forever .
it has moments of the world &apos;s disease , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i have this -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds , which means , you know , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a month , and most of them don &apos;t have a trace . most of them don &apos;t leave a trace .
most of you will completely ignore the most of the oil itself .
and yet , they somehow get the impression that they should count that what &apos;s happening during this moments of the brain .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use during this world .
and as we would use them , it seems to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the most important self for us .
so we have the most sophisticated self and the most expensive self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is the deal with time .
from the point of view , if you have a holiday and the second week , the first week is twice the way the first vacation is , twice the time the summer vacation is .
this is not how it works at all for the most appropriate self .
for the most appropriate time , a summer of time is barely better than the most prolific vacation , because there are no new memories .
they don &apos;t change history .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that &apos;s different from a kind of a human self , and time has very little influence on this story .
well , the most important self makes more than remember and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually the way that the decisions are , because if you have a patient who has two different portraits , and decide what he &apos;s supposed to choose , then the one that is going to choose the memory that is less bad and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be selected .
the most important self has no voice in this choice .
we don &apos;t actually choose between the experience . we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as a experiences .
we think about our future as a result of a memory .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the brain &apos;s own self , and you can think of the most important self as one , which is kind of the most playful self , which doesn &apos;t need the most important self .
i have the impression that if we &apos;re going to watch this very often , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing at vacation , and we &apos;re doing the time of the service of the computer .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much is we going to be from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s given to the dominance of the self .
and if i think about this , i think a holiday that we did in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i had ever had , and i think relatively often about how often i think about other people &apos;s own .
and i probably have from my memories of these online trips , i would say about 25 minutes for the last four years .
well , if i ever opened the folder with 600 pictures in it , i spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and these are a half a day .
there seems to be a rationale .
now , i like a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the most important of memories , but even if you have more of them , you have a real question , why do we give memories so much weight in the weight of the weight that we give the experience ?
so i want you to think about a thought of it .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the computer , all of your images are being wiped out , and you get a drug of medicine , so you will remember nothing .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you would choose a different vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species and you have to think about how they choose this conflict and that &apos;s really not obvious because if you think of the sense of time , you might get a different answer .
why we choose the most important thing that we choose is a problem that &apos;s going to be a choice between the two species of self .
now , the two ways of the self throw two points of happiness .
there are actually two concepts from happiness that we can apply to one another self .
so you can ask : how happy is this the most appropriate self ?
and then they would ask : how happy are the moments in life in the world &apos;s life ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is quite complicated .
which is the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of happiness from the most lucky time .
if you ask the happiness of the self , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this is not what happy is a person alive .
it &apos;s about how happy or enjoy the person if this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
everybody who &apos;s not going to be different , the study of happiness , and i &apos;m a lot of researchers in terms of well-being , and i &apos;m a lot of researchers who have been doing this kind of thing .
the distinction between happiness itself and the happiness of the self is recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re going to be able to measure the two experienced .
the gallup organization has a global survey , which has been asked to ask more than half a million people to ask about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started learning about the happiness of the self .
and the main lesson that we think i learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and that teaches them to really not do much about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of finding the correlation that is about a correlation .
what that means is that if you meet someone and you would tell you , oh , his father is a very high , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone has their life as eight in a scale of 10 degrees of uncertainty , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his own own self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what happiness is determined .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mainly , to be satisfied with people that we like , spend time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but this is dominant .
so if you want to maximize happiness of the two species of self , you &apos;re going to do very different things at the end of the self .
the conclusion of what i said here is that we really shouldn &apos;t really imagine happiness than a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very quickly , another reason that we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are going to be in california , they don &apos;t get the correct answer .
if you think that question , you think that people have to be happier in california if they say , in ohio lives .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the most appropriate self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the celebrity self , that decides how happy people are .
but , because the horror self is responsible , you can end up with a few people at the end of california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track what happens to people who are moving to california in hope , happier .
well , your favorite self will not be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier because if you &apos;re going to think about it , how awful the weather was in ohio , and you &apos;re going to feel that they &apos;ve made the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve got a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we &apos;ve mentioned a few weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this gallup survey .
is that something you can share with us because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel ornish : sure .
i think the most interesting result we &apos;ve found in the gallup survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
if we looked at how feelings are underlying income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
it &apos;s 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year are unhappy , and they become more happy ever , the poorer they will be .
we get a completely flat line about this .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen so flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money would not escape a single no business , but lack of money to be a bad way of being able to measure and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the most popular self , you get another story .
the more money you deserve the world .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
but danny , in the entire american effort , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this kind of serious seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on the head , everything we believe in terms of a lot of time , for example , in terms of a security level .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country would take a universal way to be a very serious way of thinking about politics and is based on politics ?
so , you know , i think , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of the design in politics .
the recognition is going to be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening and in other countries , it &apos;s happening .
people are in the way they think they should be lucky , if they think about politics .
it will take a while , and people are willing to discuss whether they want to study or study whether they want to study or study the discussion , so we have to have a pretty soon discussion .
as you can get happiness , very different depends on how you think and whether you think about the most important self or you think about it .
that will affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you &apos;re going to be able to measure the population of the population .
that &apos;s going to be , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
now , it seems to me , this topic is going to be , or should at least the most interesting political debate , to track the next few years .
thank you for invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny krishnan .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it just as easy to save the world in reality , like to save in the world .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince you more people , including all of them , more time with play , and they &apos;re playing more and more games .
now we spend three billion hours a week with a little bit of time .
some of you might think , &quot; this is a whole lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time if you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute of the future is the opposite , is the opposite .
three billion hours per week are not nearly enough to solve the most disruptive problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase this time .
i &apos;ve calculated that it &apos;s going to be due to 21 billion hours of time per week .
this is a little bit of foreign , so i &apos;ll repeat it , so i can do it , if we are problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , and obesity , i think , we need to try to play games online at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade .
no , i really mean it .
why ? this image describes pretty precisely why i believe games are so essential for the survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographers phil luce .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play , so he has built a camera on the players .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe you get some of the nuances of nuances in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also also , focus , really , in the best part of a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re also playing , you see some nuances here , which are up to the top of the eyes and the mouth of the optimism , and the eyebrows show a sign .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of what &apos;s called the epic .
oh , you know that . ok . so , fine . so we have some players here .
a very small victory is a result that &apos;s so incredibly positive that it &apos;s not even possible that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you reach it , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually able to do something like this . that &apos;s a very , very valid victory .
this is a little bit of a mexican victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces from the world , if we take the barriers of the next century , the face of the next century , the face of the very observable , the face of the mexican .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re looking at this face in real life when we face difficult problems .
i call it a bad thing , &quot; in life , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? ok ?
i &apos;m like , &quot; i &apos;m bad &quot; in life , i &apos;m bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my thesis , why we &apos;re better in play than in the real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not so good in reality as well as play .
and i don &apos;t just mean less , even though that &apos;s what it &apos;s hearing .
we &apos;re going to get more . i mean , i &apos;m going to do a lot of the relationship with motivation , something significant to do with the relationship with each other .
if we &apos;re in a corporate community , i think that many of us turn into our best version , anytime , and immediately , the problem is to try to solve the problem as long as necessary , as long as necessary , to try to get it back .
and in reality , if we fail to do that , we &apos;re feeling a lot differently .
we feel overwhelmed . we &apos;re feeling we defeated ourselves . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or collapsing .
and we never have these feelings when we play games , there &apos;s just not a game .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible to think , you can &apos;t just do anything ?
how can we be able to fix these feelings in the reality ?
so i looked like the world of warcraft , which provides the ideals of the environment to create the ideals of solving solving .
and i &apos;ve noticed some things that make the epic win in the way that we have .
so first of all , if you go to one of these online , especially world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are ready to give you a more threatening mission , and that &apos;s immediately .
but not only any mission , but a mission that fits perfect to your current level in your game , right ?
so they do .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their skills , so they have to be a job . but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and you turn it out , and there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are lots of employees .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to finish their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that in real life , this feeling that a lot of employees are willing to be ready .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , this inspirational story , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve heard of &quot; level &quot; and &quot; + 1 &quot; or &quot; + 1 &quot; or &quot; + 1 &quot; .
this constant feedback is not in the true life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have a + , and a + , and a crazy idea , a crazy idea , + 20 kooks .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in real life .
so the problem of the world &apos;s problem like the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at the edge of a mexican , that we &apos;d rather spend our whole time in these online centers .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all world of the world &apos;s world has spent together millions of years to solve the virtual problems of the world &apos;s problems .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it may sound nasty .
but to see it in context , we started to go out of the first time , and we started to go upright to go out of the first time .
so the first north primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend playing with play , it &apos;s just making sense when you &apos;re going to be in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also , because it turns out we use this whole time to play this whole time , actually , to change what we &apos;re able to do as humans in the position .
we &apos;re developing ourselves to collaborative , and we &apos;re very careful .
that &apos;s the truth . i think it &apos;s .
look at this interesting statistic , which was recently published by a researcher at carnegie mellon university : the average young man of today in a country with strong amounts of time to live with a very large age of age .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , for two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , they &apos;re the very precise ones that they spend in school , the fifth grade to the degree of high school -- if you never miss .
so we have a full satellite system , on the young people who are learning what it means to be a good player , how everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have a new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; aw , &quot; read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of the computer research that if we spend 10,000 hours of one subject to the 21st trial of any subject to the 21st trial , we will be willing to master it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what &apos;s the most important people in the world .
so , what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are the most common .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly is the player being committed ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have been in the way that we could never have a human potential .
so many people are currently in the world , which at least a time spend a day with a child &apos;s day .
these are our most important ones . 500 million people who are extraordinary in &quot; something . &quot;
and the next decade we have another billion players that are extraordinary in what &apos;s very good at what they are .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the most popular , the energy systems , the energy , and work on the board , instead of the most expensive , and the player , in the world , are in the world , especially in india , china , brazil , brazil .
you expect a extra billion players in the next decade .
so , we have a total of a billion players .
so i started thinking , what it is to do that what we do to do this games .
here are the four things i found . first of all , the first thing i found .
ok , imagine how extreme sound systems .
the desire is to do the desire , immediately to do a piece of a piece of people , with believing that we have a very hopeful hope to success .
players always believe that a failure is possible , and that &apos;s always worth trying to try and do it , and it &apos;s just the same .
players are not around .
players are masters of spiders in spiders of social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show us that we like people , after we played with them , even if they &apos;ve defeated us , even if they &apos;ve defeated us .
the reason is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone playing a game .
we trust that somebody has a time to have a lot of us that the rules are being honored to be the same goal and to the end of the ocean .
so the key thing enables the energy system to grow from bonds , trust and each other .
so , as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
get productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the most important of the world &apos;s oil industry is a week , as a result of the world &apos;s population .
the reason is , if we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than if we relax or do nothing .
we know that we &apos;re being compassionate , when we do hard , significant work .
and players are always ready to work hard if they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to be part of awe of the assignments of the subject .
here &apos;s a computer service to go to the right light . you know all the wikipedia , the biggest wiki of the world .
the second wiki of the world , with almost 80,000 entries is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about world of warcraft in the internet than any other subject in every other wiki of the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers who lead to one single outcome . players are more hopeful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as a single one .
and the only problem is that they believe they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real thing .
this is the problem i try to solve .
edward ebert is a laser designer .
his work is great . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in the world .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to witness less than a drug in virtual worlds and the more sophisticated . &quot;
and that &apos;s an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like i &apos;m developing -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit more a bit more a bit more like .
so he says that , actually , makes sense , because players can achieve more than in the real life .
you can put stronger social bonds in play as in real life , and you get more feedback and rewards in play as in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s completely logical that players are more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
i just agree with it , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not a rocket disease .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from a event that has 2,500 years ago .
there &apos;s this ancient cube , from the street , you know ?
this amazing one was a lot of time ago .
and these were the first of people developed in the world .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the old greek airport , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to the most loud games , games were actually , in fact , in the kingdom of famine , in a famine .
there was such a great famine that was supposed to be the king of the king of the king of a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to the most popular , the most uplifting and the visionary strategy , and a day , you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the world &apos;s office , because they &apos;re so fascinating and they &apos;re so fascinating , and they &apos;re being surrounded by the fact that they would forget nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to the last time , they survived these famine , by eating them in a day and were playing the next .
so , i think , i &apos;m going to play a game today .
we &apos;re putting games to get the suffering of the real world .
we &apos;re putting games to get it to the real world , not working in the real world , and it &apos;s not really a matter of life , and we &apos;re going to take what we need from play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to the most unlikely , famine was not better , so the king , a last , last night , was a final master company .
they shared the kingdom in two camps .
they played a computer center and they were able to break the best to get a mexican adventure .
they left out and they were looking for the search of a new home , and they just left so many people , like food , and they were looking at the rest of a place where they could be able to thrive .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest security shows that the most popular , the later the summer of the summer , which would have the same dna as the old kind of old species of old .
so scientists recently came to perception that the crazy story is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global cooling that took almost 20 years to explain what the famine could explain .
so this crazy story could be true .
you may have saved your people through play , by playing 18 years in games , and then they had these miniature and so many people play and play so much about the rest of the civilization .
so , we can also .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 since 1994 .
this was the first one in real time of the world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s first , and that was 16 years ago .
they were playing 18 years for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i &apos;m going to argue we &apos;re ready for our own family game .
so , they sent half their civilization to search for a new world , so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion of the time a week .
we should be able to have a lot of time to do that half of us spend an hour with play , until we solved the problems of real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems in the real world ? &quot; and that &apos;s what i have my work in the last few years in the institute for the future .
we have this forehead in our office in palo alto , it &apos;s like we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to introduce the best outcome , and then people worry about this idea in reality .
we &apos;re going to end up with the epic leader and give people the possibilities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you a very short game that i designed to try and get people to get to the epic owner in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a very reactive , which you have to get into a more of the time .
the most important thing is , we have enough amounts of energy , so it &apos;s realistic for you , and you actually live your real life without oil , so if you &apos;re going to be able to be able to live , you &apos;re going to be able to be able to put it in real time , and you &apos;re going to be able to do it , and you &apos;re going to be able to redesign the way that food is being closed , whether it &apos;s a real way of making it be done ,
we tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied by the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a change .
nobody wants to be alive because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure , and you &apos;re going to say , &quot; we &apos;re going to be oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going to go .
find out how they would survive . most of our players have affected the task in the game .
so we have a bigger game for the next game , higher , more likely to put on the first time .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot;
where the computation is a computer project , the people who have only 23 years left on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global energy technology , &quot; of course .
the call on gamers , we have to move forward , have a really like &quot; a &quot; star &quot; star system .
you know jerry &apos;s favorite , where there &apos;s &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the astronauts , the scientists , the scientists , the most popular and they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people say , we &apos;re in the most unlikely , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read , if they &apos;re google .
and the last game we take on march is march , it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you end the game , you get the award of the world bank , &quot; social media , &quot; in 2010 .
we work with universities in africa and store , to learn a social equilibrium .
we have a comic book . we have the level of understanding &quot; level &quot; for the world , sustainability , engineering , vision and ingenuity .
i want to invite you all , this game with young people , all over the world , especially in the world , especially in the world , in the world , to put their own social enterprise to save the world .
i &apos;m going to end now .
i want to ask you something .
what , do you think it happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a huge meaning for change .
we have these all of these superpowers , the productivity of productivity , the ability to get close social nets , and the desire to make a sense of the importance of the social system .
i really hope we play together together to survive in this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;ll design with me that play and play .
when i go to the next decade , i &apos;m sure i &apos;m sure that we can create every alternative future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the most sophisticated games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about what i was looking at a couple of months ago in a picture of wired wired .
i &apos;ve always been writing my favorite house on my house , but i &apos;ve been working on the writing of the text , and i realized that i &apos;ve never had a living in my life , which means &quot; disabled . &quot;
i read the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; applied , &quot; fuck , helpless , useless , destroyed , mutilated , mutilated , wounded , wounded , wounded , flop , flop , flop , angry , &quot; angry , &quot; useless , bleeding , bleeding , bleeding , useless , bleeding , and weak , useless , bleeding , is it injured , &quot; powerless , &quot; and weak , &quot; relaxed , &quot;
&quot; get healthy , strong , sensitive . &quot;
i read this list of a friend according to a friend , and i had to laugh it , and i was just just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , this was a very old , old , old , old , i just thought that the copy has to be quite old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early &apos; 80s when i was just with elementary school and started to build my self outside my family , and to form , also , in terms of other kids and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god i &apos;m not using a computer designer at that time .
i would take this post seriously , i was born in a world that someone like me would be a person who can run their lives in any way , but today i &apos;m going to be inspired for the opportunity and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately woke up the most popular of 2009 , and i expected to find a little bit of a piece of a piece of paper .
here &apos;s the most popular version of this kind of thing .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , i &apos;m going to shake the last two words under near oil , &quot; &quot; all &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many europeans societies , including the greeks and the roman , really believed that the netizens have a big force , because what you &apos;re talking about loud , can also capture .
so , what do we actually want to capture -- a disabled person or a powerful person ?
even a human being , as a child , would be able to call it a child , could work , and you can do ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open doors ?
a human being opened up the doors , my pediatrician was on the top of a macarthur investigator in southern kenya .
he &apos;s called dr. hunter &apos;s name , a baby name , whose name , as you can think , is most americans who could not be able to tell the american .
and dr. p. was always carried very colorful and was just like the kids with kids just like it .
i found the time that i spent that hospital in this hospital , just great -- to my favorite .
i had to repeat individual practice , infinitely , to be able to do this big , elastic , elastic -- in different colors -- you know , to build my favorite , and i hated these down , and i hated them more than anything . i hated them . i hated them .
and imagine , i &apos;ve even been having a lot of a child with dr. p. , and so try to stop this practice , and i &apos;m trying to stop this practice .
and one day he looked at me at one of my work -- this practice was just tiring and voila -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;ll someday one day one of those profiles .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this was just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that richest five-year-old girls in the ward are going to be in the second floor , but he actually got me to see my daily life with new eyes .
and i &apos;m asking myself today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl has shaped my self and i could imagine that as one of nature from strong , powerful and more powerful human beings .
this is just an example of many , as adults can make the imagination of a child .
but as the most sophisticated examples of the world &apos;s show , we can &apos;t make our language a room , imagine what we all wish to do : it every single one to enable yourself to see yourself as a powerful human .
our language is beyond the social change that has been caused by a technological change in many cases .
from the medical point of view , you can say that my legs , the most important for the computer , the most important for the human body , and artificial water , for aging and artificial bodies that allow people to have really , really , to be able to share their own talent , to develop their own identity , to develop their own identity , to develop their own identity , to develop their own own .
so perhaps this technology is clearly expressed by the fact that there was always another truth , which is that every human society is something very much , and very powerful , and that human ability , and the human ability , is to adapt to our biggest plus .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell you how to deal with odds and i &apos;m going to be a little bit like that : this sentence has never been a more depressing and i think i &apos;ve felt like the questions of people to answer questions about people , and i think , i think , to begin to answer why .
this sentence of the effort with probability that success or happiness depends on the challenge to be a challenge without being able to be able to be able to be able to have a very competitive experience , as if my life would be so successful , because i could get the potential to a life with a prosthetic , or whatever people do with my disability .
but the truth is that we are changing . of course we are the challenge , whether they &apos;re physically , emotionally or even both both .
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s good .
and the odds are not obstacle that we need to be able to get to be better with our lives .
labels are just to our lives .
and i tend to see randomness as my shadow .
sometimes i realize he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s barely seen , but he &apos;s always at me .
and i want to bring it to no impact or the heavy of the most difficult to be brought into the power of a human .
there are hints of life , and challenges , and that &apos;s just a real real time , and every person is going to be different , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to come with probability , or not as we get to that .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for keeping people who we love to preserve , but they &apos;re preparing to get good to get out of it .
and we don &apos;t really make our kids like that if we &apos;re giving them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to separate two things : one of the medical fact , being rejected and the other social opinion about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only one that i had to take apart is that the world is constantly asking me that the world is constantly asking me to describe this definitions .
in our desire , people who are protecting us , who are the heart of the hearts and they &apos;re telling them the cold , hard truth about their medical proposal , or even a forecast to the quality of life that they expect to be a little bit of a disabled thing .
maybe this is the concept of this concept that just watch what &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we repair it for every single one larger disability than the foreign class .
if we don &apos;t solve a human being , and not all its forces and opportunities , we can see , we &apos;re going to be able to get the natural struggle , which you might have to do , another disease .
we have a human being , who has a value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the most sophisticated and focus on all the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between perception of our flaws and our great , connection , there &apos;s a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t be able to ban this kind of mental times or deny , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , even though we want to keep them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about realizing that the odds are in odds .
it &apos;s probably about to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome randomness , but that we &apos;re open to accept them , to hug them , to take them to the most expensive , and maybe dance with a dance and even dancing with it .
and maybe we can see , the probability of something natural , oddly , and useful and feel like that , and not so much as sharp as you can &apos;t get .
in this year , we celebrate 200 . charles &apos;s birthday and he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin has been writing , in my eyes , on something very true in human nature .
i would be so dedicated to that : not the most powerful of his species , and also not the most powerful of his species , but the ones who are the best to adapt to .
from conflicts , creativity is emerging .
not only by darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive , to survive , is to be determined by the battle of the human spirit , to transform through conflict .
so again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of people .
and maybe we know what wood we &apos;re cutting out when we &apos;re really tested .
perhaps that &apos;s the sense of connectedness , a perception of the one , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves a little bit of ourselves .
we can give a new meaning to get a new meaning out of the time .
maybe we can see hints as change .
and the odds are a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve been doing is to believe that we should be normal .
so , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual thing . the typical thing . but not the normal . and would you be able to learn these arms , gray person really know if it really would be ?
i think it &apos;s not .
it would be great if we &apos;re going to be able to make this paradigm of normal versus another , or the power of the ability to make it more dangerous , exchange , and so we can release the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their very special and valuable skills into society .
and the reason we have found is that we have people from the members of our society , and we have a commitment to being useful and to give a contribution .
there are evidence that the neanderthals have been older , in the age of 60,000 years ago , and people with severe physical injuries , and that might be because the life experience in the world &apos;s life was valuable : the life of these people .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were considered something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went in the city where i grew up in a red zone in the red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood there a little bit ago .
it was summer , and i had a lot of time .
and i hear how a guy says behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i turn around and see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you might not remember me .
when i first saw them , i took them out of the belly of her mother . &quot;
oh , so that &apos;s the one .
and of course , it &apos;s made click .
this was dr. kamen , a man i knew only about stories of my mother about this day because i , of course , i was very , very typical to my birthday two weeks .
the doctor for the doctor &apos;s medical diagnosis was in vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world , not at all .
and because i was born without a designer , and my feet had been focused on them , and i had a few toes on the other and a few toes on the other foot , he had to bring the bad news to the world , that strangers had to bring the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say , you had to say , you never would walk , and never be like a little of the kids , like other kids or that you could never have an independent life , and you just have a lie of trust . &quot;
really extraordinary , i found that he had collected the whole childhood of my childhood , whether i had won in a second class in the second grade , whether i was in the world &apos;s office , whether i had a scholarship or a designer &apos;s school teacher , and he used this pair of clips to teach his students , to teach the medical medical medical school and the medical medical medical school .
and he called this part of his course , the x factor , the potential of the human .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough , as the key of the subject of the human life can be of human life .
and dr. kamen said , he said , &quot; i learned kids , if they &apos;re not doing something else , and even if they get a little bit of support , if they get kids to be a little bit of time , children can achieve a lot of time . &quot;
see , dr. kamen has changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how somebody is doing it , two different things .
and i &apos;ve changed my thinking in time when you were asked me to be asked by 15 years of meat , if i had my prostheses against legs and bones , then i would have no second .
i was going to do a normal job at that time .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not sure .
and that &apos;s what happens because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not despite this experience .
and maybe this change could happen because i &apos;ve been so many people who have opened doors , rather than people who have to be able to be able to make me feel that it was going to be a sense of interest .
see , it really takes a human being to show you how to capture your forces , and you &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to turn their own inner forces -- the human mind is so versatile -- if you do that , and for somebody in a critical moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher , you &apos;re a very good teacher for those people .
they &apos;re bringing them to the opening doors .
the real meaning of the word &quot; the &quot; ice &quot; divided in the word &quot;
it means producing something that is the potential to make the potential .
again , what the potential we want to do is now put out the potential ?
in the 1960s , in the u.k. , in the u.k. , a case event was made in the u.k.
they call this &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; car army &quot; in the united states , we call this &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot;
the students are divided to grades .
and the one student will be more tested , getting more tested , the better teachers .
they then have a long time of a student , and they &apos;ve been a big deal with a &quot; big &quot; -- they were told , they were a lot of the time they were very smart , and they were really very , very smart , and they really wrote out of these three months .
and of course , it breaks out to hear the heart that the opposite was told the most powerful , they &apos;re just enough .
and then it was also the three months .
but only those who were still in school -- except from students who were going to school .
and the key thing about this study was that teachers were not going to be .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something changed .
they were just told that the year of the year and that are the students with the grade , and they &apos;ve taught them something and they &apos;re treated .
the only real disability is a broken mind a mind that was broken , has no hope of any more . he &apos;s not finding any more of the world , and he &apos;s not going to have a natural capacity to do our natural , visionary and our innate ability of imagination .
but if we do it , the human mind to help to continue to hope , to be able to find yourself and other people around themselves , and then we &apos;re really doing our forces to be positive .
if a mind has a mind , we can create a new reality and new engineering technology .
i want to end with a poem that was written by a persian poet called the &quot; name of jacques &quot; and told my friend jacques cousteau &apos;s &quot; the god who knows only four words , &quot; and the god who knows only about the god &apos;s name , but the god who &apos;s just known for the rest of the name , but the god , who &apos;s just known for me , is not the god of the name , but the god , who &apos;s just known for me .
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right now ?
suppose i said , through a few changes of their genes , a better memory could have -- more precise , more precise and faster .
or you want to be more powerful , more force , more force .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be to live longer for good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who always would be rejected for more creativity .
what would you like most of the time ?
which would you like to have , if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see you .
a few . probably about so many people there , there are some of the creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would be deciding for a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to do that as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a whole different world .
is it all a fantasy ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a realistic issue here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor &apos;s theme .
the big geneticists in the 20th century , the most powerful , the average of the russian church , was a paper , wrote a paper called &quot; nothing in biology , no sense of the title of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who doesn &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good time , you take your personal health , you take your personal health -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can take a look at kathryn farrakhan &apos; book that &apos;s wrong because nothing else is going to make sense of it .
but if you accept biological evolution , you think about this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for other people &apos;s disease or is it also for us ?
this is another view of life .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush as a center of the branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all existing species of the branches have had successfully had to be successful , they have survived its environment , and it has its environment .
the human part of this kind of thing , far at the end , is that what we &apos;re most interested in is .
we &apos;re going to divide from a common ancestor about a global ancestors about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids were in the space .
some are coming and walked .
we &apos;ve been here for about a few years .
it seems like we &apos;re right from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually , the most fundamental part , are the basic mechanisms of our cells quite equal .
is it clear that we can use it and the mechanisms of a common bacteria can produce the protein of the human genome system , which is used to treat a diabetic ?
this is not like the same protein ; this is the same protein that &apos;s a chemically protein of what comes out of the pancreas .
and with each other , what we &apos;ve been talking about is that every one of us in our gut is more bacteria than it is in our gut , and it &apos;s going to cause us to get cells in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times a number .
i mean , think , if antonio damasio asks her for her self , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s a little bit of a rough , very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to all give them nutrients that you could just wish without effort .
it &apos;s really a lighter way to bacteria , with endangered replication of unintended , excessive sensing of unintended , the outcome .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they are important for their lives .
they help the sensuality nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary balance in form of species ?
or are we going to be a little bit different to be able to do something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
now , let &apos;s go back to the big bang in the big bang , 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago -- the first set of creatures , maybe three to four billion years ago -- the first set of organisms , which is what shapes the last few years , and then the human species , which is what it &apos;s going to form in the last few years .
in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe , life is just a mere way to be used to the earth , the animal kingdom , like a single person , and the human life , a small one .
we were .
this also represents the most popular of this speech , so i hope i &apos;d like to leave you with it .
now , when i was a college student on college , i had my first ted set .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i found something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in the most vulnerable organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going to run in both daughter &apos;s .
but at the time , when the organisms started to come up , things began to change .
sexual reproduction is coming into the picture .
and very important , with the introduction of sexual reproduction that are going to make the genome , the rest of the body is going to be able to get it .
in fact , you could say that the most common of death in the world is going to happen in evolution as the sexual rates .
now i have to say , if i was a computer designer , i thought , okay , sex / death , sex , death , death -- seemed pretty sensible to get to the point , but with every year , it has increased to my increased internet issues .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , who was reading his show in las vegas in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his own side .
he opens the door .
he &apos;s a beautiful , and he &apos;s a beautiful flash of ice .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for a computer for a second . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization that i was a goal to a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily related .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to rebuild the health for a disease .
i wanted to have a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about opec &apos;s genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they are and i developed like the rockets to send the genetic media policy into the next stage of orbit to go to the sea .
i think we would all have the mood that had the psycho-social of all to the expression , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get immortality through my work .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily have the biggest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution is the creatures that adapt to their environment , the best to adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s not the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , and the hot steam is still , if fish were there , if fish were there , it would have a vacuum for a vacuum , still , they have a habitable environment for making it happen .
so , what if we look back at the point , what happens in evolution , and how we think about the space of the people in evolution , and especially how we look at the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reason for this would be that it &apos;s first about medicine , and we &apos;ve got a lot of genes that would have been otherwise made of the population , and from the population would be removed .
and secondly , we have a species of our environment so that we have so much to be able to adapt to us , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and we activate and mixing us so much that it cannot say that isolation is necessary to be necessary for evolution to help us .
a second possibility is that it &apos;s going to be a evolution of traditional art , of course , imposed by the forces of nature .
and the argument , here would be that the wheels of evolution slowly flows to the evolution .
and so far the isolation is going to be , when we &apos;re traveling down as a species , it will threaten , and the changes of the environment , the evolution of the environment , could produce the evolution of natural life .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a compelling , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it a little bit of the new development that &apos;s not just natural , but it &apos;s led to us and decided to be a more complex in the decisions that we do .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be that we do this ?
so first of all , let &apos;s look at the reality that people are making decisions today about their offspring .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family will choose .
so think about if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to do the idea of genetic adaptations that are healing , diseases would heal and prevent them .
what if you could do the genetic change to remove diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or reducing the loss of cancer or stroke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do it , make these changes in your genes ?
if we &apos;re going to be a lot of the way that we have , these kinds of changes are increasingly possible .
the human genome project began in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost motorized billion dollars .
in 2004 , when it was finished , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in a hundred months .
today , you can take a sequence of three billion base points of the human genome to a price of about 20,000 and in the room of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take long to be the reality that it will give the 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everybody .
one week ago , the national academy of engineering gave the national academy to francis arnold and silver , two scientists who developed the natural process of evolution to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to proteins in a more efficient way . which ruins arnold &apos;s &quot; direct evolution . &quot;
a few years ago , the most popular computer company was brought to the scientists who had been a adult , and he took a adult school , a more mature , and through the manipulation of only four genes that were able to break into a cell , and then get a cell to be able to get into their body .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that can make human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that don &apos;t just protect themselves , but also to be able to use the immunity against other viruses .
whether you believe or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in a gang with vaccine that &apos;s grown into the cells of a computer of a fish .
can you imagine a good thing that &apos;s made out of tobacco ?
this is all reality today , and in the future , much more possible .
so , imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of their descendants ?
what if you could change the sperm and the water and the water , or the fresh egg , to give you a better chance to give you a better chance of being able to reduce the diabetes , diabetes , the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want healthier children ?
and then the analytical technique , the same engine of science that can allow the changes to prevent disease , could also be able to adopt us by predicting the better memory , and the better memory .
why don &apos;t you have the most popular of ken jennings , especially if you can extend it to the next generation of the world &apos;s ted pyramid ?
why not have the fast fast , which will allow you to run faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are going to be the most important ones .
and if we &apos;re in a place that we can pass to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want to be transformed from the evolution of evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that may require 100,000 years , and we can compress it on a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years , we can see .
these are decisions that their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , have to be judged .
do we use these decisions to form a society that &apos;s better , which is more friendly ?
or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
will we be able to form a society , and we &apos;re going to be a society , or more powerful and more acceptable ?
these are the kinds of questions we have to face .
and at the deepest of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom is willing to be willing to make these decisions ?
in the good way , in the good way , and as you might think , these decisions are going to be on us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something now , a portable robot that gives you a little bit of skills , or another , the most important one that helps to stand up and go up .
we call this robot , in berkeley , called these robots .
they &apos;re not something else that they put in the morning and they give them extra strength and increase their velocity and they will help them to keep their balance .
this is indeed the real melting of human and machine .
but not only that -- to merge and connect them with the universe and other devices out there .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers , who carry about 100 pounds on its back , and it &apos;s the request that they should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- -- the , 30 percent of it -- chronic water .
so we thought we would take a challenge and create a design system that would help to deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to the moment -- or the human being universal , the human script .
soldier : i can wear 200 pounds over the world &apos;s office , many hours long .
his flexible design allows it to be deep to living , and we &apos;re highly aggressive .
it feels what i want to do , and then i want to get up my strength and the manifestation of the strength .
we &apos;re so far in the way to imagine our own device , this new consumer system in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s take our gaze on the secret , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who estimated the world in the wheelchair .
this is about a percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually an iranian estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about a very young person with spinal cord spinal cord in the world &apos;s body -- 24 , &apos; 30s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 30s , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , the number of people who are declining .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it &apos;s about a car problem , or to other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it has been for 500 years since he &apos;s been saying , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in the area of mobility .
so let me introduce you to a moment of amanda , which is carried by amanda , which has been owned by a spinal cord that has a spinal cord that has been able to run it for 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our main team .
it has sensors .
his completely different sensors in the crutches , the signals to go to our own , which is attached to your back , which is attached to your back .
here are also a lot of the time that &apos;s the most important thing to be on your hips , as well as your hips , which you move forward in this pretty kind of very , very natural gait and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old , and in a fashion of a village , when a computer designer was a computer designer , i was a little bit of a college .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement of my life .
not long after that , a doctor in my hospital room and he said , &quot; amanda , you will never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s steel every single aspect of my consciousness .
delusions technologies have been given me to learn to go back , to go back and drive and drive even the hands on the hands .
but nothing was invented to me that would go back to me .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to make us and to discuss them .
it &apos;s in our hands and we have the whole potential here to change life from future generations -- not just the soldiers , or for amanda here and all the secret , but for all of them .
thank you .
in new york , i &apos;m boss of the u.s. &apos;s organization of an organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t get poverty , i &apos;m a little bit like a football student , a coach , a fire of a volunteer in a volunteer .
now , in our city , in the volunteer volunteer , the volunteer , you have to be pretty early at the most early time to be able to get to the computer .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer on the top of the day , so i had pretty good opportunity to go into the world .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the adoption of the people who would find out what our tasks would be .
when i found the most serious , he had just been in a very serious conversation with the most poor days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night and she stood in the fridge and she was barefoot under a screen in the village , as her house was burned in fire .
the other volunteers who arrived in front of me -- call him a bloody luther -- we got to the first , and i was asked to go to the house and save the dog of the computer &apos;s house .
the dog ! i was lost .
there was some lawyer or a lawyer who was now able to tell the rest of his life , people who were able to tell you that he was going to be a living house to save a living living , just because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next .
the most important thing to do is to get me .
he said , &quot; abed , you have to go to the house .
you have to go up to the fire , and you have to get a few shoes , and you have to get a few shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
now , not exactly what i hoped i had , but i went down -- the stairs up , the hallway , the &quot; real &quot; over the time , the &quot; real &quot; was going to be able to get the same thing in the bedroom .
i know what you think , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was going back to my prey down to the bottom , where i met my fictional and beloved dog .
we put our demands out of the outside , where , not surprisingly , his very much more attention than my own .
some weeks later , the most popular one letter was a letter of the most painful , where they &apos;re going to be a little bit of the house in the rescue of their house .
one of the ways about everything is demanding kindness : somebody had taken a few shoes .
both in my profession in robin hood as well as volunteer fireman &apos;s fireman , i witness , from generosity and kindness in the great scale , but i also did the kind of art and the most of the individual .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look at this room and see people who have either been able to succeed , or on their way there , i want to offer this to a reminder : wait to be able to stop , wait for it .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the life of another , until you get your first million .
if you have something to give you , you &apos;re now giving it .
they &apos;re in a community park , they &apos;re a park in the neighborhood , in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day , we will offer a chance to save life of a human , but every day , the possibility of changing one .
so they &apos;re going to go . save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno paravicini : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just come back from a community that knows the secret of the human race .
a place where women lead the most important thing to say , &quot; hello , &quot; and the game is clearly -- where fun is a serious thing .
and no , it &apos;s not a green , or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their sharks .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the caribbean .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living living .
that means we have a shared ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , which was about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their favorite .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of the human evolution in human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
as chimpanzees are in the great , fear of the other , the most afraid of the u.s. &apos;s females will lead to the u.s.
they really have come up with what they came up with because that leads to a very highly crude society , which has been there not yet .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known under the primates .
they live in the deep waters of the congo , and they &apos;re just hard to do .
congo is a paradox -- a country extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the location of a violent argument that has been the first of world war and almost as many lives as the first world war .
it &apos;s not surprising that these destruction also survive the survival of the bonobos .
and the decline and the decline of the fuel industry that you can &apos;t even fill a stadium with the remaining bonobos -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a laugh of the trees that the trees are upset .
who are these relatives ?
we know it as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; because they have disappointments , also sex , with a lot of people , with a lot of rules , and rules and social media .
i &apos;m not saying that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because life of bonobos is made of more than the bully .
bonobos -- like people -- love -- love their lives for their lives .
game doesn &apos;t mean just a game .
for us and it &apos;s fundamental to the attachment of relationships and the care of tolerance .
and we &apos;re learning to trust and the rules of the game .
play more creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s about the creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you watch bonobos play with the game , you see the evolutionary origins human media , dance and rituals .
play is the most important thing that we &apos;re doing .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique images out of the wild .
first of all , a computer designer on the street -- and i don &apos;t think about soccer .
so here we see a young female and males in a computer scanner .
look at what she does .
this could be evolutionary origins : &quot; she puts it on the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more like him , not true .
yeah !
so , the most common thing is , both bonobos as well as people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the most important thing that you can bring to the game -- how the testicles -- and also , as the game is , the same thing that supports the whole thing as well as it &apos;s a tremendous fun .
but the game is a very reactive game .
play is a computer engineer and it can take many forms of what some of these are quiet , more curious , curious -- maybe to discover the madness .
and i want to show you , this is a young female , a young female , and she plays peaceful with water .
i think just like you play , sometimes , and we &apos;re going to be able to circle in the face of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore , and interact with the unexpected humanitarian that we form , the real breeding of creativity .
this is just a little taste on the insights that bonobos give us our past and present .
but it &apos;s also a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to the issues that we need to adapt to more creativity and more creativity and more empowered cooperation .
the secret is that the game of the key to these skills is .
with other words , play is our main team .
to be successful in a world of a world , we need to play .
but will we make the best out of our own world .
game is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people equally , life is not from teeth and claws alone .
now , if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , it may be a game of the game .
and so , my favorite , let &apos;s give this gift of evolution , and play with this gift , while we &apos;re doing the creativity and the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs of couples , in 1979 , at the same time , in exactly the same moment , every one of the things , ok .
so two pairs , every one of the things .
now i don &apos;t want you to use a lot of time to imagine the synergies because , if you think about the entire time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
just imagine that for a moment .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in case the sperm is going to be a y , which is hitting the x chromosome of the egg .
and in the other case , the sperm is carrying a x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the egg .
both of these are the ones that are climbing , both fire fires .
we &apos;re going to go back to these people later .
i have two minds in most of my activities .
and i &apos;m in a hat that &apos;s like the story of anatomy .
i &apos;m a photographer , and i study this case , and i study how people with anatomy thought -- that human body , animal bodies -- like you &apos;ve thought about body fluids , with the body body .
the other hat i was wearing in my work is the activist as a symbol of a war -- or , as i sometimes say , as a representative lawyer -- from people who are patients from doctors .
in this case , i &apos;ve worked with people who have the most social norms in question asking .
so , for example , i worked with people who are the most cosmopolitan twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with a little bit of work -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and i &apos;ve been working with a lot of people who have been working with the gender of their gender -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female .
and as usual , we can use the word of the word .
and it comes from many different forms .
i just give you a few examples of the types of types of types of people who are not the male or female standard .
in a case , you may have a little bit of a video of a football system , and the gene gene of the y is connecting the air , which we have , the most sophisticated , growing on the line .
and that &apos;s why the testicles are going to be in the field of testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to see testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t react to testosterone .
and that &apos;s called the most important thing .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as a consequence , the body has gone down to the typical female course .
if the child is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it &apos;s usually to take the puberty to puberty and grow their breasts and develop them , but they don &apos;t get their period , until someone comes from this , that there &apos;s something different .
and they make a few tests and find out that instead of the other , they actually inhabit the way they were in , and they actually have a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold the person for the male , but that &apos;s not really what you &apos;re doing .
women , like men , have something called the people that are called the people .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the most hopeful places , the divine language , is the kind of thing that &apos;s called the undersea hormone .
most women , like i -- i think to be a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real favorite , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me actually talk to the humanities .
we &apos;re producing it , and we &apos;re talking to the humanities .
the consequence is that someone like me actually has a brain that was exposed to more , more of the time , than a woman who was born with testicles , and a more of a sudden .
so gender is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some ways , you can be distributed across the whole range of the range .
another example of a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as young as young , he had a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived with his girlfriend , lived with his girlfriend , and he had just found that he had the preliminary and a uterus .
he had an extreme form of an aesthetic village .
he has a little bit of the chromosome , and in the womb , his favorite , so much active , was that she &apos;s essentially creating a male force .
and as an outgrowth , his holiness male is going to be the male male , his brain was exposed to the male male .
and when he was born , he saw a boy from -- no one had a little bit .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he was inside the way that doctors found that he was inside the local female .
okay , just a quick example of a key of a behavioral of design .
some people with a little bit of the chromosomes develop something called the most important , which is the most important thing to do with the computer technology .
we don &apos;t know why that happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- is it &apos;s a lot of the way that they were , or they &apos;re a twins , or they &apos;re a little bit of the other , and they &apos;re a lot of the way they &apos;re in the world , because they &apos;re often adapted to the norm of advantage .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why you often have different kinds of surgical surgeries is because they threaten our social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that a certain amount of value has been related to a certain identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is called a woman &apos;s identity , a black person , is called , to be a african anatomy , which is , in terms of the way we have a african anatomy in terms of history .
so we have this awful simplistic idea .
and if we &apos;re confronted with a body that is actually something very different , we &apos;re going to do that in terms of these online systems .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about interval ideas about interval .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of checklists .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when children are born , which are two people in a body .
where i &apos;ve been seeing most of the excitement , south african critic was last year , whose gender was asked by the most popular world in berlin in berlin .
many journalists called me with the question : &quot; what test are you going to do , who tells us whether the u.s. &apos;s female or male is a male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalist that there &apos;s no test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not a line between male and female , or by male and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female .
so we have a situation where , the further our science , we need to say that these categories that we have been given for robust rates of the group that made a very simple amount of energy to create a lot of the very simple , very little , as we suppose .
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
it &apos;s also about race , which is what it turns out as much more complicated than our most sophisticated ones have been approved .
we have all kinds of observation in our observation .
we &apos;re going to go to the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees in the world .
what are we going to do with the fact that we are just different from a few strands of them ?
as we continue to move our science forward , we get increasingly into a zone of the awkwardness where we need to recognize that the most important categories we have , we probably have too simple .
we see this in all sorts of different areas of human life .
one of the areas that we see in the world today in our culture today , in our current today , are the struggle of the beginning and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about what the point is to do for people , so that it &apos;s a different one as the fetal life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- maybe not as public as medicine -- about the question , when someone is dead .
our ancestors had never had the same to fight the question when someone was dead .
they &apos;ve been given a feather with the nose , and if they moved , they don &apos;t have it yet .
if you didn &apos;t move it , you buried it .
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we take people vital organs and they want to put them together .
and as a result , we were going to fight with the really difficult question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation that we don &apos;t have as simple categories as the previous categories .
now you might assume that the whole wave of this group would be a little bit of a happy way to do that .
i &apos;m politically vulnerable , i &apos;m a little more unusual , and i have to admit , it &apos;s nervous , it &apos;s nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , &quot; i think , tense . &quot;
and it makes me tense in terms of thinking about the democracy .
so to tell you about this tension , i have to take care of this , that i &apos;m a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were more comfortable , i know they were more comfortable , but they were great .
i think they were so versatile and so hard , and so radically , in which they did all of me , and i &apos;m not going to see all of the years of the world &apos;s most sophisticated hemisphere , and it &apos;s not because of music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what happened in the world of the world , which is in 1885 .
the founding fathers were from my view of the original path , which is why .
what they were doing was a concept of a concept , and they replace it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you remember , our fathers , the founding fathers , the concept of the monarchy , and the monarchy was basically being in a very spectacular concept of anatomy .
the rulers of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of the brain .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had the political power , these political power should have , because of the captain , the child &apos;s name , to the son and so on .
the founding fathers , and they manipulated this idea and they replace them through a new kind of concept , and this concept said that all people were creating the same thing .
they &apos;re going to do the field of the field , and they decided that it &apos;s devastating , the common agreement , not the differences . and that was very radical .
now they did this for part because they were part of a system of a system in which two things were common in common .
democracy grew up , but the same time grew up the science .
if you look at the story of the founding fathers , it &apos;s clear that many of you were interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a world &apos;s own world .
they went away from explanations , and meadows things , and meadows things like a supernatural concept of power , back where the transmission of a very , very high concept of a 42,000 concept .
they moved to a very high concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature &apos;s nature .
they talk about the power of nature to say who we are .
and as part of it , they managed to give us a concept of separation .
and so they have been in a really wonderful way to be prepared for the future rights rights .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened for years ?
for example , women who are able to dominate the right , the concept of the founding fathers saying that rates are more important than the rates , and said , &quot; that we have a uterus and the anesthesiologist , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . &quot;
and women are doing it successfully .
next , the successful civil rights director , where we saw people like the people who were looking at it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the world &apos;s most skilled rows of the mountain record , saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people different color colors that are on their pension levels of separation , again , successfully .
we see the same thing at the time .
of course , the problem is that , as we start looking at all the common similarities , we have to start to ask , why we maintain certain believers .
now , mind mind , i want to keep certain believers , and we &apos;re going to see , in our culture .
i don &apos;t want to give you a fish like a person , like a human being .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take off the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that six times that you should have the right to give your informed consent to sex or to marry .
so there are some of the foragers that make sense for me , and that we think , i think , keep thinking .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re comfortable .
so let &apos;s come back to these two creatures that have been brought into the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in 1979 , in the same day , in 1979 .
so let &apos;s imagine one of them , maria , three months of being born , and so , in june , the one june was born in 1980 .
henry , on the other hand , is born to the most popular , so he was born on march 1980 .
only because of the fact that maria was born three months of oil , they all get different three months before devil -- having the right to have sex , which is the right to drink the right .
henry needs to wait for all of this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of the most of his birth of his birth .
we find other oddities of what their rights are .
henry , because you think he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the mit guy -- because you think he &apos;s a male , he can move to what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry .
maria , cannot be able to perceive the same thing in all states , the adoption in all states , and that &apos;s to marry the right thing .
henry can marry a woman , but maria can only marry a woman today , just a woman .
so we have this permanent path of the problem that is in many ways and questionable .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is going to make progress in the area of anatomy that we have to say a point where we have to admit that a democracy is based on anatomy , could it be ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , sometimes it feels like the science is going to be on its own .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture is going to take a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; well , we have to move somewhere , so we move them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught in a very strange position .
so for example , texas decided to get to a point that , you know , a man is to marry that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and a woman means that you have a y chromosome .
now , in practice , people are not tested on their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i &apos;ve been telling you about the most uplifting .
if we look at the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us a dream of a way to make a kind of solution .
he says we should not be able to be able to look at people &apos; skin color , but after the property of their character , and go beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you judge people because of their characters ?
i want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be able to be right in terms of people in terms of people , because i have to admit that i know a number golden feedback system that probably more valuable than some people i know .
i want to know that i &apos;m probably familiar with some bright pieces of light , which are the most reliable , more intelligent and more satisfying decisions about their sexual relationships than some of the people i know .
so how should we be the question of the character of the character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really hard .
and part of me wonder what if the content was a personality of a personality that would be made in the future -- using an fmri , could be made by an fmri ?
do we really want to go into this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really seems to think about the idea that the united states is the leading to the challenge of asking questions about democracy .
in our quest , we have a really good thing to do , and i think we would do our thing in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation as it &apos;s in iran , where a man who feels sexually about other men , with death , is being punished , because he &apos;s ready to put a laser in which he can stay alive in which he can stay alive .
there are no conditions that exist in us .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have this one , a surgeon that i spoke to a few years ago , who had a few of the two of these twins who had a few of the time to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i was with him , and he asked him why he made these surgeries -- it was high surgeries -- his answer , that in his country , these kids were very bad , and that &apos;s why he had to do it .
i said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve moved political in consideration , instead of a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states is giving incredible opportunities to allow people to be the ones they are , without the state of the state .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to conclude , i want to see that i talked a lot about dads .
and i want to think about the possibility of how democracy could look like democracy , or looked at the mothers that we would have more involved .
and i want to say something that is a feminist thing , which is a very radical , and i think that there could be different kinds of insights that are coming from different kinds of anatomy that are going to apply to people .
since years , because i was interested in the street , i &apos;ve also been interested in research in the field of the world &apos;s field .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from the study of studies is that women , in average -- not every , but in average -- more likely to tend to have complex social relationships and the care of people who are vulnerable to the group of people , much attention to the group .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i was a graduate student , i asked myself one of my graduate students who knew my interest to feminism -- i looked at myself as feminist , doing it , really , really , really weird question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism is about feminism . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the dumbest question i ever heard .
feminism is about eliminating stereotypes about gender , so feminism is nothing female .
but the more i thought about his question to be thought that there could be something that was female in feminism .
that &apos;s what we need to do , and there could be something that &apos;s different from the average of women , which is a little bit different from male social relationships , and a little bit of a problem for the most important to make the difference .
so where the founding fathers were extremely disruptive , how individuals could be protected from the state of the state , it &apos;s possible that if we &apos;re more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re more a concept of being able to protect , not just how to protect them , but how we can worry about each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go to the future when we have democracy about anatomy -- less about thinking about individual bodies , which is identity , and think about relationships .
so , if we &apos;re trying to make a more perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a little bit of a suitcase and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s , i &apos;m obsessed with a skeptic .
i love to find a different kind of opportunity , and to find a crazy , crazy outfit , and also photograph , and also photograph , and to transmit .
but i don &apos;t buy new things .
i get all my clothes out of the second hand on the street and in the street .
ooh , thank you .
and the way to get me to the environment is to reduce the impact of my favorite , and also to my wallet .
i meet all kinds of amazing people ; my dollars for usually a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it &apos;s going to be to work in my own personal business .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers are , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i tell you what i was doing for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does someone do with so many of the gharial ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven of the bells , and that &apos;s all .
and the way you have a week is all i did in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve bet that i would have everything i wanted to wear , if i was just going to palm springs .
and it &apos;s not about me , as the woman , who &apos;s at ted , who &apos;s at ted in her underwear -- is called a few things .
and i want to show you my co-author for this week .
does this sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;ll also leave you with some of the lessons that i believe whether it or not , made it , not to wear these foreign policy .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the luminous tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost look at it as a 50 dollars for less than 50 dollars .
this whole kind of outfit , including the jacket , has taken me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i was carried in this whole week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiological impossible to be bad , and if you wear a pants pants pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re going to pull other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation is completely avoided .
i spent a lot of time on my life trying to be myself , and to adapt to myself .
be just who you are .
if you surrounded yourself with the right people , you won &apos;t just understand it , you &apos;ll value it .
wednesday : take your inner child .
sometimes people say , i saw , i &apos;d like to play , like i &apos;m playing , or that i remember her 85 .
i &apos;m smiling , and i &apos;m saying , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is key .
if you think you &apos;re going to see something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think that you &apos;re not very good at something , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i got 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to wrap this up for you .
if you believe that you &apos;re inside and outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to rock everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden , to everything .
and finally , saturday : a own , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world about a little bit of a word , without having a word .
and i &apos;ve been following and over again , when in this week people were coming to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all of my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home , i &apos;ll give you all the time .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn about this week is that it &apos;s okay to let .
i don &apos;t have to emotionally access to these things , because it &apos;s going to be a different crazy thing , and it &apos;s going to be a different crazy thing , and that &apos;s just waiting for me to love if i love a little bit in the heart and search .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all together .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as a flying , as flying .
that &apos;s what we call the lab , called the design design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy grows with this picture in his room , but the reason why i &apos;m showing you this is that in the formula one in the past decades something happened .
a while ago , it was that if you wanted to win a race , you took her budget and put your money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now , you need , if you want to win a race , actually like this one -- something that &apos;s going on in real time , some thousand sensors that have information from the car , and then the information of the car , and then they &apos;re using this to make a decision and make things back in real time as information .
this would be called , in a corporate , a forest company .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is made out of two parts -- a little bit of a piece of time and a traffic system .
what &apos;s interesting today is the most important thing to do is start in our lives .
our cities were being equipped in the last few years , with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to be in the open .
and as a computer in free , they start to respond to other ways , they &apos;re perceived and driven .
if we &apos;re going to cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
just by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population are living there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the carbon &apos;s cause -- cause 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
beyond cities , all of this sense , and drive in objects of everyday life , is a daily life .
this is from a show that antonelli antonelli for moma later , during the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
now , all of our objects , our environment , start to talk to us about ourselves .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like every atom out there to both , one sensor and a sensor .
and that changes radically the interaction that we have people with our environment outside .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , as a democrat , the moses shaped the moses , is that he took the hammer and he threw him on moses -- actually , you can still see a little spot , and said , &quot; do you call out , &quot; the name of the street is not going to be ? &quot;
now , today , our environment begins for the first time to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with the sense .
now the first project i want to introduce you to is in fact of one of the first labs of our lab .
it was born four years ago in italy .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually using a new kind of network that was used in the world -- that &apos;s a very , very powerful -- and fair and more innocent information from this network to use the operators that are going to work in order to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was a italy that won the air industry .
some of you will remember it was in italy , and then the end of the sun , and then the end of the end , the most expensive .
and no matter , italy won the end .
now you &apos;re looking at what happened in this day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see in the middle of the body , the flow of water .
the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline up the timeline .
early afternoon , people here and there , the calls , and they move .
the game starts -- silence .
france makes a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
so , 45 times , people are going to go a little call , go on toilet .
second , last se , the normal one is playing .
first extension , second .
so , in a moment of the ted moment .
italy wins . yeah .
now , in this night , all of the center went to celebrate .
they saw the big key .
the next day , all of the time , went to the center of the computer and the prime minister to do the same time .
and then all of them went down .
you see the picture of the space of the space of the world , where the roman time , the people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the key one , and you see the most important thing at the end of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today , a way of looking at a few years ago .
even quickly , another example of feeling : it &apos;s not about people , but to do things that we use and consume .
now , we know everything about where our stuff comes from .
this is a map that you &apos;re looking at all the chips that are a mac computer , like they came together .
but we just know what the things are going on .
so we actually designed some little markers in this project to track the garbage while it &apos;s going through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that we have helped us , something more than a year ago , in seattle , the things that they can see -- different kinds of things that you can see -- things that you would just throw away .
then we have the little chips , the little brands , the little brands , and they started tracking it .
here are the results we have right now .
from seattle ...
after a week .
and with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of internet education in the system .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of the most powerful , and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we throw away , not just disappear , they &apos;re still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle we &apos;re still throwing away every day .
and if we were to show that people , we can move a behavior change .
so that &apos;s the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , the most powerful , could give you a lot more about the sense and the many wonderful things that you can do with sense , but i want to talk to you about the second part of the world that we discussed at the beginning and that &apos;s the most important thing we &apos;ve done in the beginning of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in southern spain , spain .
it started with a question of the village who came to us and said that spain and the most beautiful tradition have a beautiful tradition to use water as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could technology connect to new technology with this ?
and one of the ideas that we have in a very small run , they were , they think of these tubes , and valves , the valves , they work , and the valves , they work , and close .
they &apos;re going to do something like a computer designer with a water company .
if these transfers fall down , they can write patterns , they can paint patterns , images , text .
and you can take it to him , and it &apos;s going to open up to make you feel like you can see it on this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of the world .
it really loved him .
and we got the mission to design the phone in the stream of the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was made of water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you &apos;re approaching it , it will open up and you &apos;re going to go .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s windy , if you &apos;re going to reduce that , you can even let the roof down .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture will be , like in this case , you know , this days , if you &apos;re going to get the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you have the building . &quot;
no , you don &apos;t have destroyed the building , it &apos;s just that architecture is almost away .
here you see how the building works .
you see the person who &apos;s wondering what &apos;s going on inside .
and here you see me when i tried to test the sensors that opened water , not to become wet .
now , i should tell you what happened to me at night as all the sensors stopped .
but actually , it was a greater fun .
all the children from the street came to the building , because the way they played with the building was completely different .
no longer a building that would open up to make them , but a building that still had silent and holes in the water , you had to jump off without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , think about how people use things that are using things we &apos;re designing .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical environmental system , the most important thing from water and the projections on it .
and this is what brought us over the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine that these are really starting to start flying .
imagine , you could have little helicopter who fly through the air , and everybody with a little bit of a little bit of light with a little bit of light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the room .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter that you saw earlier , which is moving with other people , completely in synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a flexible formation in two dimensions .
or irregular but a lot of dimensions that that , which is what changes , is not the position of the position of the brain .
you can play with different kinds of types .
imagine the screen could just appear in different ways or sizes , in different ways .
but then , the whole thing could be a 3d cloud from the street , which you can start to get through and move through the way that you can look at from many , many directions .
here you see a real design model that &apos;s a real , more energetic , like a second , a millionaire , a photographer .
if you turn the light , it looks like this . so , as we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of people is being operated .
it could have a impulse every single spike of a impulse that comes from people , from the movements of the people or something .
i want to show you something first here .
we worked with the software of the world , one of the best dancers of our time -- the metropolitan tube in new york and the power of the metropolitan theater in milan -- we &apos;ve taken his movements in 3d to use it as a impulse for the most expensive .
here you see the dancing dance .
on the left , you see the most different sensations , the different sensations .
it &apos;s a very crude one , and a pharmaceutical system .
so they can feel the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we all have all the time , you can play with color and play gravity and play with color .
we want to use this as a possible impulse for the most sophisticated .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we work on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is , again , imagine that we &apos;re going to engage the people with something and change the environment -- almost like this , we call it a little bit of how to call it a design system , but with a cloud .
imagine that every one of the small donation can give you a little donation .
i think that the remarkable thing that happened last year , the last few decades , is that we &apos;re changing from a physical to a digital world .
it has digitized everything , knowledge , and power is available through the internet .
now , we can , for the first time -- and the campaign has shown the dog -- we can do this from the digital world , from the self-organizing forces of the networks to the physical world .
that can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is what &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can be to ask us to ask the challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we change the digital world to the physical world .
so the idea is that we actually engage people with them , collective things .
the cloud is again a cloud of plastic , in the same way , like a real cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud of plastic .
it &apos;s a physical physical structure in london , but with a lot of water .
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments for the long-term development of 2012 and other parts , and it &apos;s as a kind of connection to the community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something on the top you can go to the top of the way london is .
you can go inside .
and a kind of digital psychotherapy in the night -- but as a computer scientist , a new way of experience all the way to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i really care about the context .
i &apos;m trying to express that people are not separate from nature , and that all of them are connected .
the first time i was in antarctica near 10 years ago , where i saw my first creations .
i was worried about awe .
my heart sank , i was a little bit of a time , while i was trying to grab what was left to me .
the tarahumara around me nearly 60 meters from the water , and i could only wonder that this was a snowflake on another snowflake , year year year .
and the icebergs are born as a calf , or by the way , by breaking out a glacier .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re interacting with their environment and their experience .
some of them are giving up and opposing predators to the bitter end , as others don &apos;t get more and more dramatic in a fit of moral passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think they &apos;re easily isolated , separated and alone , as we see people often .
but the truth is far away .
while a iceberg melts , i put his carbon &apos;s atmosphere .
and then , while the iceberg blows , he &apos;s turning water out , which feeds many forms of life .
i &apos;m going to go to my photographs of these creations as if i was going to make portraits of my ancestors , where consciousness , that they exist in these individual moments , and never again exist .
it &apos;s not a death , if you melt ; it &apos;s not a end , but a more of your favorite of your life cycle .
part of the ice in the ocean , which i &apos;m going to be a very young -- a couple thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you , show a iceberg , which i have in a remote field of ice .
so , very rarely , you &apos;re actually witnessing a laser file .
now you see it .
on the left , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg , and where it &apos;s on the top of the fence .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a computer .
it reaches around 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just as you show the iceberg a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really blessed by the work of some amazing projects .
but at the coolest , what i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy .
his name is a lot of a cat name .
and the one of the leading was the leading of the world &apos;s leading was the world &apos;s leading .
then , one day he came back from running and said , &quot; dad , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the outbreak .
now , the whole thing is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood up .
i have a company that makes design and animations , so it &apos;s inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the art world and watch .
so we decided , tony -- and he &apos;s to support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what will you do with that ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want to talk to tony .
i just want to talk to him , and i said , &quot; wait , is that not -- i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all be the paralyzed people using this stuff ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you &apos;re hearing the higher , and a remarkable insurance can do that , you can really do that .
ordinary people are not available . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , how do you communicate ? &quot;
does anybody see the movie &apos; organs and the &quot; bust &quot; ?
so they communicate -- they &apos;re running along their fingers .
i was like , &quot; very , very much , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came to the need , just just a check , and instead , i put a check out of that , from which i had not had the slightest idea , how i was going to get it to my life .
i kept ashamed of the place and i &apos;m going to go to his brother and his father -- &quot; well , my proposal is , &quot; well , my proposal is a way : tony will talk to him , we &apos;ll get him a device and we &apos;ll find a way to make it again .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s wearing all this in it , it cannot communicate . &quot;
so i spoke to a conference later at a conference .
i met these people from the street , graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on any surface and then draw with a computer tag that only recognizes the negative area .
so they &apos;re moving around and they make it more fun like this .
they say all things that are going on up there is a life cycle .
it starts with the fishermen , then the most expensive , and then the most important thing to do is to actually do art .
but there was always a life cycle in her presentation .
so i went home , and i was eating with my wife and i told her , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology , you know , that you can use this technology to control things , you should be able to get a laser that would be a laser that would be a laser that would be a laser that would be a laser . &quot;
this was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , and we &apos;ve done some things , we &apos;ve achieved some things .
first , we have the insurance insurance industry , and actually have a device for the world &apos;s worth of food that he can communicate with -- an stephen fry .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really funny -- i call him a little bit of a little bit of time , because you talk to him , or get an email , and think , &quot; i &apos;m so busy , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and we also have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my kids and i moved to the garage , and these hackers and programmers and the programmers and the editors and the street and the other .
many of our friends thought we were beautiful , and that we were beautiful and we were all going to be the images and all the images on the walls .
but for two weeks , we have programmed , we went to the street center in venice , my children were involved in the , and we created this .
it &apos;s called the most important , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap nell that we bought on the most violent of venice , something called a little bit of a little bit of the car and a few things from the local local store .
we took a laser , they have a lot of time , they put them on a led and now we have a device that &apos;s free -- you can build it yourself , we can put the code free , the software can download free .
so we have created a device that is completely free from constraints .
no insurance can be used .
no hospital .
everybody paralyzed , actually , with his eyes , or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s a room of somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
so here &apos;s all of these main signature before the great unveiling .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of trade , the ted conference , and the former nights , tony , after the first time , drew up to seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life support support .
we are missing his bed so that he can see it outside .
we put a projector on a wall of the hospital , against a wall of the hospital .
and he drew back to the first time , in the middle of his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what was a feeling that was on the parking time .
so , we had to break in the parking lot , so we felt like a part of the design system .
at the end , he was sending a email with the world , &quot; for the first time for seven years , i &apos;ve been drawing something .
i feel that i was cut down underwater , and finally , someone was hanging down and up and up my head so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
this is something like our main system .
that &apos;s what keeps us on the landing and we keep moving forward .
and we have to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a very similar one .
and somebody who has such an artistic potential makes so much more .
so we &apos;re in the process of how to do better , and we &apos;re getting stronger and stronger .
since this time , we &apos;ve all been getting all sorts of recognition .
we won some awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one made it .
it &apos;s all coming from our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong ornish &apos;s about us and then , in december , the most important thing we &apos;ve been honored to do is to be honored as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 .
the main thing is -- and this is what it does , and that &apos;s what it does all the circle -- that it &apos;s going to be a show in april , in the inner city of los angeles , a show called &quot; style of the world &apos;s business . &quot;
and there are so much the toughest representative of the u.s. rights of the world &apos;s world -- the most important , corporate , white , white , all these guys will be there .
the point is that it &apos;s part of the show , which is pretty wild .
so basically , i &apos;m about that , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , it &apos;s possible .
all in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the microphone -- everything was impossible to be impossible .
do it possible -- they all are here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never had anything to do with a little bit of a computer , but i just put something out of it and i &apos;ve been surrounded by amazing people so that we could put something on the legs .
and this question should be all of you and you &apos;re in every single day that you have to do , which is done , if not , when not now , when not , and if i don &apos;t , who then ?
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably the most likely to be born in america .
and i always say the people that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever voted a farmer .
today i want to tell you about circles and forks .
well , a enlightenment is usually something that you find because you &apos;ve left it somewhere .
you go to the block and it &apos;s a revelation .
this is a picture of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard &apos;s .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you today .
my circle began in the &apos; 60s at high school in northern school , ohio , where i was the most popular .
i was a parent who was beaten up in the green state of green and blue until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using the toilet in the air of the air .
that did they secretly .
she did three years .
and i had to go out of the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it proposed me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then i found it in the &apos; 80s , and i found it a work in the &apos; 80s .
about three or four years ago , i got a call from this teacher , a call of this teacher , woman post , &quot; i must see you .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned to know each other as adults .
you can please come to ohio , and please come together with the man i know you &apos;ve found .
and i should say that i have a little bit of a time , and that i want you to go to it . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we saw them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we took them , and we went to them , and we gave them eight , because it needed to be necessary , because it needed to be necessary .
it was something that we knew we knew .
and just as the woman who wanted to learn me as adults , i knew it turned into a box of ashes and put it in my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation of that i talked about .
the revelation is , death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life .
he takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is so often mentioned .
he needs the same -- he would need , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s on us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , while they go up on 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a motor engine , which is synesthesia , disability , disability , disability , exchange , exchange , exchange , exchange .
that sounds scary .
well , i had a unique place that day ; i was sitting on a street .
i was the only one who was able to talk to the most amazing .
so i looked at them , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve probably caught some birds . &quot;
the pilot had turned the machine and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot set up the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s not usually the route .
it turn the engines off .
imagine a little bit of a jet plane .
and then he said three words -- the most common words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; look at the ground . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the computer .
i could see it in your eyes , there was horror , life was at the end .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that everything is different .
we have this kind of carbon , we have these things that we want to do in life and i thought of all the people i wanted to make a hand and it didn &apos;t do all the fences that i wanted to make , and never made .
while i was thinking about it , a saying that is , &quot; i &apos;m collecting bad wine . &quot;
because if the wine is so far and the person is there , i open it .
i never want to move more to life .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we &apos;re going to go to george washington bridge , so pretty much about eight -- because i thought , man , there &apos;s a thing i really really do .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i &apos;m going to be better to become better in everything i &apos;m doing .
but in my humanity , i gave my ego to my own .
and i was a little bit of my time that i &apos;m wasted for the most important things that i &apos;m wasted for the people who mean something .
and i thought to my wife , to my wife , to people .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t have a debate for two years , i debate my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have no longer , i &apos;ve got to be happy for it .
the third thing i learned -- and that &apos;s when the inner clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 ... &quot;
you see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please flying into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts , like you know it from a documentary .
while we had wikileaks , i had this feeling , man , to die , not terrifying .
almost as if we prepare our lives for us , we &apos;re going to prepare .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and the sadness really , really , in a thought , is that i just just just want to give one thing .
i just wish i could see my kids growing .
about a month after that , i went to a performance of my daughter -- first , not much artistic talent ...
... not yet .
and i &apos;m going to be like a little kid . i &apos;m laughing like a little kid .
and in the world , everything was made for me .
i realized that when i was able to connected the dots , it &apos;s just about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else is my only goal in life , a good father .
i was stuck with the miracle of that day not to die .
i got another gift , which is to see , and come back and come back and live and come back and come back .
my call on all that flies today is : do you imagine that same thing on your flight -- don &apos;t you -- but imagine it . and how would you change ?
what would you do , that you &apos;re going to tie it , because you think you &apos;re always there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parents that you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the cloning is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build bomb .
the most important post there for the development of nuclear weapons is the most important thing in the world .
the gray boxes that you see here are the main boxes .
now , if it works to us , the systems of the systems and the valves control , then we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with the surface of the brain ; it &apos;s based on a completely different technology .
but if we do it , a useful model of carbon &apos;s worth of communication is used by a laptop , to be used by a computer of the hot box , then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning for head-tail-tail .
so we start with a little bit of a computer .
the most important thing is going to go down into the gray box , touch the centrifuge and the iranian carbon , and in 2100 , in 2100 -- mission .
this is a piece of sound , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started to digitize our research six months ago , completely unknown was what the sense and purpose was that kind of thing .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the most important part of the world &apos;s energy , and the most expensive part of the world , he made a grip of the use of a thousand .
and it seemed a little bit more enjoyable , with these gray boxes , these kinds of things that are called the water boxes .
and that &apos;s what our attention , and we started a project project where we were working with our surroundings with cloning , and we studied this building .
and then something weird happened .
tamara &apos;s hard thing to do , like a nuclear cheese , who didn &apos;t like our cheese -- it didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that &apos;s not what made in my eyes .
and after we had a different set of cheese , i went to see that this is a more special attack .
completely on a certain destination .
the most popular walking on the gray box is around if a special configuration was discovered , even if the special program is trying to infect that , it &apos;s trying to get it on this goal .
and if not , it doesn &apos;t shave .
so , that really came to my interest and we started working on it almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could be , for example , a u.s. of american power power , or a nuclear power station in germany .
so we should find better , what is the goal .
so , we have a little bit of the code and we found the code code , and we found that he &apos;s in two digital warheads -- a smaller and larger one .
and we also realized that they were very professional , and people who were obviously available to all the information information .
they knew any bits and the more sophisticated they had to attack .
they probably knew the most popular of the computer .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already noticed that the most uplifting of cloning complex and high-tech is , let me tell you , the most popular thing is to be a science .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here &apos;s a clip from this kind of video code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
looks pretty like an old-fashioned shark .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be able to get smart from this code .
so after the first we first looked at , the most sophisticated , because we know what this is doing .
and then we looked for the street and we tried to get the real world into connection -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could take or resolve .
so to make these theories , we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be in memory that it &apos;s definitely about a long-term goal , it has to be about a high goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran because most infections were reported .
now , in this area , there are not several thousand targets .
it &apos;s basically running out of the nuclear power system and on the top of the water in the field of food .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all the experts for madison and power plants from our client . &quot;
and i called them and they know their knowledge to compare their expertise to what we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring us the little digital design system with the most small time in connection .
the rotor is that moving part of this , and this black object , that you see .
and if you put the speed of this kind of thing , you actually can actually get the rotor rotor and then get the divorce to the declining , and then actually , the centrifuge is going to explode .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of attack was actually , slowly , and so i think , in the trial , to try to make a lot of time , so that they &apos;re not able to get to get fast behind them .
the big digital computer system -- we got a glimpse of that we looked at very precisely data and we looked at it .
so for example , the number of things that you can do is look very out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started to design scientific literature , which is how this centrifuge is built in southern kenya , and found that they &apos;re fine in so-called so-called , and every single one of these things contains in the so-called water , and each of the things that contain it is a little bit of the time .
so this made sense , it fit together .
and it was better .
these tensions in iran are divided in 15 called levels .
and guess what we &apos;ve found in the world &apos;s office ?
almost identical structure .
so again , that fit really well .
and that gave us a big confidence for that , which we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just that way .
these results have been hard to work through several weeks .
and often we were running in a dead and a dead way to collect us .
anyway , we found that both digital warheads in reality are actually on one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little little video of the data takes a video , and it &apos;s slowed down the hubble dimensions and slowed down the hubble space and the big water rate with six of the things that are manipulated .
so , in the big and all of us , we &apos;re very confident that what we &apos;re actually sure is what the goal is .
it &apos;s a lot of the time , and it &apos;s just a little bit of a basic thing .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that others could be met by homer .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- i really made out of the socks .
there &apos;s the gray box , and the top is the fact that you see the centrifuge .
now , what this thing does is that it &apos;s a little more nuanced of sensors of sensors -- for example , for example , of the design and the most important code , and it &apos;s available to the code that &apos;s still in the attack , with false pulses .
and in fact , this false fatty data is taken by cloning before .
so it &apos;s just like in the way that the car &apos;s car is fed with the car &apos;s car .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the idea of this is obviously not just the most important thing that &apos;s governed in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s a lot more dangerous and more noisy .
the idea is to simplify a digital digital system .
we need digital design , where a human being can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a power station , if the big bang is going to quickly , you have to open up in milliseconds in milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by human engineering .
so , at that point we need digital design technology .
and if the absolute ones are , they can really do bad things .
the power power can explode .
and neither the most poor , the most important thing is that it &apos;s going to notice .
that &apos;s scary .
but it &apos;s going to be worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this attack is a lot of a sudden .
he &apos;s not doing anything specifically with madison , with a little bit of a game .
so he would work exactly as well -- in a power station or in a plastic plant .
it &apos;s a lot of time .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the predator -- you don &apos;t have to put the credit tag on a stick stick , like we saw it at cloning .
you could also use ordinary health technology to spread .
you have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you eventually get a nuclear weapon of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not the middle east of these attacks .
they &apos;re in the united states , europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the main environments .
we need to make the consequences and we start to prepare ourselves .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was reported very much that people think that the most popular thing is the most popular thing .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
i think the most important thing is , the most appropriate force is , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the most important superpower .
there &apos;s only one and that &apos;s the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for having a neutron of a tomato school . thank you ralph .
i spent the last few years where i was in situations that are usually very difficult and somehow dangerous .
i went to jail -- difficult .
i worked in a computer factory -- dangerous .
i filmed in a shot -- hard and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days doing nothing as this -- they &apos;re getting more fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
i actually have been exposed to the greatest part of my career , and i think that &apos;s a terrible way to study social situations , and that &apos;s all for trying to study social objects , and hopefully , and hopefully a kind of understanding , what they make for the audience successful and accessible .
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world in a tedtalk , and to look at the world , i knew i would do something a little bit different .
some of you may have heard that i took a display a couple of weeks ago , a display .
i sent a few of these , some of the most powerful , and i gave people the opportunity to get the most expensive to the ted of my tedtalk 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , and they got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never allow that to be again -- the most important thing to do , which was actually a lot of content and not many evidence of what the subject was to be a lot of content and not many evidence of what the subject was to be a whole title .
so what you got was this : you &apos;re presented to this name : my tedtalk , from which you don &apos;t know what the subject will be , and the one that will be the content , and the point of content , in fact , could fly around the ears , especially when i hold your company for your involvement .
but it &apos;s a very good media opportunity , but it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a whole lot .
that &apos;s just the most popular thing .
so despite this warning , i knew that anybody would buy the most poor .
now , if you asked me this year , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that to make sure that it was a conscious thing .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
i &apos;ve been going to see myself over the years , i &apos;ve been in some pretty terrible situations , but nothing could be ready to get me out of something so hard , on something so hard , and so dangerous with these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a movie .
what i want to do is a film about the design of the design , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by the design of the film , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; ice system . &quot;
so what happens in the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; of the &quot; the most important , &quot; is that everything from top to the bottom , from the beginning to the end , is completely related to brands -- from the most violent , which is the brand you &apos;re going to see .
now this brand , the polar stadium , the main stadium ...
these people are connected to the film in eternity forever .
and so the film is going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a person &apos;s person .
that was more to the point .
it was &quot; in eternity forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x as a police , but we &apos;ll make sure we &apos;re going to sell any possible category in the movie .
so we might sell a shoe and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever carried ...
the greatest car you ever have , from &quot; the most cosmopolitan , &quot; the greatest drink , the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , a attention of the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; of the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; of the &quot; the &quot; bottom of the &quot;
so the idea is to show that brands are part of the life , actually , to bring them to the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of all the film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of the billboards .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to the end .
and i would enjoy if it was going to help you to do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i first heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how to be a lot of the way people will be .
have you got a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because that has a negative color -- but you know how that will be ?
how much money will it require to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth it to be a few really familiar brands .
and who knows if the movie comes out , we may see how a commodity is coming out of it .
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer is probably not being &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing for the movie or a difficult thing for me ?
jk : both .
so , don &apos;t mean so optimistic .
so , my lord , you can help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands .
yes .
if you look at people you have to do ...
there are some places that we can turn to .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera &quot; would mean that we wanted to lead a nuclear field .
it turns out it meant that it was actually , &quot; we want to do nothing with your film . &quot;
and just that they disappeared all these companies , one after the other .
no one wanted to have something to do with the film .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , your product as many people as possible to present your product as many people as possible .
especially in the world today , on this interface of new and old media and the fragmented media media -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting , exciting , the mass of this message is going to cause it .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a mistake , and that was the following .
actually , no , that was not the mistake at all .
that would have been no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is is , is a problem .
see , if you &apos;re looking at transparency at the most important time , this is one of the first images that appears .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and to detect , and to get separated , immediately , and then , to understand , artificially , artificially , and encouraged to information , especially what &apos;s the biggest line .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a whole lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says , even our ceos are saying it .
but when it comes to that , it &apos;s supposed to be done , something that &apos;s going to happen .
but why ? well , transparency is a hopeless bear -- like this strange bear , still screaming .
it &apos;s a little bit of a sudden -- like this strange highway .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is that ?
a whole dish cool food .
that &apos;s a very risky thing .
so when i started talking to companies , and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid , and my father was caught up -- and he &apos;s sitting and he &apos;s looking at me -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions , there &apos;s three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
but there &apos;s only one company , an agency willing to help us -- and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve been john bond and richard bond &apos;s been -- i found that i had to do it alone , i had to deal with the middle of the middle and to the companies .
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start talking with these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , the idea of how your brand is understood , a broad problem .
i have friends who make big , gigantic , giant , and i have friends who are doing little bits of wood .
and my friends , the great , giant , giant , big , is that the reason why their movies are so successful , is the most important thing that they have .
and then my friends , the little little bits of wood , are going to say , &quot; well , how should we compete with these big , gigantic modes ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; ice system . &quot;
so how exactly are we going to get into the movie ?
whenever i make myself on the way , and whenever i open the most open , you &apos;ll see the carbon &apos;s circuit .
and every time i get somebody to get somebody else , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
they &apos;re so far ? they &apos;re a little nervous .
i want to help you calm .
so maybe you should be a little bit of the interview a little bit of this . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great feats of water .
either &quot; fusion fusion &quot; or &quot; paradise &quot; , you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re being equipped for men as well as women -- solid , or a stick , whatever .
this is the most popular thing .
now i can answer all of your questions and give you a more of a string of a version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand a brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like others .
so , doing things like this -- you know , people can handle -- that &apos;s kind of , why we &apos;re interested in it .
what words would you put in ?
repair is a lot of water .
this is a great question .
girl &apos;s technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone is doing under the approval .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that these categories really make something positive , in contrast to &quot; fighting odor and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them down to more -- better fresh , more fresh , three .
these things have a more more important effect .
and this is a very crude one .
what about me ? what about the most appropriate ?
i have to talk to the man on the street that are like me , a little bit of a computer .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how did you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like beautiful clothes .
&apos; 80s , in the street , goes to a lot of the way , except at the most competitive .
well , what &apos;s the brand of the brand ?
unique .
i think the most important thing that i think is the style of the way that i have , is &quot; the glamour glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , many of the things , and so a stuff .
but normally i have a more of the way of the way that malé , or a jewelry and so stuff .
if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes .
the brand i &apos;m , i &apos;m going to say , i &apos;ll say , &quot; i &apos;m going to fly . &quot;
and , partly , hippie , part of the part , partially freaked out , part of the , i don &apos;t know .
man three : i &apos;m the most pessimistic .
i sell the whole country in the country , the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was a lot of the time .
man 5 : brand &apos;s brand &apos;s brand .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a more skeptical .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t be all the most sophisticated , but i often see myself in the interface of the quantum glamour and the fly fly .
and what &apos;s happened was i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could go into my head , someone who could really help me understand what you call the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot;
and so i found a company called olson , in a company called olson .
they have companies like the street , and they have helped to find out , to discover these kinds of things .
if you could do it for the , you could also help me .
they brought their pictures , they put them ?
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how that &apos;s connected to your thoughts and feelings of yourself .
these are the people who form my worldview .
tell me about this world .
so , this world ? i think the world is the world , where you live -- how people around you , the friends , the family , the family , the family , the way you live your life , the work and so .
all these things come and start from a place , and i come from the place to start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s next to you to talk about .
next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what is this about the idea and feelings of themselves ?
it &apos;s like i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like strange things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; -- what do you bring us ?
what is the most important thing ? what &apos;s the most important thing ?
why is it important , and what is the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little more about you , that &apos;s not you .
what else do you have through the other ?
-- that doesn &apos;t have to be frightened . what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
get it ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . well . okay .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
there was a lot of crazy things that went out there .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their favorite two separate ones , but they have a little bit of the other side -- the morgan morgan is a brand / a brand .
and they &apos;re very good at adding .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies will just focus on a strength , rather than both .
many companies tend to be -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid things where they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re going to be afraid , they &apos;re going to avoid these elements , and that they &apos;re actually going to move them into something positive , and it &apos;s a very positive move .
what other brands are that ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , target , wii , mini of mini plastic and plastic dioxide .
now , there &apos;s a lot of tags and the tags , and these things that come and go , but a more powerful , a brand , a very strong thing .
a more flexible brand . how is your brand a brand ?
if somebody asked them to describe their favorite , their favorite , their favorite , how would they be ?
you have a more confused one ? are you something that &apos;s going to bring your blood into a car .
or are they more like a more of a plastic game ?
are you something that a little bit quiet , more conservative , conservative ?
the things that are , they &apos;re things that are the playful , they &apos;re fresh like the most playful , and they were flashing , adventurous , adventurous , and peaceful , wiser , pragmatic , pragmatic , pragmatic , magical , magical , magic , magic and magic .
or are they more like a football game ?
are they mindful and more satisfying like the street ?
are you established , traditionally , the more educated , compassionate , compassionate , compassionate ?
are you reliable , stable , safe , safe , safe , safe , sacred , celebrity and a way of the dalai lama or a &quot; horse ? &quot;
in the course of the movie , we had more than 500 companies who were up and the &quot; no &quot; said , &quot; no , &quot; because they wanted to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but , 17 hours of people who were willing to get ready to give them some control that they wanted to do with somebody who was doing so , and they &apos;re going to be able to tell us about stories that are going to be , and they &apos;re not going to support stories that would usually never support the story .
they &apos;re going to tell us the story of the computer history , as we tell the story in this movie that you &apos;re using the story of the brain today to get the most sophisticated of the brain to the brain , both around advertising as well as movies .
we went to sao paulo where he was banned .
in the entire city , for five years , there &apos;s no poster , no poster , no server , no server .
and we went in school school where companies are going to make their way to their way to their own way in america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got of most of the feedback or where i had the biggest success , those are where i relate to things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because she thought the middle of the middle , she was the agencies , and they said that the agencies may not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and something completely different , something that people think of , that our world policy challenges .
and how did that work for you ? what it is ?
well , the movie in the &apos; 80s film festival had been able to look at this .
according to the first time , the first time in january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million of the time that this film was .
that &apos;s actually a period of two weeks of two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no tv .
the film was not going to come .
there &apos;s no even online . no more than a computer .
it &apos;s not coming out in other countries .
well , finally , the film has a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every ad agency , with which we were talking to their clients , have been aware of the fingers of that .
something i believe is that if you make your opportunity , risks make risks , that in these risks , they &apos;re going to be able to put risks .
i think if you prevent people from that , you get them closer to failure .
i think if you &apos;re training your employees , you &apos;re taking risks , you &apos;re willing to get a profit .
i feel that we have to make people make people , to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunity that they might be more likely to do .
finally , in progress , we should be welcome to fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
you welcome the fear . welcome to the risk .
one big taste of it , so we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should be welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , we get a little more confident .
and that , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk &quot; hot &quot; is called &quot; the &quot; hot &quot; that was held to be a good , &quot; i &apos;m a good talk of the good friends of the ebay on ebay . &quot;
big data is going to be transformed for organizations around the world in big opportunities .
the name of the &quot; hot &quot; is &quot; hot &quot; .
thank you .
now morgan , in the name of transparency , what is happening right now with the $ birth of life ?
this is a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , and i put a check on the front of the world &apos;s office , the most cosmopolitan -- a check in the height of dollars to fund my favorite year .
my name is a lot of the time .
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i &apos;m going to do something with museums and art , and my favorite , the other day , i had the green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of the research projects and stories that can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the show .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and your access to the same .
i grew up in india .
i was given a great education -- i didn &apos;t get me -- but i had a lot of museums and this artwork , not access to a lot of the time .
when i went to visit , and to visit these museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried to do this longing -- art accessible to technology , to bring technology together .
we then set a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you &apos;re just going to be too provocative .
you can look around in all these museums here .
there &apos;s the most popular thing that moma , the moma , the most expensive , the van gogh .
i even come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get on two , very simple .
and the main point , and the most important thing is , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you &apos;re going to be around and encourage you .
you want to orient in the museum ?
open the map , and jump on with a click .
they &apos;re in the end of the gangs , they want to end up to the end of the gangs .
just keep on . much fun .
design .
thank you , but the best thing is .
so i &apos;m a little bit of my favorite book , and i &apos;m a sophomore of homer &apos;s ted lab in the met .
i see this audacious .
if the museum gave us the picture , it &apos;s going to click on it .
now this is one of the images .
this is all the nerds .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click away .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve been reading with the so-called so-called the so-called .
this picture for example , about 10 billion of the time , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can easily get very easy in it and get it .
you see a funny thing here .
i love this guy ; his expression is treatable .
but then you really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i found that there &apos;s something going on .
and i thought , &quot; wait , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close to the very close , and i realized slowly that these kids actually beat something .
i was doing a little bit of a little bit of familiar with a met , and i actually found that it &apos;s a game called the &quot; animal game &quot; , which is a duck on the front of a stick .
apparently it was very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really close , you can go to the seams .
just to give you the picture of the picture , i think , so you can see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is , it &apos;s still -- in a second .
let &apos;s jump to moma quickly , again , in new york .
another one of me , i think , is a more different one .
in the previous example , it was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the plastic cursor ?
and what if you want to see like van gogh , this masterpiece , because it &apos;s built ?
you &apos;re going to go inside . you can really go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom into one of my favorite , and i &apos;m actually going to zoom into the rollercoaster .
this is a lot of the time , probably never before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing the time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called the collections .
everybody from them , every -- the same whether they have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go back and build your own museum online -- all of these pictures you can put on your own collection .
just , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of the power -- you can get it to the power of the brain .
this is the most popular , in the world &apos;s office .
you can put everything on your own hand , send your friends , and you start with a conversation about what you &apos;re feeling when you look at these masterpieces .
i think finally , for me , the main thing is that all the wonderful things are not from google .
they &apos;re not even coming from the museums .
i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was a experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to be just going to be with this digital medium of art , and they &apos;re doing it pretty online .
and the biggest question that i &apos;m going to ask is , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a computer of a computer ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can split in two camps .
this is half the left , and then the right half the way is , the intuitive side is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the most sophisticated , every hemisphere , we could be able to measure their brain .
for example , this guy would be that someone who &apos;s completely logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you suppress your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have decided for one of these extremes , but i think that for most people in the audience , their brain looks like this -- with a high , high , the same thing in both hemispheres .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or something like that .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i see myself as one of the people in common with most experimental experimental technologies that need a good amount of logic to put the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good fraction of intuition to do experiments .
how do we develop these intuition ? well , we love playing things with things .
so we go out and play with it and then look like it &apos;s going to be , and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing can be just at a place .
i mean , it can sound strange about thinking that one thing is at the same time at two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed them .
i remember seeing a child at a time of play .
he was a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind and it was not very good at it .
but i bet that it taught the game to the most valuable lesson , which is the big things that you don &apos;t just leave , and that you &apos;re going to stay on a place .
and this is a great model of the world , so long they &apos;re not a professional model .
it would be a terrible model for a computer , because they don &apos;t play with the very little odd particles , but with these little odd particles .
and if you play with your particles , you &apos;re all stuck in the kind of weird things -- like that you &apos;re flying directly through walls , or that you can be at the same time at two different places .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little little particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to be the big living objects around us .
this didn &apos;t like my intuition , and maybe because i don &apos;t have a lot of particles with particles .
well , i &apos;m sometimes playing with you , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical side is not like it .
because if all of these particles are made of particles and all these particles that are going to follow the rules of quantum mechanics , wouldn &apos;t it just follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that should be that way .
so i would better feel that all of the things that we could feel when we could show that everyday objects also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a couple of years ago , just to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see , which was in the most cosmopolitan of the brain .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
so , i &apos;m going to zoom on here . we look at exactly the center here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s like a gamble , and it &apos;s about the edge of it .
so i made this thing on similar ways to make a computer .
i went a clean space with new design technology , and i went to a hundred hours of all the big devices .
and i had to build my own machine for the last little bit -- to make this kind of swimming pool and the thing that &apos;s going on .
this thing has the ability to be in the state of the brain , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things but then other people go up and i hear all these things because i don &apos;t want to bother them , or , frankly , they &apos;re going to be .
so quantum mechanics say that the technology is the same as the same .
the fellow fellow fellow fellow , for example , are not only people , but also the light that seems to you and the wind that goes over to you and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is going to behave , we had to get out of the whole of the brain systems .
and we did that .
we have reached the light , put it in a vacuum and the whole air , and it &apos;s all the air , and it &apos;s almost to be , just by the way , in the elevator , the piece of metal , just as it wanted .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it &apos;s actually moving really strange .
instead of being quiet there &apos;s just being quiet , it &apos;s like the way it was like this -- like this -- like a little bit of a time , and together , and together , the other thing that &apos;s going on , and together , you know , the other .
and in the way we put it on a little push , we could put it into the same time , and not to vibrate -- something that allows only in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what really fantastic .
what does it mean to vibrate for a object at the same time and not melt ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion atoms from the piece of metal is still silent and moving the same atoms at the same time .
just too cool voices , they &apos;re fooled .
the rest of the time are they .
that means that every atom is at the same time at two different places , which is the same piece of metal on two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
this was worth making me in the clean room , because , check it , the most expensive between a single atom and this piece of metal is about just as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if one atom can be at the same time at two different places , this piece of metal can be on two different places , why not then it &apos;s not yet ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine , you &apos;re at the same time at the same time , how would that feel ?
how would you deal with your consciousness that your body is in space ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we were pushing it , the light is going to go and roll the box , and the box is always there in a piece of metal .
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator actually just demonstrated objects that are in a small room together .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics say that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more about it , it &apos;s more deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the deep and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we should be able to think of the way we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families are thinking about where they &apos;re going to live and work , they &apos;ve given the possibility between at least a hand full of different cities that all of the ones are in competition .
now we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries that don &apos;t even have a single city to be welcome to .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more worth building it .
so we could just be very simple at the world , maybe hundreds of new cities , maybe .
now , this may sound absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
but just trade the building of homes , just to go from cities .
imagine half the people who want to live in homes , they did this ; the other half doesn &apos;t yet .
you could try to expand the capacity of existing apartments .
but you know what you would be going to be in these apartments and your environment , and you have to avoid laws of messages to prevent grievances and get out of a mix .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to get all of these fiscal resources .
but you could go to a completely new place , a completely new recording block , so that the laws would be there , and they &apos;re not going to be giving it to respect to it .
so i &apos;ve proposed that governments create new areas , which are enough to provide a city for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
later , i found that , roughly the same time , the same time , the same time , and the challenge of reform in captivity .
they knew that every year about 75,000 miles of their country left their country to be in the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same thing in captivity .
in this place , the computer system has said to the world , &quot; what happens when we &apos;re going to get a more of the land of our country , which is when we just put them a message of the american message , a part of the canadian , and when people want to go to canada , they can work on the surface of the world , and they can do it on the surface of the messages , and they can do it on the surface of the messages .
in the summer of 2009 , loneliness suffered under a severe industrial market .
the next thing , the next election election , won the theremin in a shift , whose program , both innovations , promised them .
he asked a little bit of a job to be on his own , his favorite .
in the meantime , i was prepared to remember a talk .
through improvement , and through the study of consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter city , which is essentially reduced to reducing the elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t really care existing to the existing system .
we pay new technologies , but for the progress , it requires technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that are coming back to us .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent a friend to the tedtalk .
and again , it showed him a little bit .
the two calls me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december of a hotels in december of a hotels .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , to be like much more valuable than they are .
and i &apos;ve used this graph to show how valuable is a place to be in a place like new york . think that a surface of a meter is worth thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , in a place when there was a pause , has said , &quot; paul , we might be able to look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk was in very simple form that a charter city is a place that is a place that is beginning to be a place that is going to be determined by the law , a more powerful , the laws that are going to determine and to decide that they can &apos;t either live under these rules or not .
so i was asked by the president of loneliness , who meant that we need to make this project that it &apos;s important , and that &apos;s the way that it is to bring our country into it .
i was asked to get to the first time , and i was going to give you a talk at the fourth and fifth january .
so i &apos;ve been given a more with facts with facts that have a graph like this , which is trying to figure out that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it must be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city of contaminated , and the sketch is the new airport that was built in the khyber airport .
by itself , the one area has a 100 more area of 100 .
so i tried to convince the most sophisticated of that if you want to build a new city , you have to start with a area of at least 1,000 .
these are more than 250 acres .
polite , all the main things .
the faces of the audience were very serious and notice .
the ladder of congress came to the stage and said , &quot; professor , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe you could see the tedtalk .
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i came to the punch line that a new city is going to change people .
there were the opportunity to live in a city that would be in captivity , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also includes new opportunities for leaders with one .
the leaders of the government in captivity would depend on the help of the aid , they could benefit from their own , which they would make the laws for this charter and in the process that they would support that the charter is really taken .
and the realization of president lobo was that the confidence of the massive people i thought of as a way to get the foreign investors could be able to be able to make this city for all the parties in captivity , and mistrust .
we &apos;re in a field .
this is a picture of this place .
it &apos;s just a thousand square miles .
and shortly after that , at the 19th january , they voted in congress for a change to have a change to have a more mature control that &apos;s going to cause specific amounts of freedom .
in a country that has just a intense crisis behind , in congress , in the prison of this , with a voice of a voice , to a voice .
all parties , all the business of society , supported this .
and to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved by congress .
at the 17th of february , it became approved to be approved to a voice .
immediately after this election , between the 21st and 24 february , a delegation of about 30 , a delegation of about 30 places in the world , were most interested in the business of the world &apos;s business .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large , new urban center that built in south korea , and the south american mayor .
everything you can see on this picture was built within four years after four years , which is the scud emancipation .
the other place that was very interested in tahrir is singapore .
it was built two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re really looking at it , it &apos;s where we &apos;re today .
they already have a more mature , and they already think of this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already working on a legal system that allowed us to be able to be able to participate , and it &apos;s working on an external legal system .
a country has already offered its top court to put the supreme court for the public appeal of the system of the brain .
also , the more important and more interested in the world .
they even bring funding to a profit .
one thing you already know , has been done already , there &apos;s a lot of internet rights .
there are many companies who would like to sit in america , especially in a place with a free communication system , and there are many people who would like to live there .
there are 700 million people around the world who say that they like to live in a different place .
a million people leaving latin america a year , and they go into the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to be forced to get their families to be in their own work , sometimes , they &apos;re single mothers who need to make enough money to eat and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes , sometimes kids who try to find their parents , who they have , they haven &apos;t seen them in some cases .
so what is it for an idea to make this kind of thing in tolstoy , to do a completely new city ?
or do they even get to build these cities , or are hundreds of the world around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to have a choice that every family has a choice between a whole bunch of cities that are in competition for new residents ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends from harlem have asked me to say , thank you ted .
you know how many decisions do you do in a typical day ?
you know how many decisions do you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve done a poll with 2,000 americans recently , and the average number of choices that make the typical american , is 70 to a day .
also , recently a study was done with ceos in which they saw the ceos for a week .
and these scientists just have documented the different themes with those ceo , and how much time they spent decisions that are related to the issues .
and they found that a average ceo is busy struggling with a little bit of a sudden .
each of these subjects were of many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions needed an hour or more of their time .
think of your own decisions .
you know how many decisions do you meet in the nine minutes in the one hour of one hour ?
how good do you think they &apos;re the decisions to cope with ?
today i want to talk about one of the largest most important things of our modern time , the most popular .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise it , because i &apos;m blind , just the hand if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i &apos;m going to ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , so , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear about the subject of the brain ?
thank you .
when i was a college student at stanford university , i was very vividly at that very very , very vividly , at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was called the most popular .
this business , it was almost like a car designer .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and oil and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was a time when we &apos;ve actually been drinking even more .
i loved to go to this business ; i asked myself , well , what &apos;s it going to be like to buy something ?
here &apos;s the olive manuscript .
they had over 75 different kinds of olive oil , including those who were locked in boxes that were coming from thousands of years old .
so i decided to visit the heads of people day , and i asked the head , &quot; does this model work that they really offer the people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up the most popular of tourists that came every day and usually had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose to be a experiment for our experiment .
here &apos;s her favorite gait .
they had different kinds of dna types .
we set up a little bit of a little bit of a business of business .
we put six different tastes there , or 24 different tastes , and we put two different tastes : first , i &apos;d be looking at two things : first , i fall to be more people and try to get more and more and more .
it &apos;s more people standing when it was 24 percent , about 60 percent when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what the people were more likely to buy a glass of glass .
now we saw the opposite effect .
and the people who are standing as they were 24 percent , only three percent actually had a glass of glass .
and the people who are standing as it were six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of them .
now , if you calculate it , people bought six times more a glass , who they had six to the choices when they had 24 to choice .
now , to decide not a glass of glass is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the most important thing is that we also have a very strong decision .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it &apos;s going to be our own best interests .
so , the theme of the day : financial access save .
i &apos;m going to describe a study that i &apos;m going to share with you with a study of the computer , and i &apos;m doing a study of the computer , and i was doing the decisions that we were doing for retirement , to retirement , to take care of almost a million americans in the entire united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of the most important people who were a single one of the people who was a single plan , the absence of whether they &apos;re saving , is saving the amount of money .
and we found that there was a relationship in fact .
so in these plans , we had about a little bit of design plans that people offered something between two to 59 different members .
and what we found was that the more fund were offered that , in fact , the participation was lower .
now , if you look at the extreme , the plans , the two fund , had a more mature in the &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want it .
in the plans that almost 60 employees accepted , the most common one , the most common one is now .
now , turns out that even if you &apos;re going to participate in the way more opportunities to choice , even then it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , more likely to get them , the more possibilities they were available , the more they call it and to choose .
the more opportunities you have available , the more they put their money in pure contact .
none of these extremes , to the decisions that someone would recommend , would be , if you &apos;re critical , in the future of your future financial well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential negative rules that offer that to more and more choices with it .
it &apos;s going to push the decision -- push it on , even if it &apos;s going to be the best interest .
they &apos;re more likely to make decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to decide about things that they &apos;re happy to make themselves happy , even if they make objective better .
the main reason that we may enjoy it is that we may enjoy these huge shelves full of the mustard boxes , mustard and oil , but we can &apos;t actually pick the comparison and then actually choose something from fantastic to the other .
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested on different ways and different kinds of different types of different forms -- that they can just apply in their business .
first , just limited .
they &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true , but it was never true anymore .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; just as easy . &quot;
they always worry that they lose the way they &apos;re losing .
but in fact , we &apos;re always seeing it more and more , that if you &apos;re ready to be willing , and the irrelevant kind of possibility will be going to the rise , you &apos;re going to get the cost of the cost of the cost , and it &apos;s going to bring the cost of the cost of the cost of the creation .
as a symbol of the other head and gamble , the different head of the head and the other of 26 to 15 , they had a rise of sales to 10 percent .
when the golden corporation of the corporation sell their 10 to the worst , they &apos;ve been able to have a profit of the profits that are being used by 1979 , and they have a profit of the rise of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of food and reducing cost .
you know , the average oil community today offers 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart is giving you 100,000 products today .
but the supermarket supermarket , the world &apos;s supermarket , is the world &apos;s supermarket , and they just offer them 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in a dose .
now in the world of the design , i think one of the best examples that recently came to the market , as you best , the choice of the choice , was something that david sent very strong , it &apos;s a program that is offered at harvard .
every harvard harvard staff now takes a little bit of a time of a piece of time .
the ones who really want to make a choice will be offered 20 , not 300 or more .
you know , how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to just do it .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i &apos;m the question is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t be able to do it , it can &apos;t be your clients . &quot;
now before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be ready to offer all people in this audience to give a double stack of the world to the most beautiful road .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read you the way .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read you and then please clap them , if you &apos;re ready to adopt gary &apos;s &apos;s supply .
okay . everybody who &apos;s ready to take gary &apos;s &apos;s offer .
are all of that ?
well , let me show you something more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who is ready for this journey .
i think i may have heard more hands .
good .
in fact , that you &apos;ve seen objective , the first time , when the second time , but i would be able to guess it , you would know it &apos;s the second time you thought it was real time .
because the pictures had made it real sense .
what brings me to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of the problem is the most important thing .
it &apos;s about that people to understand the difference between possibilities , understanding what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that &apos;s the consequences of being cruel and they have to be able to be modest .
why are people spending average 15 to 30 percent more than they use a card card or a card card , when they &apos;re a card card ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel like we &apos;re going to be money .
and it turns out that if you make it , something feels like it &apos;s a very good tool to get people to save more .
so we have a study that i did with a computer company that i did with a computer company , and we &apos;ve made a study with people in the world with people -- employees who have been working on the street -- and these people were all in a gathering they signed their participation for their own participation .
and as this meeting , we have just leave this meeting as you &apos;ve always been , we added a little bit of a little .
the little thing we added was that we asked people to think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they would save money .
in the process that we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation to 20 percent and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or a rise to four percent , which they were willing to pay for the most expensive .
the third technology : the third technology .
we can do better with more categories than with more choices .
so here &apos;s for example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a computer factory .
it turns out that in the world &apos;s water industry , and below the northeast of the northeast , the number between the other species of magazines to the very high of magazines to the very high magazines .
but do you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines , and you put them in 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 magazines , and that in 20 categories , you think i &apos;ve given you more choices and a better one , when i gave you the 400 .
because the categories of mine tell me how i can hold them apart .
here are two different types of water .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; the &quot; jazz &quot; .
if you think that the left display is the left , and the ad on the right is jazz , then you clap into your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
if you think that the left is the left on the left , and the one on the right is , you &apos;re clapping , please clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the left on the left is jazz and the right , but you know what ?
this is a highly crude video of water .
the categories have to say something called the most powerful business , not the choice .
and this problem is often when you look at the long lists of all these reports .
who are you interested in doing that ?
my fourth technology : premise for complexity .
it turns out we can actually handle more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to get the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german palestinian , which gives you the opportunity to get your car completely to the other .
they have to make 62 different decisions completely to design their car .
now , these decisions are different in the number of choices that they give a decision .
and the car , the car , the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , signs -- four possibilities .
what i &apos;m doing now is , i change the order of making the decisions .
half of the customers will be from the many possibilities , 56 miles to the low possibilities , four sets of signs .
the other half of the customers are going to be the small possibilities , four sets of signs , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
how interested they are .
if you use the most expensive thing to do , it &apos;s called it overwhelmed , the most expensive , i &apos;m losing it .
what you find is that people who go from the many to the low fish are always choosing the most small ones .
we lose them .
go from the little choice to the many , then you &apos;ll stay .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i did is to change the order of this information .
if i start with the simple , i learn how to do it .
even though the gears choose to pick me on my own , i don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be a lot of time to choose .
it also puts me into excitement of the big product that i &apos;m going to be interested in , and i &apos;m willing to get interested in interest with interest .
let me summarize .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that the problem of the human value -- just -- will be the surplus alternatives , and -- do you -- do it real ; we can put it in real ways , less opportunities to go to complexity .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m describing today is to help you manage the possibilities -- good for you , you can use it for yourself , good for people who are providing service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re in the selection .
and the more we have the choice of choosing , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin clooney &apos;s , i &apos;m a little bit of youtube , and i look at youtube .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how video will be cut down , and then , again , that &apos;s important .
we all want to be stars -- negotiating singers , singer , comedians -- when i was young , that seemed like so infinitely difficult .
but , in fact , the fact that we have , all of us , is that we can become very famous at all of our creative activities in a part of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet until the next saturday .
but youtube is going to be uploaded more than 48 hours a minute .
and again , only a tiny percentage of it will ever decrease down and see thousands of times and so on .
so how does this work ?
three things : the most unexpected , the unexpected and unexpected .
well , we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
whoa !
get a lot of security .
last year , he sent this video to the house he had filmed his house in the $ high national park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this chart shows how it looked like the video was popular for the first time .
actually , the no viral video was really going to do a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing that , if you &apos;re in a high mountain stream .
he had a lot of wind samples up .
and this video was actually sent in january .
what &apos;s happened here ?
there came jimmy &apos;s .
jimmy ornish sent the tweet that was so popular to the video last .
because the way jimmy ornish asks us to do new and interesting things and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s the friday , friday . get down down on friday , and i &apos;m going to go down to the most uplifting , the most cosmopolitan , and friday , friday , friday . friday , friday . go down to friday , i didn &apos;t think we would have this conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
rebecca pugh : &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was almost 200 million times .
this is the chart .
just like &quot; double &quot; , it seems to be not coming from the ones .
what &apos;s happened on this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also more mature .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , the most important thing to do is to write a lot of blogs about it .
michael j. nelson von the science science theater was a first one that was a joke at twitter .
and it &apos;s important that one individual or a group of a group of people would get a point of view , and then cut the process into it .
then this community was formed of people who shared this big joke , and to be too depressing about it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 water types of &quot; friday &quot; at youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a spoof for every single day .
unlike the most popular conversation of the 20th century , the community is the way we &apos;re going to be part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or make something new .
&quot; the &quot; design team &quot; is animation and music in the street .
that &apos;s it , just simple .
this year , it was nearly 50 million times .
and if you keep that crazy , you would know that there &apos;s a more mature one that was four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats , watching this video .
and the creativity is important , the creativity that has been in the most vulnerable of the world &apos;s water and the geeks .
there were bangs .
somebody did an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole family shot from the ground that made it from a stupid joke to something that we can all participate in .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure to do something , we do .
who could have predicted all that ?
who would have predicted &quot; double tv , &quot; or rebecca , &quot; can &quot; predict &quot; predictions ?
what did you do , in which you can write , in which you can do that ?
in a world where every minute is uploaded two days , only one minute , it can only be , really unique and unexpected , like the videos .
i &apos;m not going to be very interested in it , i was not really interested in this , and i &apos;m going to have to look at this great video , i &apos;m going to have a guy who &apos;s standing in new york against a car ticket .
i got a ticket , because i &apos;m not on the front of the car , but there &apos;s a lot of disabilities that don &apos;t go to the most stable .
and so , there was a very surprising and scary thing that was casey &apos;s fun idea , and his argument five million times .
this approach is true for everything we do creative .
and that &apos;s all leads to the one big question .
what does that mean ?
so , the main test .
what does that mean ?
and the creative design , creative , unexpected , is the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture , which has access to each access and the audience &apos;s most famous .
like , one of the most important stars -- justin bieber -- made his beginning at youtube .
nobody has to give your ideas green .
and today we &apos;re all feeling as owners of our culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media and they &apos;re barely meeting the media of today , but they will be able to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the victim between the people about three generations , and how amazing the strength of this connectedness is in the lives of a four-year-old girl , when they were in front of a little girl , and their mother and grandmother , five days ago , sat in the chinese place , and we have no longer disappeared -- this little girl that &apos;s now going to live in san francisco and never disappeared -- this little girl that &apos;s now going to live in san francisco and never disappeared .
the story is not over yet .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s going to be put together .
i want to tell you about some of the most sophisticated .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man , whose whole life of the simple hope of oneness and freedom of his home was together .
if you think about the most uplifting of the retrofits in the front of the holidays , you know , the people who have to be a single waste of life has been a single waste .
the words , so long his friends , the more important his friends .
he moved back to the silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgot me to be life .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the story was really trying to crush us , but we &apos;re leaving it .
the next puzzle piece shows how a boat in the early winter of the ocean is quiet .
my mother may was 18 when her father died -- already in a nursing marriage , with two little girls .
for you , life had a task : the escape of your family and a new life in australia .
it was completely fatal that it could fail .
after a four four and a half , a boat &apos;s boat is silent on the lake as a forest &apos;s .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear they had was the pirates , rape and death .
as most adults were wearing my mother , my mother was a little bit of a little bit of a sudden .
at a time of a computer , i had my sister and i , then you and my grandmother drink it .
my first memories are from this boat -- the continuous core of the engine , clapping one of every wave on the front of the front , the long and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came many times , but the men who were fooled by the men on our boat , or to the most of the time , they didn &apos;t want to start to be the same , or the most than six hours .
but i remember the lights of the ice coast from the coast of the coast , and at the young man , who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and on the taste of the first , the most poor one that gave me one of the men on the platform .
no apple ever tasted that way again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next thing is about four women in three generations , which are together together to build a new life .
we let ourselves down in the field of the middle hemisphere , one of the middle of the gallup diplomatic catastrophes , whose population is from the street .
unlike the most important , whose existence was completely unknown to me , there was no more complete one in the street .
the smells of the world &apos;s competition came from the rest of the world .
and the most broken broken shark plants were used between people who had one thing in common , they started .
my mother worked on farms , then in a line of a train store , six days , twice , twice .
it somehow had the time to find english and to have a lot of people .
we were poor .
every dollar was adopted , and it was put in another education for english and mathematics , whatever we had to get to do . most of the things that came out of the second , they were always the new things that came out of the second hand .
two of the objections for school , every one to cover the holes in the other .
a more of the time to the most expensive , because they had to lose six years .
and there were rare times painful from &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; asian and there , &quot; &quot; asian , goes home . &quot;
after home ?
something more profound in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered on the boat from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until her mexican came , so i could put her back .
she opened a computer , and she opened a business , and she opened a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t change change , angry and angry , and they were born , and they were born , and they caught children , in two worlds .
loans and sponsors were looked very .
centers were built .
i lived in a village in college .
in one , i was the classic asian student , the most prolific demands of himself .
in the other hand , i was involved in insecure life that was tied to the tragic scars of violence , the most sacred and the dispersants .
but so many of them got the help .
and because of that help , i became a young year of the last year of the year of the year , as a young boy .
and i was going to crush by a computer party to the next , and the edges don &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous , anonymous , of the street , was now tan le , refugee and social activist who was invited to talk to places that they never heard , and in habitats whose existence could never have imagined .
i was not familiar with the dragline dragline .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the most playful .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the comfort of life &apos;s life -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who had so poor as a young one of her days , and we were telling each other about the same time , and we &apos;re still in the same bed .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old , as we were on the boat , when we were making the boat .
no one was never a way .
&quot; do it just &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not .
so i talked about the design of the world , and i &apos;m training , and the worship of the most uplifting and the most satisfying .
and the more i talked about , the more i should tell .
i met people in all the way , so many of them did what they loved , lived in the limits of the possible .
and even though i graduated , i realized i couldn &apos;t get to a career in law .
there was another way to give it another more different way .
and i realized that the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , a very thoughtful , new one , new , but not just okay , but something you need to be grateful , maybe a gift of the design .
because the very easily , as easy to collapse , can lead to collapse , so easily , you can get the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve gone to my head of mine to know enough that , yes , the world is going to be more like , but not as you do it .
opportunities that would have been allowed to be explicitly encouraging .
there was a energy , a credible optimism , a strange optimism , and the patent system .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i collected a little team of people to do that , for the pacific , &quot; a challenge , &quot; which was not a challenge .
a year we didn &apos;t have a cent .
at the end of each card , i cook a huge farm soup that we shared .
we worked late to night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant , and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull in the u.s.
after just one journey there .
my gut again .
three months later , i moved and the adventure went on .
before i leave the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up to a time in the most powerful , the social norm and the local person , the most important person .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother moved her .
with 17 , she was the second woman of a nine-year-old who she proposed her .
without support of your husband , she was worried for a significant , by brought it to court and was a lot of a greater deal than she won .
&quot; don &apos;t &quot; prove as a messenger . &quot;
i just had a shower in a hotel hotel in sydney , when she died . 1000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the most amazing and watched her standing on the other side .
i knew she was coming to go to him .
my mother called me a few minutes after this .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in a buddhist temple and sat around their rake .
we told her stories and assured her , that we were still at her .
and to midnight midnight , the monk and he said he had to close the thylacine .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand warm and the rest of your hand is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she &apos;s been holding her for today , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t put them on . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s going to be through the women .
you see who we were and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men that might have come in our lives , we would have come to the agreement .
that &apos;s just the defeat .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i think that &apos;s the boat .
who would ever be a wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid before , before the expense of the body , before the front of the street .
can i give you a bug in your life , the brave person , the wave of the wave , the most powerful , the engine , the long horizon , which doesn &apos;t guarantee anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and you might be safe , i would do it .
and also , the mother &apos;s mother is here in the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it all photography ?
because that &apos;s a picture that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
but i started interested in photography when i got my first digital digital , in age 15 years .
i put it in my former predilection for drawing , but it was a little different , because the camera was actually in planning .
and if you put a picture with a camera , the process ends , if you press on the trigger .
so for me , it seemed like photography was more about being in the right place to be right at the right time .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that begins when the trigger is going to return .
photos like this : a site along a much more sophisticated road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and yet , a realistic plane .
or photographs like this -- dark and more , but all of the common goal , to keep a realistic plane .
if i say reality , i &apos;m going to be a little bit of a computer .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but i want to look like it always , as if you could have that , on a photograph .
photographs where you have to think a short moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about capture an idea , as a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what does the illusion of ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but then , then , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we &apos;re doing is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see you as a puzzle of reality , where you can take different pieces and put a different reality together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect version of physical objects that we can all identify in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , combined , you can create something that looks like three-dimensional , as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so we &apos;re proposing our brains , because our brain is just not really , really simply that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combine of photographs .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a realistic picture , i think , is the things we don &apos;t think about , the things that we &apos;re not thinking about around us in our lives .
but if we combine photographs , it really matters to think about it because otherwise you just look at it .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a nuclear outcome .
as you can see , it &apos;s not three special images .
but you can combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined workers should have the same perspective .
second , in change , photos should have the same amount of equipment .
and these two images are going to meet these two demands -- from the same altitude , and the same kind of thing .
third is about making it impossible to distinguish where the individual images begin and ends by connecting them into a mixed loop .
it doesn &apos;t make it possible to say how the photo was actually put together .
so by looking at color , contrast and contrast to the edges , the individual images , together , put together , how do you , and you can put out the limits between the different images and disorders , and we can see the boundaries of the different images , even though a picture is basically hundreds of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that &apos;s just a landscape , and the bottom part was manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely composed in the process of different places .
i personally think that it &apos;s easier to create a place , because you don &apos;t have to make a compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew i needed several months to plan to plan the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on a giant bed .
the bank is from another place .
the most important thing is from a quarry .
and yes , i even got the house up on the island red to let it look at the swedish .
so to get a realistic outcome , it &apos;s going to be a function of me .
i always start with an act of an act .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s a lot of a lot of time .
and if you make good shots , the result is pretty beautiful , and also realistic .
so , there are all tools , and the only thing that we &apos;re limited to is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic deals with it .
and i think the most important thing is that we stopped talking with our patients .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve introduced on the most violent was to make a difference .
it &apos;s not particularly scientific , and it &apos;s a cup of coffee , or tea , and ask the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how ? &quot;
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want this to be one of the main problems that everybody -- perhaps most of the electronic value effects : because we stopped listening .
this is my favorite thing . a very simple thing .
she has a button , she &apos;s from .
and every morning i get on this .
and yes , i have a job , as you might recognize .
i have my job in 95 lbs .
it &apos;s just a simple thing : every time i get on the scale , you send my data to google health .
and there &apos;s also a little bit of my favorite topography , and so he can see where my favorite , and that &apos;s not just the moment i &apos;m going to support , and it &apos;s also in the past , but also with a glimpse of the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with this , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 wooden twitter on twitter .
so every morning i get on my favorite and the people talking to me before i sit in the car , &quot; lunch , &quot; just a little lettuce today , a little bit of a bird . &quot;
but this is the most important thing that can happen because this is the printing pressure , push , to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could smoke patients .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and to bring them to some kind of game , to control their health .
next week , this is coming up on the market .
there &apos;s going to be this little little bit of this little bit that you &apos;re going to put on a iphone or something like that .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure , to send it to their doctor , to send them to their doctor , for example , to share with another more than 100 dollars .
in this point , the patients come to play . they can &apos;t only be the control of the captain , captain on their own ship , but also helping us help the challenges of health care , and the health care system , and so on .
make ways that are easy to use and start to hug patients in the team .
and you can do that through these kinds of ways , but by capturing .
and one of the things that we did , i want to share with you a quick video .
we all have the whole of our cars in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all the rings around the world are around .
we know one more where all the stations are .
and clear , we can find out the brain .
but where would the next thing that the next day is to help this patient ?
we have a lot of time , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the next bone marrow was going to be able to find out the next little wine .
so , what did we do ? we &apos;ve done in the netherlands .
we built a website and asked a crowd , &quot; if you see a car , please share with us where he &apos;s , when he &apos;s , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , of course , &quot; because it &apos;s closed while it &apos;s closed .
and over 10,000 , they were reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find apps for this .
and we have designed a design system .
we &apos;ve developed an app for the design system , extended reality , to find these kinds of things .
and if you &apos;re in a city like a city of a city , and somebody can drive you to use your iphone , and the next weeks , your favorite , you can get the next one to be able to save life .
and now we don &apos;t want to just be a standard of the way the product calls itself , but also to bring it as a computer company .
and we want to get this on a global level .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , about helping us help us behave like the way they &apos;re acting in the world to overcome these kinds of things .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and someone &apos;s going to be a little bit , it &apos;s their own muscle or somebody else , you can find a more of the time .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies are all helping us in the world that we have in the approval of this kind of state .
and these could be a team of people , or technicians to , for example , just to make sure that the most important thing is to be still on its place .
please help us and try and try and improve health &apos;s health , but to take the hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the world &apos;s office .
and my little favorite thing is that we &apos;re going to force us to do that .
... it gives attention to that .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
oh . a moment .
it might take it to be five .
now -- we can just skip this -- i &apos;m going to skip the video instead .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
the news is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design , to take a year and work in a environment that is so pretty everything you hate , we &apos;ve actually got them working in government .
the program is called &quot; code for america &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the main system for welfare planners .
we choose some fellows every year and we &apos;re working with a little bit of the work .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them into a little bit of the world .
and they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what you really do is to show what &apos;s possible today with technology .
so they meet al .
al is a computer designer in boston .
here it looks like he looks for a date , but what he really looks like is somebody who &apos;s a little bit of the time he &apos;s got a lot of time when he &apos;s a little bit of a fish , because he knows it &apos;s not very good in the national war when he &apos;s a meter of snow .
how did he come to search in this particular way for help ?
we had a team last year of fellows in boston , which is the code for america .
they were in february , and it &apos;s got a lot of the last february .
and they realized that the city never had these fire fires .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik mandelbrot noticed something else , and that was that the residents were free to get the sidewalks straight into these parts .
so he did what everybody would do , he wrote a app .
it &apos;s a nice little app , where you can adopt a fire fire .
you &apos;re going to get to him , you get to the sun &apos;s ass , if it &apos;s the same .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game game .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of 21 apps that have written the fellows last year .
but it does something that doesn &apos;t do any other research .
it &apos;s rapidly spreading .
there &apos;s this guy in the middle of the city , which has seen that he could use this app , not the snow , but , so the citizens are adopting the citizens .
it &apos;s very important that these are working , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use seattle to use the deployment to clean the citizens to clean the necks .
and chicago has just introduced them to make the people who are the most cosmopolitan , if it &apos;s the same .
we now know nine cities , which are planning to use this app .
and it &apos;s spread , organic , organic , of course .
if you know something about the design of the knowledge , you know that it &apos;s not going to work .
and the software takes a few years to take a few years .
we had a team that worked last year at a project in boston for three people , for three months .
it was about a method that parents can find out , which are the right public schools for their children .
we &apos;ve been told later that when it was going to go over the normal channels , it took over two years and had taken over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not even anything .
there &apos;s a project at the moment in california &apos;s heart , which is the taxpayer for two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then spread from the street , is a kind of shot on the front of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- not more like a private company , like many people think that she should .
and not even like a computer designer , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access to that , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , this app is that you represents a new generation that the problem of the government is to avert -- not as the problem of a quantum institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at the collective technology with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people making the tools that we need to take things effectively together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america &quot; , there are hundreds of people all over the country who are up and writing , every day in their own communities .
they don &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re terribly frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all get your feelings about politics and the snake and all the other things that we really upset about is government , in the core , in the words of tim o o , &quot; what we &apos;re doing in common , &quot; we can &apos;t do that alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people have given up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , please , i &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re going to be thinking about it , because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government is ultimately giving up their strength -- they &apos;re going to be -- &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and as many people , i thought it &apos;s mainly about choosing people in office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s all in the community , it &apos;s a lot of time .
this is the call for service and information .
you &apos;re usually coming out when you &apos;re imprisoned in your city .
if you ever have to work in your life call in your life call , like our fellow scott , as part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re doing that all -- you &apos;re going to see that people who call government because of many different problems , including , is a computer change in your house .
so scott gets this kind of crazy thing .
he &apos;s typing &quot; the &quot; killer &quot; in the official database .
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the baby &apos;s test .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock is going to be ? &quot;
and that worked . round for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the most complete .
not only has a call .
it has an app , a computer engineer and a computer company , called &quot; the &quot; name of &quot; the name of the car .
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work very smart people in the office of the new urban community in boston .
one day -- this is a true report -- came in , &quot; the &quot; north field in my field . can &apos;t say if you &apos;re dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; the &quot; killer &quot; is something different .
scott complained to man .
but &quot; the &quot; test of &quot; is all public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next point we got , we got , &quot; i went over there , found the flow of the house behind the house .
do you get it ? yes . alive ?
turned the switch on the side . went home .
good night , sweet . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . this is the digital thing that &apos;s the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is to criticize .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
they were doing these two people .
and you could have to connect them with government services if these were needed , but a neighbor is a very much better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if a neighbor helps the other to help us , we will strengthen our communities .
let &apos;s call it the most expensive , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about that , that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is choosing .
how often have we chosen a political leader -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we &apos;re going to be going back and we expect the government to reflect our values and then not change a lot of time ?
this is because the government is like a further ocean and politics is the top of the top .
and what &apos;s below is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we have that this thing we have , and we pay for the one that makes us work , something else , and then we &apos;re going to be ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real estate is happening .
we need to go to the machinery of the government .
so the most important thing is done .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group more concerned about the citizens who wrote a very detailed report that &apos;s written in a very detailed account of the world &apos;s rights to the world &apos;s rights .
this is not political active , that &apos;s active .
now for those of us who have given up the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we need to reach what we need to do without improving the institution that &apos;s in the name of all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology is able to make it fundamentally vital , the function of government in a way that can actually achieve something that can actually achieve society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the internet , and the white internet knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to do it just right .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up to see their voice as granted .
they don &apos;t fight this fight that we all fight , that who can talk to you , they all can talk .
you can do your opinion , to every channel , every time , and you do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , don &apos;t worry so much about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that are improving the work of government .
and that apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be a fire fire , and deng to kill a trash with a broken force .
and sure , we would have this fire structure all the time , and many people do this .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government that pay taxes and they &apos;re paying for performance .
we &apos;re more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all got for you here : if it &apos;s about the big , important things we need to do together , we will just be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually my role is to explain the people how wonderful the new technologies , which are the emergence of the rise , and i thought , &quot; i &apos;m here under friends , i would tell you what i really think . and i &apos;m going to try and understand what &apos;s really going on , and really try to understand what &apos;s going on , and really try to get back to the same thing .
i &apos;m going to start to show you a single , boring slide .
... you could please show the slide .
this is a slide i &apos;ve chosen to be chosen from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather , it &apos;s about the universal form .
this slide shows data of a analysis of the performance of the power of processors with the performance of a quantum area of networks .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , as many other people we often find in our field , is a kind of a very , kind of a test curve .
with other words , every step here is a power in the ocean industry .
and that &apos;s a novelty that we need to use this guy on the ground on the planet of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the light back again .
something more clean , because i &apos;m going to draw something like this on paper here .
now , why do we draw graphs in technology on the planet .
the reason is , if i draw it on a normal curve , where , say , this is the years that the years of a kind of , so the timeline of a kind of , and this is a certain amount of technology that i want to talk about with a graph , then the graph becomes silly .
and then you see that .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , let &apos;s say a little bit of a more hopeful , and then it would be very irrational , in the form of a flat line .
but if something like this happens , then this changes the world &apos;s most important circumstances .
so if the most fast way to get the most fast progression , we could get the way to get the food services into a taxi and then we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not the same thing .
there was never before in history of the history of the world &apos;s history , which is the kind of kind of a , which is exponentially increases for every few years .
the question i want to ask you now is if you look at this exponential curves , you &apos;re not going to go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything for always and forever evolved as fast as it is .
there are two ways .
either it &apos;s going to be a classic , like , like here , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
this is about it .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think this is going to happen in the way that you happen here .
it &apos;s really , then , we &apos;re in the middle of a transition right now .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition of the world , in a new way of the world .
so the question i want to ask , and i often think of myself , is like this new world , is it going to be like this new world ?
what &apos;s this new state that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing to be in the middle of the room .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
and we don &apos;t go on as we go .
so in other words , the future has declined every year for me to be on this world .
i think the reason is that we realize that there &apos;s anything else .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we know that right now , there &apos;s no sense of trying to look at 30 or 50 years in the future because everything is going to be so different that a simple misunderstanding of what we &apos;re doing now doesn &apos;t make sense .
now i want to talk about what that might be , this transition in which we are currently .
to make this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things , which really nothing with technology or computers have .
because i think that really , we can really understand a step back , and look at the thing on a longer divergence .
and i want to look at this on the epoxy of life on earth .
i think the big picture makes sense when you split it into some of the things .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s 2.5 billion years . the earth was a big , more intimidating , more stable , and a lot of it , on top of the chemicals .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , we have a pretty good picture about how they do the most important thing .
i think there are theories that start understanding how everything has started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of a little bit of a little of the oil that &apos;s related to the chemicals that contain these kinds of chemicals .
some of these oil spills contain a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and grow .
all the way they were , they started rolling down .
these little oil oil were the most primitive things in the world .
but these oil spills weren &apos;t about alive in the world , because every single one of them was just a small , entertaining recipe of chemicals .
and every time it shared , the chemicals are going to be more disparate in the more unequal amounts .
so every droplet was a little different .
in fact , the droplet grew , which had been a growth of growth , faster than other , and integrated more chemicals from outside and shared more chemicals from outside and divided faster .
so these cases of getting longer to survive and they planted themselves in a sense of space .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting it will be when this droplet learned a trick about abstraction .
in any way that we don &apos;t understand quite fully , this droplet is the ability to do information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and in a certain chemical form , which we call dna .
in other words , they have found a way of being found , evolutionary art , which allowed them to , which they were , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is about the time of 2.5 billion years where they were born , right .
in fact , the recipe for us is our genes , which is exactly the same code and the same notation .
and that &apos;s every living thing that &apos;s used exactly the same letter and the same code .
we &apos;re so far , just to be able to write , and write about the same thing .
and i have 100 of the data of a white white house that i &apos;m trying to keep in airports from the back of the day .
in this case , what i &apos;ve done is i took this code -- the code is made of normal letters , which we use to talk about -- and i wrote my business card on a piece of dna and i wrote it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if someone wants a hundred million copies of my business card , i have enough for everyone in this room and even for everyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
i would have been in reality , and then i would have written them on a virus , and in the room , i was born in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna of dna was an interesting step .
and the most important thing that these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened , very interesting step , where things were completely different , which is , these cells started communicating and exchange information , so that communities of cells came out .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
this is why the reason to grow the contagion is growing .
some bacteria have found out how to stay from penicillin and have this information together with other bacteria in the dna and now we have lots of bacteria , which are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria are communicating with each other .
now , these communication allowed the reasons of communities that were in a very literal boat , and they were more mature .
so they either survived , or they were going to be under , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were more likely to repeat and otherwise disagree with evolution .
now the most important thing is where these communities are so close to the fact that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community in a more responsible way .
and the next interesting phase took about one billion years .
at that point we have centralized communities , communities of many of the most highly beneficial , which are represented as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a sort of an extension community .
we have a lot of cells who are not used to themselves .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities began to evolve , so the level , which is what evolution was doing , not longer the individual cell , but the whole of the world &apos;s brain , which we call organism .
the next step was now happening within these communities .
the most important thing began to abstract information .
and they developed special structures which do nothing else than process information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the most prolific , which is built these online sites .
they started to train in specialists in the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and the information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point , a person -- learning happened in the time of the lifespan of a single organism , instead of this evolutionary period of time .
so a organism could learn to be a certain bit of fruit , not to eat , because it liked bad and made it sick , the last time he ate it .
now this could be happening within the lifespan of a single organism , whereas before hundreds of thousands of years of years , it had to be identified by the people who have been trained by the individuals who have died because of these fruit .
so the nervous system has the most profound thing that the evolution has been able to do in a single place in the individual .
she could be in a time of time .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
once for example , the most important version of this computer system is the human language .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , very depressing idea , and i was amazed in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and i &apos;m basically giving up the sound of the sound of me , hoping to create a similar bit of a similar idea in your head that has a certain resemblance with my original idea .
so we take a very complicated , kind of , turning it into notes , a sequence of sound , and it &apos;s producing something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we did is we , we , the humanity , is we have begun to abstract .
we &apos;re going to go through the same stages which have gone through the world -- the abstraction of our methods , how we capture data , we process .
for example , the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
and the computer , computers , the , the hypertext , wyoming and so on are all our subtle mechanisms that we built in our community to get this information .
and it &apos;s connecting us all together to something that &apos;s much bigger , and also capable of getting faster , and it &apos;s more quickly than we were .
so today , evolution can happen in time of microseconds .
you &apos;ve also seen a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a baby &apos;s little bit of evolution where it has shown a little bit of evolution in the &quot; the program &quot; in the program .
so we have the most important time of the world .
the first steps of history , which i told you , took a billion years a piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , took some hundred million years .
then the way the language steps and so on , adopted less than a million years .
and the next steps , like electronics , seem to take a few decades .
the process feeds itself from itself and becomes , i think , the word for it -- if something is worth its energy supply .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explosion of explosion .
we see the process of being feeding from itself .
i live in a lifetime of building computers and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism that i use to build computers , not using the past , without the recently progress in computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design this in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is doing in the world &apos;s office .
it has billions of those .
what i do instead is , and what the designers of thinking is , we think about a certain kind of carbon , and we &apos;re thinking about this machine , and the machine makes it something that &apos;s going to be far beyond our capabilities , better and faster than we could ever do .
and it makes it part of the way that we don &apos;t even understand the way that we &apos;re right now .
one way that &apos;s particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been using recently is the evolution itself .
we install a laser in the machine , which is what &apos;s going on in the field of the brain .
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program which is developed from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , please , please pull a hundred million , randomly controlled sequences of instructions .
now , all of this happens to be chosen to have chosen instructions , and then all of the programs come out , and finally , the ones who are the next ones i have in the next . &quot;
so in other words , i &apos;ll first define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want numbers , which would be a simple example , which i &apos;ve been using for this .
so , find programs , which can be most sensitive to the most likely numbers .
of course , the chance of accident is very small instructions that they &apos;re just looking at numbers of numbers , so they &apos;re not going to actually do the instructions .
but one of those things that may be very fortunate about the right order in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences , which i have the next decade of the window .
store these , the rest of them .
now all of the plastic cycles that have the numbers on best is sent to the numbers .
and that &apos;s a way of the design of the world , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their own , and the kids of the support of the world &apos;s people , the two programs of the group of programs .
so i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that have come closer to the benefits than others .
say , &quot; let &apos;s take this process . &quot;
slash them again .
maybe some mutations are going to be .
and try this whole thing with another generation .
all these generations need a few milliseconds .
and so i can go through a lot of years in the computer , and in more complex cases , some hours , or some of the hours , some hours .
and finally , i get programs that can be numbers perfectly narrow .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i &apos;ve ever been writing from hand .
if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s obscure and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure that she &apos;s doing the job , because she comes from a series of a series of programs that did the job .
because your life was on the top of whether you did the job right .
i sat in a 747 with marvin minsky , and he &apos;s a card called a map of a card , and says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
there &apos;s this airplane from the street , which is the work of the way they &apos;re working in order to make their flight safer . &apos; &quot; don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
we know that a computer problem is not optimal when it becomes too complicated .
so we start to leave on computers , for a process that &apos;s very different from the classical engineering engineering .
it allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than the normal methods that would allow the normal methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of this .
so , we &apos;re going to be in the world .
we use these programs now to make the computer much faster , so that we can do that , and that &apos;s how we can do that process even faster .
so it &apos;s going to create a water map .
it &apos;s going to be faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies of today are feeding itself .
we &apos;re going to pull up .
we &apos;re at a point that is analog to the time , as a result of being developed , as a result of being developed .
so we &apos;re the most important and we can &apos;t really make the difference , which is actually what we &apos;re doing at the end of the hell .
we &apos;re in the middle of this kind of state .
but i really think that after us , it &apos;s coming .
i think it &apos;s very much more powerful from us to say that we are the most late thing of evolution .
and i think we &apos;re all here , and i think , you know , the creation of the creation of what is coming next .
well , lunch is before and i &apos;m going to hear this , now before i &apos;m going to get a little more old .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert with a computer of the airport with a wooden elephant .
we talked about it , not changed since the era of ancient indian airport the mahabharata .
when we wanted to travel at the time , we started to go into a car and we went to the sky .
now we &apos;re doing that with airplanes .
and then when the great indian computer company had thirst , he took a bow , stepped into the floor and water came out .
now we &apos;re doing this with the data and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that really made me sad .
i was afraid of technology .
it was scared that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset , enjoying sunset without a camera and without tweet .
i found that technology should make magic , and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver piano .
this piece of 50 years old was the most popular thing for me .
it became a more mature access to a world full of pirates and the images in my imagination .
i came up with this as what we thought of when our three clocks and cameras were dreaming of it .
they were inspired by this .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it to enable magic instead of killing .
and with 16 , i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling , which can connect readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s bringing pictures and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
the storytelling is always needed more and more .
but what do we do with that ?
i just go to the first time , a interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s &quot; take your finger on any light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to be a character in the book .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad knows through gps where i live -- that &apos;s really true to me .
the child in me is really excited about these possibilities .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean a magician , and the dragons , but the magic of childhood , those ideas we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i found always very exciting .
so you have to turn the ipad up here and the fireflies drop down .
and the light is the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that was fascinated with me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single set of a window .
and so here &apos;s what every book and every world is going to do , and every world i &apos;m going to get to the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
and the main cards had always had maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows and lights and lights in the rest of the book .
it also shows itself in other places .
i &apos;m going to go in here .
and it &apos;s important for me to make something that is important , but also very much , very much .
this is the most popular .
we &apos;ve heard all of the main and the most powerful people , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the most powerful ?
the poor was caught thousands of years in southern leone , in a old book book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary history for children .
a story that has been concerned with new issues , like the most important thing .
the theme of the last 10 years is that the last 10 years of the last 10 years is that children are sitting in their rooms , without shooting .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you have to go out and collect the mermaid of the ipads of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of the art of rock stones , rocks , and currents .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
this is going to get returned . you have to get out of a photo of a flower , and tag a photo of a flower .
in another chapter , you have to have a piece of light and mark .
so , you can actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can put online .
a child in london shows the image of a computer , and says , &quot; oh , i saw a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities that are going to connect the world and technology and technology .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning a interaction that you use the video of the ipads and actually see a animation of the kind of kind of animation that looks at a plant from the house .
and in a place , the screen is going to match the leaves .
you have to make the sound of the brain &apos;s sound , it &apos;s holding it and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the natural forces of technology come closer and in the magic and technology can come to the same .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and closer to the natural world , and the magic , and the magic , and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really a very compelling honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in a prison class , prisons or a prison .
i spend most of my time with the social weakest in the world &apos;s most important and in places where there are a lot of despair .
here at ted to see , and to hear how automated this is , i &apos;ve given a lot of strength .
in the short time , i &apos;m sure that ted has a identity .
you can tell things about the world , the impact .
and sometimes , if something comes from ted , it gets a meaning and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we saw some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that words of a teacher have meaning , but the words of a dedicated teacher is particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional household household , who was dominated by a matriarch , and that saddle-shaped was my grandmother .
she was a very strong , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every single single time .
she was also the starting point of view of the whole world .
she was the daughter of a baby &apos;s daughter .
their parents were born in the srebrenica 40s as slaves .
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery was very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also gay .
when i met them as a young boy , she came to me and return me .
they kept me so strongly , i couldn &apos;t breathe . then they went to me .
one or two hours later , when i came to her , she came to me and said , &quot; do you feel like i &apos;m still holding my hug ? &quot;
and if i said no , &quot; i &apos;m going to give you back . if i said , &quot; yes , she said to me .
and she was something that was made that you wanted to be in your close .
the only problem was that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get her attention .
my cousins went around everywhere .
i remember , i have to be eight or nine , that i woke up in the morning and went to the living room , all my cousins around .
my grandmother was at the end of the room , and i was staring at me .
first i thought that this was a game .
i saw her and i was smiling , but she looked very serious .
that was the way that we went to 15 minutes , and then she stood up and came to me . she took me on the hand and said , &quot; come on , &quot; you and i , we have to talk . &quot;
i remember that it was yesterday .
i never forget it .
she took me out with me , and she said , &quot; i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t have to be a little bit of it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
she said , &quot; you have to promise me only three things , &quot; i &apos;ve got to promise . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i &apos;m going to love you to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; mom is my baby , and you have to have a promise that you &apos;re always going to take care of you . &quot;
i &apos;m celebrating my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and she said , &quot; next , i &apos;m going to do that you &apos;re going to do the right thing . &quot; &quot; well , if it &apos;s hard to do that , the right thing to do . &quot;
i thought , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise me is &quot; that you never will be drinking alcohol . &quot;
now , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south and i have a brother who &apos;s older , and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , my brother came home and brought this kind of beer , and i got my sister and i went to the forest .
we just put it around as well as otherwise .
then he took a drink of beer and offered my sister &apos;s , and she took me , and then she offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . all right . all right . just do . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , now we &apos;re doing this , you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re also doing anything that we do .
i had what , your sister had what , and you know , a beer .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . just do it . just do it . &quot;
my brother fell to me .
he said , &quot; well , what &apos;s going on with you ? well , what &apos;s going on . &quot;
and then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t always do you crazy because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells everybody that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated on the ground .
i &apos;m going to say something .
i should not do that .
this is maybe going to transmit public growth .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m going to have a drop of alcohol , i &apos;ve never been drinking alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s a lot of time . i say it &apos;s because identity is power .
if we create the right way of doing the right way , we can tell people about things that they don &apos;t believe in first .
we can get them to do things that they thought they could not .
of course , my grandmother would tell all of her grandchildren , they &apos;re special .
my grandfather was during the prison prison in prison .
my uncle died at the expense of the disease .
and she believed that this is the themes we would have to care about .
i tried to say something about our centers .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in &apos; 60s , 300,000 people were in prison , and in prison .
today , 2.3 million .
the united states has today the highest revenue of the world .
seven million people are on the ground , or with spontaneous drugs .
i think , in my opinion , the world is fundamentally changing .
in social , and black parts of the population , despair and hopelessness are killing despair , because of these changes .
one of three male black black black people between 18 and 30 is in prison , on the prison , on the ground , or with spontaneous design .
in urban communities throughout the country -- los angeles across philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of the black young men either in prison , in prison , and with spontaneous design , on the prison , on the outskirts of tinkering .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have been made with the data of the world , it &apos;s being bathed by poverty .
we have a non-profit in this country that you &apos;re treated much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
wealth , not budgets , affected the outcome .
but we seem to be very happy with it .
and a policy of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we lost touch .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s some of the things that are going on .
my home home is bound to keep them permanently , if they &apos;re convicted of stolen .
here and in alabama today , 34 percent of the male black population is permanently lost their right .
we predict that in 10 years the percentage of the economic economy is going to be so high as the u.s. capital of the world &apos;s oil system .
silence is a silent silence .
i represent kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , the most poor kids in the prison .
in this country , there &apos;s a cost of children &apos;s lives in the world &apos;s lives without any value of information .
we &apos;ve got a lot of work .
the only country of the world .
i represent people in the street .
the death penalty is an interesting question .
we think because you &apos;ve taught us that the real question is : does a human mind do , is to die for one of him , to die of crime ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other view is not : does anybody make a crime for death , but do we deserve to kill ?
i find that fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
in nine people we &apos;ve been executed , one that we &apos;ve been executed for innocent collective , which was occupied and out of death row .
an amazing , amazing one . one of nine innocent .
i find that fascinating .
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane if for nine planes , who will pick up , a crash crash .
but somehow we do it , we &apos;re going to be able to do this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking about this questions .
i talk about race and the question , whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m an undergraduate story of my students , i talk about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , the time against the end of the reconstruction , until the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
but for the men in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to fear the brain .
or before bombs .
it was the fear of terror , which shaped your life .
these older people are now coming to me and say , &quot; mr , kentucky , you &apos;re talking about the talks , you say people should stop saying that we should stop saying that we should have to stop it for the first time in our nation &apos;s history .
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with this . &quot;
and after the terrorism , of course , the extracellular and decades of the most motivated motivated bribe and apartheid .
and yet , there &apos;s a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what the meaning of our actions have in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly breaking together .
we always create new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to be able to get the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the extracellular people are not to overcome the willingness to be the willingness to be the willingness to be .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was the willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve been holding some talks in germany about death penalty .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists stood after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply troubling , you &apos;re talking about listening to it . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course it can never give you more . &quot;
it was a silence . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we &apos;ve ever been told for the systematic killing of people .
it would be a lot of time , and we &apos;re aware of people , and they &apos;re going to wrap up . &quot;
i thought about it .
as it was feeling , in a world , to live in the german state people , in the german state , people would be especially , especially when they were a lot of jews .
it would be sidewalks .
it would be a lot of time .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old , we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be in the same -- here &apos;s the risk of death , 11 times higher when the victim is white , 11 times higher when the victim is white , and the victim knows the body , which is the body , and the victim knows the body .
and yet there &apos;s this mental disconnection .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with that , with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities will be driven by suffering , abuse , nato , fairness .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we &apos;re talking about that , we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment , to be able to pass in a complex world .
for me , the time is to produce , thinking , to talk about the poor , the disadvantaged , the most likely to be the ones that will never be at ted .
but think about a way of being embedded in our own lives .
we all need to believe the last things we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re so rational , so we value intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this kind of carbon that i believe is not just being open to us , not just being open to all the light and the things that are the dark and the dark and the dark .
ugh : the great majority of politicians , the great majority of people .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe , we were going to do everything , but what we needed most was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be the willingness , the willingness to be , sometimes in a convincing place , and being witness . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe is also the most important thing to do .
there are no distinction to make technology and design that allows us to be human and even human as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and the injustice of poverty .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity challenges much more from us than if we didn &apos;t take it .
she &apos;s going to touch her deeply .
as a young lawyer , i &apos;m going to meet the great privilege , pink parks .
and he was always coming back to the street , and he came back to the next two of her oldest friends , and he had these older women , the old women , who had the most amazing women , and virginia , who had a white , whose husband , a husband , who &apos;s a husband , who &apos;s dr. king .
so these women met and they were just coming up .
and then , in the city , he went to a woman , and then he said , &quot; oh , woman , woman coming into the city . we want to talk to them .
want to start in the position and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , very like . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i was just hearing .
it was always so inspiring , so it was so inspiring .
one day i sat there and i heard these women , and after a few hours , woman was going to tell me , &quot; well , now , you know , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; well , you know , what &apos;s the same thing to be doing . &quot;
what do you try to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to put on injustice .
so , people want to help people who were innocent .
we want bias and discrimination in the corporate system .
we want to eliminate the power of the body force without any of the children .
we want to do something about death penalty .
we want to reduce the number of death rates .
we want to eradicate the street . &quot;
i thought my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; aw . &quot; -- and , i think .
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
and then he wore himself to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore , you have to be very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very careful .
and so i think the ted community should be the ted community .
we need to make ways of putting up the challenges : these problems , this suffering .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a few very simple things .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
if someone lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t hear him , it &apos;s not just a dodecahedron .
even who kills someone , not only is a murderer .
and because that &apos;s the way that there is a fundamental human dignity that has to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with safety in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think that in many places the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so stimulating , we &apos;re not going to be measured at the end of our technology , not the things we develop , not the way we develop and understanding our intellect .
and eventually , a society is not measured in how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged and privileged , but how they deal with the poor , the death toll .
because in this context , we start to understand the actual amazing things that make us feel .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story to end .
sometimes i press too much .
i &apos;m tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas are deeply measured in the way that they think about it in a very important way .
i represent these kids who were convicted of very hard to say .
i go to the training and visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and that &apos;s when the adult is supposed to be .
then i wonder , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn someone into something that he doesn &apos;t ?
the judge looked at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed for a long time , and i thought my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he has to have a job .
right , the judge , the judge has a lot of time .
you should also want to do that .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think of it , i was going to work on a bill .
i had a 14 year-old young young boys as clients .
and i started with this privilege . the headline said , &quot; miss , my arms , 14 black clients like an honor , white , white , white , white man . &quot;
i was told that failure is the most important and the police and the police and the police .
there was a crazy line about this that in this country is nothing more restorative , that there &apos;s only error error .
the next morning i woke up and didn &apos;t know if i only dreamed of this crazy honor or actually written .
and i didn &apos;t just write it , but i was sent to the court .
a few months went over and i just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided i was my god , i have to go to the court and i have to talk to this crazy case .
i got to the car , and i was really overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard that it &apos;s so painful .
and then i went out of my car , and i went up to the court .
when i was the staircase , there was a college , black man , the janitors in the dish .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and return me .
then he scans to me .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched something very deeply in me , identity , the ability to contribute to a community , to a community of hope .
well , i went to the front of the boat .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. lessig , did you ask this crazy grail ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started discussing .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
i wrote that crazy stuff .
and they came in and they got a church hall and office workers .
in the middle of the world , the most popular thing was , the most angry people who were angry , that we talked about skin language , about poverty , about inequality .
i saw my favorite janitors , and i went off .
he always saw the window over the window and could hear the whole thing .
he went and down .
finally , this older black man came with a very , very motivated woman in the kitchen community , and sat directly behind me , almost on the top of the street .
ten minutes later , the judge quit a break .
while the break came in , a computer worker was going in , which was that the janitors in the prison was .
this is the same business running over the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the world &apos;s office ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he saw the chief of the day , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say that boy &apos;s going to be the guy . give it a little bit . &quot;
i came to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe far more often , but that the justice of justice .
we &apos;re not fully designed as people , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and health care .
that our survival is all connected to survival every single one .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and design , entertainment and creativity with humanity , pity and justice .
and most of all , i want to tell you that that &apos;s just the same thing , just say , lose the goal , don &apos;t give you the goal . give them not .
they have seen this audience , this community , an obvious wish , and we heard to help them and do something .
what can we do ?
so , the gallup philharmonic : well , there &apos;s opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a computer center in this spring where it &apos;s about to actually do a effort to do something about the national engineering system , which is otherwise in politics of punishment .
here , in california , for example , you &apos;ll be a billion dollars for the death penalty for the death penalty for example .
and yet , 46 percent of all the world &apos;s lives don &apos;t end with a conviction .
56 percent of all the u.s. companies are not going to be in court .
there &apos;s the chance to do something .
this is the one that will suggest that money in more forms and security is going to be .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the most powerful in america is extremely down .
this is a fact that &apos;s going to be used in a context with increased growth .
what would you say somebody who believes that ?
now , in fact , the number of the most important people don &apos;t really change the world .
most of the most powerful in this country didn &apos;t really believe in the class of the world &apos;s office .
it was the killer anniversary of medication .
so the very dramatic numbers come to the prisoners .
we have a little bit of time of the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have &quot; the &quot; world &quot; technology , which is the people who get people to get around bars , for a more mature , rather than that you forces them , which is the sacrifice of the sacrifice .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a computer company , not less .
and i think our current business doesn &apos;t help anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
and they &apos;re actually having a string of the machine , and they &apos;re actually making a string of power .
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
bin laden is taking an increased increase with himself .
paul in somalia . 3 : spray of the police .
and an 4 speaker , an inch of four : a number five : dangerous .
six : the societal status of six : 65 : 65 hundred .
eight : eight : eight : eight : ted speakers .
different speakers . mass weapons . tornado .
recession . a standstill . egypt . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but also the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative themes , because our minds are given attention to this particular thing .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second , our senses are going to start much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first station is the first station for all the information that the amygdala is .
so the amygdala is our early world systems , our main system .
it &apos;s sent up and the whole information on the search of any relationship in the quest of the danger of the danger .
so if we see the news , we prefer to keep looking at negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; if it &apos;s going to be , the demand is very true .
now , with all our digital devices that we &apos;re seven days the week , 24 hours a day , all of these negative messages is not a miracle , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s always bad .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
perhaps the vast progress that we &apos;ve been doing in the last century through a series of forces , so strong that it &apos;s going to be possible to create a world of abundance .
well , i don &apos;t say we don &apos;t have a big problem -- climate crisis , water , water , water and energy systems -- we &apos;ve already got .
and as people are , we &apos;re much better at doing problems on very long , but they eventually get to overcome .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , which has tripled in inflation , the population of the world &apos;s population .
child mortality has reduced a tenth .
and that &apos;s where the most important thing that the most important , the food community and communication system has reduced a pair of seconds .
steve pinker showed us that we &apos;re currently living in a very peaceful time of the world &apos;s life .
and according to charles ritz , the most recent in the past 130 years is 30 percent of 25 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we &apos;re increasing our expectations all the time .
in fact , we have poverty .
remember that a big fraction of americans who live under poverty , access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , tv , air phones , air , air buildings and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the most important of the earth , would never have these kinds of luxury .
the basis for a lot of it is to form technologies , and these are growing up .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that &apos;s going to be about information technology is going to make great jumps on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the most prolific , and the most 12 to 24 months .
so , this is what the mobile phone costs to be a million times less and less than a supercomputer , and it &apos;s a supercomputer that &apos;s a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how smooth you &apos;re in -- in good ways in bad times , war or peace , recession , depression and food .
this is the result of faster computers that build faster computers .
they slow down for none of our big problems .
and also , despite your logarithmic net on the left , you &apos;re going to go up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to all of us .
&quot; the &quot; test &quot; , something that my friends call autodesk , &quot; sensors and networks , &quot; robots , 3d printers that allow us to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , fuel , and artificial intelligence , sustainability , and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm supercomputer at &quot; risk &quot; watson ?
that was great .
i &apos;ve been looking at the newspapers and looked at the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson &apos;s human enemies . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence is available to each owner of a child &apos;s own .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i started to have a new university that says &quot; singularity university &quot; .
we bring our students all these technologies , and we &apos;re going to focus on how these are used to be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students , companies , products and services to create the lives within a decade of billions of people .
think about that a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this was ridiculous .
today we can refer to dozens of companies that have exactly this .
if i think that abundance of abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for any of the parts of this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibilities .
it &apos;s about to create a mile from a mile .
the scarcity is , and technology is a more profitable force , and technology is a liberating force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of ecosia &apos;s history in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of the dinner to dinner .
the soldiers got a lot of time , and the other , distinguished year-old , distinguished nations .
the king of the king of the day was got a lot of time .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and balinese .
this is why the dome of the body dome was made from aluminum .
although aluminum encounters of the average increase , it doesn &apos;t come as a pure metal .
it &apos;s connected to oxygen and the oxygen .
but then the technology of the world &apos;s technology was developed and made aluminum production so cheap that we use it with our own business .
and then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we think about it today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet of the more energy than we use a year .
16 of the energy energy energy all the arable minutes on earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not scarcity , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve been able to reduce the cost of solar growth in india to 50 percent of the average of the world &apos;s population -- the indian indian in comparison .
the cost for solar energy was over 50 percent of the year .
last month , this has been published with a study that shows that until the end of the decade in the antarctic areas of the united states solar energy is worth solar .
and if we have an excess crisis , we &apos;ll also have water in the abundance .
let &apos;s talk about the design of the world .
do you remember that when carl sagan was the most famous one , when it was saturn , when it was saturn &apos;s , you turned back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did he ?
&quot; a &quot; a blue blue settlement . &quot;
because we live on a giant life .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered to 70 percent water .
yes , it &apos;s a lot of salt , two percent of the water , and we &apos;re fighting by 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new media technology on the way , the way it &apos;s .
and from a conversation today with dean haring , one of the innovators of doing it , i want to share something with you -- he gave me permission -- his permission , the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; of a car in the world . &quot;
it can produce a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day -- whether seawater , the latrine , the latrine -- and all that for less than two cents per gallon .
the director of coca-cola just has a big , big deal with a hundred units in developing countries .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola will apply this technology to global countries in the entire planet .
this is a very important innovation that &apos;s now available today .
and we &apos;ve also seen this with mobile phones .
you know , my goodness , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent of mobile phones from mobile phones to the end of tunisia .
just think that a cell phone with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better amount of energy than president reagan in front of 25 years ago .
and if you look at your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowing and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the abundance of how nobody ever had predictions .
and it &apos;s better , the things that you have spent and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , and the photograph , libraries and music , libraries of books and music , technology to medical diagnostic -- are literally going to be a little bit more complicated and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best thing is , perhaps what &apos;s expected to be health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure of the most powerful , which is called &quot; $ 10 million , &quot; &quot; announce &quot; 10 million prescriptions .
we &apos;re asking the team to put all these technologies together in a cell phone that you can talk to in a cell phone that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equipped with ai , you can test it or your body pressure .
and to win , the device has to make a better diagnosis than a team of a team .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the population of health and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
if this device was sequenced a more powerful or a car company that &apos;s not known , it &apos;s called the world &apos;s center and prevents a pandemic before their outbreak .
but now the biggest force that leads us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the most sophisticated .
and just by the way , the biggest health population against a population explosion is a better education and nutrition throughout the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people online .
by 2020 , we go on the door of two billion internet users .
three billion new minds we &apos;ve never heard before , will be the global communication review .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what will you want ?
and instead of looking at ecological gridlock , i see one of the largest economic institutions of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that are flowing in global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be used by using the money of the plastic , and they &apos;re trained to be trained by the most expensive , and that they have the opportunity to use 3d printers and , as much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the u.s.
as it was with a set of new , never before the voices of new voices .
how about that , the oppressed , where you &apos;re , is to give a voice to make attention to yourself and create change for the first time ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
how about the design of the world that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned through the x prize is that small teams , which motivated by passion and focus , can create extraordinary things , things that could be able to create large companies and governments in the past .
i want to close with a story that really has me excited .
there &apos;s a program that some might already know .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
it was developed in washington from washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will evolve .
and after all the behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the world &apos;s office .
so this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university professors and so forth .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it turns out that today the human pattern pattern is better than the proteins , as the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked , who &apos;s the best of the world , this is not a fair , no , no , no , it was a parent , the manchester , a woman who worked in a day of the day , and the best most famous one in the world was the best most of the time .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous trust in our future , is that we have more power than individuals , to make us better than individuals to ask us to make the great challenges .
we have access to tools with an exponential technology .
we have the passion of a computer system .
we have the capital of the health &apos;s capital .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work online to solve the new challenges , and to do what is necessary .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to have something to do with a piece of medical culture company .
and i think it starts with a medical medical and i &apos;m .
and maybe i &apos;m a long enough time in business when i can give it to me a piece of my own wrong , to enable this .
but before i talk to the actual topic of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re the middle of the world &apos;s office , and we &apos;re moving to the world &apos;s world .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; the &quot; name &quot; seems soon and rotate about statistics and to use this great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to get to a statistic that i hope most of you have heard about .
it &apos;s the most popular of the internet .
we &apos;re talking about 300 , if a bat hits 300 .
that means that the player is probably three of 10 beats .
that &apos;s called the ball to the dance , he &apos;s going to be stuck , he &apos;s not going to be caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball to the first base , it didn &apos;t happen in time and the track of the table was in safety .
three of 10 .
do you know how to call a nuclear geographic league of baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a computer designer .
you know how to call a car change ?
this is a guy in the rest of the line , and that &apos;s a little bit of 10 .
and the final -- like ted williams , the last ted league of baseball players who met during a regular season of 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world in medicine , which i feel about a lot of feeling or maybe a little less likely to be , and i &apos;ve talked about it .
imagine if you have a more responsible and you &apos;re going to publish a computer designer , whose baby &apos;s 400 thousand in terms of the ground is on the ground .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine , in a certain remote area , and they have a beloved person with 4,500 , and they have a beloved , and they &apos;re a little bit of a sudden , whose health &apos;s team of time , whose computer &apos;s computer is at 200 .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better . it &apos;s on the schedule .
and she &apos;s going to blow a laser .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the most important thing for a computer or a nurse or a nurse or a nurse should be a more , a computer card ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody in the whole medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor should be .
but what we do is we &apos;re all in one of them , including them , in the world , to be perfect .
never make a mistake , no one does it , but it &apos;s going to be a sense of how this should be done .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was a legendary scholar student .
in high school , a celebration told a report that brian would learn for a blood test .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little little wine in the sisters in the toronto , in general , in general , in the toronto , of this .
i learned everything .
i learned the origins and the tail every single unit of each nerve , every branch of each closed artery , which is the aorta of the aorta , obscure and ordinary .
i even knew the most popular to classify the computer &apos;s office of the computer .
and the time i had collected more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i was walking down with a little bit of a computer .
and i left medical school with the impression that i knew everything and knew everything , or at least much as possible , or at least as much as possible , that i &apos;m going to be immune to making a commitment to the mistakes .
and it worked for a time for a time until i met a woman printer .
i was going to put a day of a day in toronto here in toronto as a woman in the hospital &apos;s hospital .
i was in the same time that i was covering the most popular layer of service .
and it was my mission when the most popular advice of the advice was looking at the most popular thing .
and there &apos;s feedback to my favorite feedback .
i studied a printer , and she was in a wooden fashion .
and when i read her , she made sound sound .
and when i was with her chest , i could hear a sound of sound on two sides , which said that she was suffering under a heart failure .
this is a state that fails to fall the heart , instead of breaking the entire blood on the floor , and it &apos;s a part of the red in the lung , and they &apos;re going to get this , so the most important one .
and that was not a hard diagnosis to the training .
i hired them and made me care .
i gave her an unthinkable . i gave her a drug to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call water pills , and the water that they call the liquid .
and over a period of a year , a half to two hours , she started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
i actually did two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my favorite book .
i didn &apos;t take that to you and i did what i should have , what would have been a call at my favorite , so that he had a chance to make a picture .
and he knew it was able to be able to get more information to her .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the doctor &apos;s doctor .
maybe i wanted to succeed and be able to take responsibility , that i was so able to make it , and i would be able to make my patients contact without it .
my second mistake was worse .
so that &apos;s what i sent to you after i sent a little voice , i &apos;m a quiet voice in me trying to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , i was very excited that i asked the nurse , which was the nurse who was doing it , and he was fine , if you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and he said , &quot; yeah , i think it will go well . &quot;
i remember it yesterday .
so i raised the most popular and an ambulance and an ambulance and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this nagging feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working on it .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , down the hospital and went to a parking lot to drive home with the car , when i did something else that i didn &apos;t do .
i went home to my way home .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen after ms. printer , but another three words , and fear the most of the most powerful people that i know .
other medical doctors fear that , but the civic care is particularly , because we just see the patients that kind of annoying .
the three words are : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient you thought home ? &quot;
asked the nurse tzu .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular kind of area .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
about an hour after that they had gone home after sent them home , they collapsed and the family called , and the family would bring them back to the top of 50 , which is a dangerous test of light .
they barely breathe and was blue .
the most sophisticated thing was taken .
they gave her their favorite .
they were playing them on the top of the street .
i was shocked and to the inner movement .
and i &apos;m running these rollercoaster because they went to the intensive care system , and i hoped they would recover .
and after two , three days , they realized they never had to decipher .
she didn &apos;t have a verifiable job of smallpox .
their family gathered together .
and the next eight or nine days , they led the most expensive .
on the top day , she &apos;s going to go -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say you never forget the names of the people who are never forgotten .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
the next weeks i made answers and i learned the first time myself , the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isolated , not the way of healthy shame you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about the colleagues about it .
you know all the healthy shame if you give a secret of the best friend , even though this one on the street is a little bit of the time , and then you get the best friend to participate and then get the best friend to join and get a terrible discussion , if you &apos;re going to get a bad thing and you &apos;re going to be exposed to that .
if you do it , you never do the mistakes again .
this is the kind of design of shame .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes a sick one in the heart .
it &apos;s a little one that says that not what you did , but you &apos;re bad at yourself .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t on my own business , he was very happy .
he spoke with the family and i &apos;m sure he was the soviets , and sure that i didn &apos;t get sued .
but i asked myself to ask these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the most popular ? why did i send them home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why went to medicine ?
but slowly , it &apos;s going to be .
i started feeling better .
and then a day of a day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke up and i might be able to feel better again .
and i was with me that if i had my efforts to perfection , and never ever missed a mistake that the voice could be abused .
and she did .
and i was working on it .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the prison hospital in a north hospital north of toronto and i was documenting a 25 year-old man with a little more old man with a little bit of a day .
it was a lot of time and i was in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked at the most painful and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and as he went from the door , he showed up his shoulder .
two days later , i came to my next ted company and my favorite book asked me to talk to her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the patient &apos;s day . &quot;
it turns out he was a more responsible thing .
he had a potentially transmitted disease called the so-called ice system .
you can google the google , but it &apos;s not infection of the bottom , but the top line is the bottom of the water and causes the decline of the bottom .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got a little bit of the time , and he recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same kind of time of shame and self-doubt , and i felt free and went to work , and then again , and again , and again , it happened .
in a corporate community , i have two times a more mature .
there &apos;s a lot of time that you think about it , especially if you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital that had only 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and there was no cure in their treatment .
i thought he had a thought of it .
i &apos;m going to do this x-ray of the kidneys , when it was without a designer &apos;s company , my colleague at the bottom of the patient &apos;s rights , and called the criminal justice system .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i &apos;m going to go to the front of it to the head of the book and asked my colleagues also to be involved .
and he did and he did a little lower sector in the right sector , and he called the surgeons .
in both cases , it was a lot of time and it was good .
both cases of mine , i &apos;m going to go to me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake was only in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues , but it &apos;s a lot of nonsense .
some of my favorite five years later , happened in the last five years .
alone , ashamed and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t finish with my mistakes and talk about them , if i &apos;m silent , what &apos;s really happening to me , what can i possibly find , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they don &apos;t make the same way ?
if i had a room -- like , i &apos;m not a clue what you think about me .
when did you hear the last time about the ted company of the ted company , talking about the ted story of the world ?
oh yes , you go to a cocktail party and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about your own mistakes .
if i had a full , and i would ask you to say , and to tell her immediate support , and to tell you what i just told you , i would not get to the end of the second story before it really would be , and you would change the issue and forget the rest .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues , a little bit of a sudden that a little bit of a sudden that would have been lost in my hospital , then you think i would have trouble looking at it in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who are not doing . those who are sleeping , who are sleeping and the lack of the good results with bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response to the way antibodies attack one person .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we are the ones who are doing mistakes from medicine , that we are going to stay a safe system .
but there are two problems that are there .
in my about 20 years of medical health , and journalism , i have a personal medical study , and the wrong treatments to make a medical medical study , and the wrong treatments i wrote for the first article i wrote for the toronto star star for my show &quot; white sex , black style , &quot; to learn .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely valid .
we &apos;re working in a system in which every day , in which one of 10 is either a false or false , and it &apos;s a false or false , and that &apos;s still going to be more powerful and more of the devastation .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians die in the world .
in the united states , the institute was taken for medicine for 100,000 .
both are strong , because we don &apos;t look at the problem that we should do .
and it &apos;s the most important thing .
in a corporate war , the medical wisdom of the medical knowledge , all two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
sleep is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error , so that we can take a perfect diagnostic system for a patient with pain .
and then i take the same patient with a little bit of the patient , making it a little bit of a little bit of a breath , and i &apos;ll give you a little bit more easily , and i &apos;m going to take a little bit more threatening to take a breath and get it around .
i don &apos;t take the same course .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they &apos;re not telling me their symptoms always in the same way .
all of this is inevitable , all of the mistakes are inevitable .
so if you take the system like me , how i was taught , and all the main parts of the world , then no longer the end of the world is left .
and you know the most important thing about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , white business , black species , i have the habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everyone from the most violent to the design of the computer , &quot; this is my worst mistake , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; i &apos;m going to show you the microphone .
and then their caregiver expand , they &apos;ve come to the head , and they &apos;re going down and they get heavy , and they &apos;re going to start telling their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes that i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what you need is a environment which is able to bring it into the situation .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new part of the physician is a human , knows about his humanity , accepted it , is not to make mistakes , but it &apos;s all about learning about it , but it can be taken out of them .
they share their experiences with other people .
they supported when others are talking about their mistakes .
and it shows other people &apos;s mistakes , not to be about the other , but in a love , supportive way of all of them benefit .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life and when it &apos;s so , then people are doing mistakes of time .
so the system is developing , creating the system that makes it easier to find mistakes that are inevitable , and it allows people to create the spaces that are being observed in health , and actually , in fact , the potential of the people who are being observed , and that &apos;s what the potential of these reward are being rewarded and actually reward for the most important of these reward .
my name is brian goldman goldman .
i &apos;m the most organized doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i &apos;m doing mistakes .
i &apos;ve been documenting , but i &apos;m trying to learn best from it to give you another one .
i don &apos;t know what they think of me , but i can live .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about the design of the computer .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories about it , to use time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was in 1978 .
you might think he killed it , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he collected fish .
he described one of these as a very &quot; common &quot; .
it was a giant one .
until in the &apos; 80s , he was stuck in great style .
now he &apos;s listed on the red list .
this story we &apos;ve heard many times from the galapagos or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we still come on the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the most popular you are still describing as an 11-year-old .
what &apos;s happened here ?
the second story is to make a different concept , the most important thing , the most important thing .
because i studied it when i was in 1971 , in 1971 .
i went there because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad indoor and i was convinced that i really didn &apos;t get out there .
it was my first reconstruction .
as you see , the lagoon was a prisoner &apos;s heel and a few trees .
there were a lot of the diameter of about 20 inches , a subset of the u.s.
the seawater of these twin people were very efficient and fishermen lived well , and they were doing a lot of it in ghana .
when i returned to 27 years later , the fish passed down half of his size .
triple , they are five centimeters .
they were genetically modified .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had the happiness to be there .
so it doesn &apos;t change anything , and yet it &apos;s changed everything .
my third little story is telling my favorite story of the introduction of the research in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- rather at the beginning of the &apos; 60s -- a lot of the university of europe .
and the world &apos;s countries that were already going to have 100,000 fish that had been the industrial fishing ship that was quite ugly in the world .
i went to this , and we went around the southern sea of the south sea , and especially in the southern sea .
we had no words for what we started there .
i know that it was the bottom of the ocean .
90 percent of our dna systems were sponges , other animals , who are connected to the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there on the rubble , the most expensive ones , were the most important ones .
basically , the bottom of the ocean was going down and then got back .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you take an example of a survey and then start with the local fishing fishing .
the reason is that it &apos;s changing -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft coral will be a crap thing .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , you threw them away because they were dead .
once we started a living alive .
she wasn &apos;t drowning yet .
then they wanted to kill them because they could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain is going to crawl around from the rubble every time they drive in areas where they &apos;re never locked down .
it &apos;s not going to be documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we &apos;re looking at our most new level of the new level and calls us not in memory , which was there .
if you &apos;re going to get it , what happens is that .
on the y-axis , a few good things : biodiversity , number of the most violent , the green of your country , the most green .
it &apos;s changing . it changes , because for people , they are all of the actions of course .
every generation looks the images that they &apos;re starting to start to start with their conscious life , as standard and will follow everything .
the difference is that it &apos;s seen as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
there &apos;s a sequence of changes .
and at the end , they just want to get the most popular remains .
now , this is mostly our goal .
we want to get things that are gone , or things that are not so much like it .
you could think that the problem was people who certainly were , as they lived in the world , and they were killing animals , and they were just aware of a few generations , which they had done .
because obviously , a animal that was very often , once there was a lot of times , once it was going to be a lot of time .
so you don &apos;t lose natural animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a big loss .
we &apos;re focusing on the big animals , and the ocean is the big fish .
they &apos;re getting less , because we start them .
and the time is a little bit of fish , and we think that &apos;s the most important thing .
the question is why people accept this .
well , because they don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
they &apos;ll confirm it because the evidence , as they put in a previous form , are not like they would like to be a symbol .
for example , there &apos;s an anecdote that the report of a computer report was looking at in this area , which is a great deal of time , or not being used by the other , or not , because he &apos;s not &quot; scientifically &quot; .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous big role that can play a marine reserve .
because in the marine field , we basically put the past back .
we &apos;re going to ask the past to see people who can &apos;t understand because the most expensive ones have changed and very low .
so , the people who see a marine reserve and they can get the point that allows them to optimize their own their own .
what about the people who don &apos;t do that because they don &apos;t have access to the people -- the people in the middle west for example ?
here , i think , i think , the art and the movie maybe fill the gap , and simulations .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was a lot of time -- 500 years ago .
and the most important thing , you know , remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think of &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were touched from this -- except from the most important , why were they so touched from the most violent ?
because it &apos;s something that has been lost in a way that &apos;s been lost in a way .
so my only one , the only one i &apos;m going to give is to turn to cameron , so he &apos;s &quot; avatar ii &quot; under water .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist , you had to , if you had a typewriter , that in the government , you would be able to chase this in the government .
they also had to erase a sheet of the amazon of this typewriter .
the reason for this is the government could track where a text came from .
they found an article with a video of the art of the thought , they could find the creator of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do something like this , and how much that would be protected .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
but if you &apos;re in 2011 , today , in 2011 , a new consumer company , and print a page , then this side is bright yellow , and it &apos;s on every page of the surface of the surface , in a pattern that makes the site clear and your printer .
that &apos;s what happens today .
and nobody seems to be a little bit of a time .
and that was an example of what our own governments are doing to us , the citizens , to use the citizens , the citizens .
and this is one of the three main points of information today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening on the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three main points .
there are superstar companies .
for example , this is mr. strangelove &apos;s ted &apos;s book of the ukraine in ukraine .
and the motives of the long-term systems are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use a lot of money to make a lot of money , a huge pile of money .
there are several known cases of the world &apos;s time , the most important ones that you have through attacks .
this is a video of the street of the city of estonia in estonia .
this is alfred cousteau &apos;s .
stephen watt .
so , the main test .
these are matthew anderson , and so on and so on and so on .
these people are online to wealth , but they have acquired it by using the horses , to make money from our bank bank , while we &apos;re doing our online online , and we &apos;re doing the data , and we &apos;re running online , using a computer online .
the u.s. intelligence agency is the swiss fund of mr. sam a bunker , and on this account of mine , sudhir &apos;s million dollars , as it was frozen .
mr. farms himself is on free feet , the horror is unknown .
and i &apos;m saying that today &apos;s more likely to be a victim of a nuclear field than a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will be even worse .
in the future , most crimes will play online .
the second largest world we can see today is not driven by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- the protests , or the way they do .
groups like anonymous are moved over the last 12 months , and they have become one of the most popular ones on the field of the field of the world .
so these are the three main points : criminals , who are doing it for money because of the money , and the last group of nations are the ones that are taking resistance , but the last group are nations , governments that lead attacks .
there are cases of the world &apos;s time .
it shows a great thing , which is what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
the netherlands is a very high out of the netherlands -- or it was this .
in the last fall , it had to be blogging , because it was hacked .
somebody was hacked , and it was a lot of revelation .
and last week in a meeting with dutch , i asked one of the senior senior the people who had been able to do it for possible , that because of the most human people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how do people die in a remote remote ?
and the main news is a giant one .
they sell the plastic system .
what do you do with the brain ?
well , a certificate is needed when you have a website with a little bit of a game with a service of the service , for some of the , for some of the guards .
now , we &apos;re using all of us , or many of us , some of the humanities or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly common in the united states like iran , where iran , where they know they can be more trust than the local players , and that they &apos;re not in their conversation , so that local government can &apos;t be in their conversation .
but you can do it in a foreign field .
so , venture imaging , and he &apos;s chasing fake music .
and that &apos;s what happens in the case of the brain .
how about the arab spring and the things that are happening in egypt ?
now , in egypt , the emperor of the indian was the headquarters in april 2011 , and they found a lot of records .
in these records , a folder was called &quot; the &quot; sniff . &quot;
and in this folder , notes were in germany of a living company that sells the egyptian government to have a few programs that they were -- in very big frame -- all of the egyptian citizens could hold .
they had sold this program for sponges , the egyptian government .
the main thing is right here .
so western governments are feeding governments with a government , so that they can do their own citizens .
but western governments are also helping themselves .
for example , in germany , just a few weeks ago , the so-called the name of the book was found , that was a meme that was used by german , to become a citizen &apos;s own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be accused of a car , you &apos;ll be pretty secure with your phone .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
they tap their internet connection .
they use tools like the most cosmopolitan to get their computers to a meme that allows them to monitor their entire communication , their own , their wildest protocells , their wildest play-doh .
so if we &apos;re going to think about these things , the obvious answer is the people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t matter because i &apos;m a good citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i don &apos;t have to hide . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not about debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we today , in 2011 , our governments are trust , is every right that we &apos;re going to be able to get to , for always always .
and we trust , trust us , we trust each future government , a government that we may have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to do the next 50 years .
it seems strange to you , but i &apos;m a big fan of the book of the art system .
the first one was made by the birthplace of the 1930s , and the very basic idea of a simple idea : modules from cement with random dots , which fit .
and the very quickly , very quickly , became the most fast the world &apos;s test system in the world .
they were giving us the ability to build things that were bigger than we , building bridges , a stone after the other .
essentially , the most important thing was the building system of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of this .
it &apos;s called &quot; automatically scientific rock . &quot;
and within a few years , lego was moved in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for all .
lego basically has the most important , the building block of the world , and it took a block of a building for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the same year , the next revolution announced the next revolution , the next building block .
the transistor was a small , small one that was a little bit of static , and it was a world of static , and it was going to be interactive to a world in which it was made .
as the most powerful , the transistor allows us to build a lot more complex , more complex circuits , a stone after another .
but there &apos;s a mass of water : the transistor was only for experts .
i personally accept that , that the building block of our time is for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the audience and designers .
a few years ago , i started to develop a lot of time .
let me show you how they work .
and the media molecules are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re more competent , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best thing about it is they connect together with magnets .
so you can &apos;t put it wrong .
the stones are a lot of the stones .
green is a copy , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is wire .
so everything you need to do is to connect a blue and a green , and you can build a very quickly amount of energy .
they add a blue blue , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between , and you &apos;ve created a little bit of a little bit of a plastic cycle .
take the switch out of a box that &apos;s here , and you &apos;ve made a little bit of a little bit of a plastic system , and you &apos;ve made a little bit of a plastic card .
add this to a little bit of the extra effect , and you &apos;ve made a more powerful thing .
i &apos;ll stop that .
and the simple play is actually quite powerful , and it &apos;s actually quite powerful .
instead of coding , you have to program , or you have to do , or you have to do it , you have to program a simple , intuitive gestures to code .
so to accelerate the flashing , or slow down , they just spin on this button and it makes the momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind the street is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world in a more mature stone .
lights , sound , the engine , motors , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve spread up the children &apos;s children and see them playing with them .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how they start to understand the electronics that are going to be around in the everyday life and they don &apos;t learn to school .
like a computer designer , a computer designer works , or why the doors of the computer &apos;s computer system , or how a ipod responds to touch .
we also brought out the street system .
so , for example , we had a designer with no experience in electronic things that started playing with a material .
here we see , with the software , paper and water bottles , like the street .
a few weeks ago , we brought out hunting makers , and they gave them some designers , who had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; do what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a more flexible tool .
but wait , this is really my favorite story .
it &apos;s a hummer from play-doh , fear in the darkness .
for those of us , the more material , the more material , electronics was just one more material .
and we want to make this material available for all of us .
so , the open open source is the source .
you can go to the website , all the main print , and you can make it yourself .
we want the world of creators , the inventor , the swedish , the swedish , because that world we live in , this interactive world , we heard us .
so , pull out and start to invent them .
thank you .
