you know , one of the great things that travel in the travel and one of the pleasure of the research research is to live with people who can remember the old days , and they still feel the past , and they &apos;re touching the wind , they touch
just the knowledge that the world &apos;s learning is still beyond the milky way , or the importance of the myths of the inuit of the inuit of the inuit of the inuit of the inuit , is the very breath of the the dmca , which is the ultimate
and of course , we all share the same thing .
we &apos;re born all . we get kids to the world .
we go through the street .
we have to be able to do with the limiting separation of death , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dance and art .
but interesting , the unique tone of the computer &apos;s unique tone is the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the most important in the forests of borneo , or the most popular in haiti , or the warrior in the south pacific of the world , or the warrior in the southern seaboard , or a corporate center in the sahara ,
all these people teach us that there are other things that are different , other ways of dealing with the guidance of the earth .
and that &apos;s a notion that if you think about it , you can just fulfill hope .
together , the myriad cultures of the world form a net from a grid of water and cultural life that is the earth , and for the world , the world &apos;s most important is as important as the biological ocean , which you know as biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural media model as a design of a computer , and it can be done as the most cosmopolitan of all thoughts and dreams , myths ideas , inspiration and intuitions that have been formed by the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
the main news is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and what we &apos;re capable of as an amazing species of species .
and as much as the biosphere was getting very shy , this was the way that it was with the most powerful speed .
no biologist would say to say that 50 percent or more of all kinds of time are just about extinction , because it &apos;s simply not true , and yet , this -- the most powerful thing that we &apos;re doing , the most important thing on the area of
and the crucial prediction of this is extinction .
when anyone in this room was born in this room , 6,000 languages were spoken on the earth 6,000 languages .
now , a language is not just the whole of the vocabulary or a series of a series of the user .
a language is expression of human mind .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a particular culture is going to access to the material world .
every language is like a forest of mind , a turning point , a sense , an ecosystem , an electrical ecosystem .
and from those 6,000 languages today , as we sit here in monterey , the half of the kids are not going to be in the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught to be the infants anymore , which means that if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely than being the silence of being a few of the last of your people , to be the last one of your language , no way to have a chance to give the wisdom of the ancestors or the hope of children ?
and yet , in fact , that terrible destiny of actually somebody on earth , about all two weeks , because every two weeks , a elderly dies , and takes the last superpowers to be a grave , a young language of a old language .
and i know some of you say , &quot; it &apos;s not better ? &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not a better place , &quot; the world wouldn &apos;t be a better place when we would all talk to a language ? and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s
let &apos;s be nell . &quot;
and then suddenly you would see how it would be if you could not speak your own language .
so i want to take you in a journey today through the design of the world , a short journey through the surface of the world to try to understand what &apos;s actually lost .
now there are some of us who have been forgotten that i say , &quot; different possibilities of his , &quot; really different possibilities of his own .
for example , take this child in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the amazon , the people of the world &apos;s population , believe that they &apos;re going to be the most threatening from the east of the east of saint snakes .
this is a people who not cognitively the colors between the colors blue and green , because the forest &apos;s forest is dependent on the forest , from the people .
they have a curious language , and a computer system is called the linguistic system , you have to marry somebody who talks to another language .
all of this is the root in the toughness past , and that &apos;s the strange thing that &apos;s in these big houses , where the most obvious , or seven languages are spoken , but they &apos;re talking about the fact that you never hear somebody who learns a
you just hear to speak and start talking .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the most amazing people in the northeast of ecuador , was an amazing people first , the first year in 1958 .
in 1957 , five seminal clicks were trying to capture a little bit of a mistake .
they threw out little little pictures of the air down , which we would consider as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people from the rainforest had never seen anything more like this .
they raised these photographs from the forest floor on , trying to see behind the face or the character , found nothing , and they were doing business business , and they kill the five punchline with the spear .
but the most popular didn &apos;t just get out of the spear .
they &apos;re going to be a lot of the rest .
54 percent of deaths happened by the deaths .
we &apos;ve been looking at the most ancient generations , and we found two cases of a natural death and as we are looking at people with very troubling , they gave them a little bit of the one of the people that he had died because of his age
but at the same time they had a clear insight of forests that was amazing .
their hunters could smell the urine of a animal from 40 steps and determine what species of these people was suffering .
in the early stages of the years , i got a really amazing task when my professor asked me to go to haiti , and to be the secret societies that were the foundation of the strength of the power of the power of the power of the power and
so to give you a sense of a sense of a sense of this , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of the most remarkable , and voodoo is not a cult of the black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex kind of view .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask you , the great world &apos;s great world would say , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , or whatever .
a continent is going to leave down , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious faith of course . of course , there was a very profound thing , and it &apos;s just the main part of the very deep religious thought of the
but what &apos;s interesting about this is that this living relationship is between the living and the dead .
the living supply of the minds .
the spirits can be pulled out of the big water , answers to the rhythm of dance to be able to dominate the soul of living , so that the most thoughtful moment for a brief moment will be the god .
the most powerful people say , &quot; you &apos;re going to go to church , &quot; you &apos;re talking about god .
we dance in the temple and we will be to god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the mind , you &apos;re going to be taken off the mind , how can you be doing damage ?
look at this amazing demonstrations : the red demonstrations in a museum that &apos;s red coal without combustion , an amazing graph of the ability to influence the body that it &apos;s going to be a very extreme case of the extreme arousal .
well , from all people i met , the kogi was from the sierra nevada de everest in santa santa santa santa presidential arts , most extraordinary .
offspring of the old civilization , which is the heart of the middle world of colombia , and in follow the year , that people moved into a super violent fashion , which is a huge amount of time on the caribbean of the caribbean .
in a field of a continent , these people were the only ones that were never approved by the most cosmopolitan .
until today , you &apos;re going to be dominated by a ritual priesthood , but education is a priesthood , but it &apos;s very extraordinary .
the young people are separated in age three and four years of their families , and in a world of darkness , in the early world of the darkness , in the early ocean , the glacier , for 18 years , , they &apos;re taking out the glacier ,
and while this whole time , they will be introduced to the values of their society , values that sustain the claim that their prayers and their prayers , the cosmic , the cosmic -- we could sustain the ecological -- is useful .
at the end of this amazing , this amazing day , you &apos;ll suddenly be out of one day and the first time in your life , you see a sunrise , and in this particular moment of consciousness , you &apos;ll see a 404 , and in this case
it &apos;s so wonderful . you need to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and saying that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now , this level of intuition is going to be very important .
whenever we think about victims and landscape , we either have a very inclusive and the old piece of the fancy wild , which is a very , a very fancy thought , or the other thing that &apos;s going on in his simplicity , and we say , these
so , native people are not savanna , they &apos;re going to be supported by the accountants .
it &apos;s not a lot of space in the world &apos;s wildest wildest or cold winds of tibet , but they still have , through time and ritual , and a mysterious computer sensor , the world &apos;s worth , is not based on the way that the earth can
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child from the andes , which is growing in the belief that the mountain is a plastic , which is a very different , and a different relationship , will be a whole person , and a different relationship to that resource , which is
if he &apos;s a shocker of a mind or a bunch of breaks , it &apos;s irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor , which is defined in the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of british columbia , and i believed that these forests are there to be more , more cosmopolitan .
this made me a different person when my friends under the front of the fish who believe that these forests of the plague of the plague and the curved spirits are the , and the dotcom spirits are living in the world , spirits that are going to be involved
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took last april in the northwest of the amazon amazon .
this is a lot of you who have heard of the most of you , the most powerful thing that &apos;s going on from the repertoire of the hotel of the hotel .
what &apos;s fascinating is not just the potential potential of this kind of carbon system , but it &apos;s actually being made by two different sources . on one side , there &apos;s this wooden surface , which is a series of plastic , which is a series of a
these plant contains some very strong mechanisms that serotonin , and the very common thing that the serotonin is very similar to .
if you &apos;ve seen the most popular , how you &apos;ve found this stuff out , this substance that contains it from different types of species .
and to find this powder , about this , about a half of the brain , is about being shot from a sea of the surface of the liver , and the landing of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to be produced in the reality of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have with my professor richard , richard evan , who pointed the most profound of the magic mushrooms with the discovery of magic mushrooms in mexico , and i said that you can &apos;t put this in the same way to experience a hallucination .
but the thing about the thing is that they can &apos;t be taken out of the way that they can &apos;t be taken by a human gut , of course , by the time , of course , with names of the human gut .
you can only be put in connection with some other chemicals that the mao &apos;s shark &apos;s .
now , the fascinating thing is that the most amazing thing that exists in the world &apos;s office are , you know , the kind of thing that is necessary to be able to get the data to be able to get the control of the world . so ,
how can these people from a cliff of 80,000 species can &apos;t find these two types of plants , who are in the way that they combine , if they combine , a kind of a kind of a narrative version , that the whole one is going to be
we use this great euphemism , trying and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
but you ask the indians , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the most powerful , have 17 varieties of plastic , which you see all of the big distance in the forest , which is for our eyes as a kind of view .
and then you ask them how they call their favorite and they say , &quot; i thought you know something from plants .
i mean , you know nothing ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that every one of the 17 varieties of wood , and they sing to a different kind of energy .
now , that doesn &apos;t bring you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting .
now , the problem of the problem is that even the ones among us who have sympathy for the difficult part of the native americans , as a function of the world , are looking at the past , but they &apos;re just just looking at the past while the
so , in fact , you &apos;re in the 20th century , in 300 years , not for his wars or technical innovation , but rather than a era where we were operating and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth , and the problem is
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new educational systems .
and the problem is not the technology .
the most popular people didn &apos;t hear less on sioux when they bow and arrow , when americans stopped being americans , as they stopped being horse and the new business tasks .
not change and technology , the integrity of the internet &apos;s body , it &apos;s power . that &apos;s ugly face .
and wherever you &apos;re in the world , you will discover that these cultures are not the decline of the decline . these are dynamic living peoples , which is being displaced by brain capacity , and the existence of the world &apos;s brain is being emitted by the same
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m doing a lot of research , you &apos;ll see that ugly face of political domination .
you know , the genocide , the most common , the most pervasive extinction of people is being convicted , but the most powerful , the destruction of the lifestyle of people , will not only be convicted of it , but generally , and more responsible than a part
and you can &apos;t understand the malware of malware if you haven &apos;t experienced it on the ground .
i went to the young colleagues , 6,000 miles from 350,000 miles from 350,000 into the suburbs , and only when i came to pornography , i saw the face behind the statistics of the people who were murdered in the galapagos of the world , 6,000 , and they
the father of this boy was identified as a marker of the chief lama .
that meant that he was immediately killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle was accused of her holiness in the diaspora who brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked up when punishment was for -- to be wealthy for the crime .
he was smuggled in the prison of two years in prison to hide under her own baby , because she couldn &apos;t live him .
the sister who did this brave was made in a field of a computer .
one day , she came out of a railroad , and she had to put it in a heavy camp for seven years , and she had to take it for seven years .
the suffering of malware can be dizzy , but the most powerful spirit of people is a little bit more somber .
and at the end , we really have a choice of choice , and we want to live in a world of the world &apos;s population , or in a world of the diversity of diversity ?
margaret atwood , the great anthropologist before she died that it &apos;s her greatest fear that while we &apos;re in a thread , we would move , not only the range of human imagination , but we would have to be reduced by a dream of the human imagination ,
and it &apos;s a humbling to think that our species have been there for 600,000 years .
the most popular revolution that brought us to agriculture , and we &apos;re at this moment of the cult of the animal &apos;s cult , which is replaced with the word of the priesthood by the priesthood of the priesthood , replaced by the priesthood , and the institutional theory
modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we &apos;re in the next millennia .
if we ask these myriad , the importance of human beings , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to be able to visualize the possibility that we are : people with consciousness , who are aware of the importance that all people and gardens are being thriving , and there &apos;s a great degree of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took on the northern end of the mountain , when i went to the street , and this man , the most wonderful , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather &apos;s .
the canadian government is not always connected to the inuit , and during the course of the world &apos;s population , the most profitable years of our rule , they were forced to pull in settlements .
the grandfather was refused to kiss this old man .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the guns and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit don &apos;t have fear of the cold , they used them to their advantage .
the most recent of their sledge were originally made out of fish , which was locked in the wild of the city .
the man &apos;s grandfather was not afraid of the arctic night or flying storm .
he went out to the outside , and he took his pants down from the street , and he had his hand , and when the feces started to market , he formed it in the form of a very somber .
he &apos;s got the wrist of the pages of the computer , and when it was completely frozen , he was a dog with it .
he &apos;s the dog and a fulbright gave a given loan , took the skeleton of the dog and a tornado jacket , put a different dog on the street , and the baby &apos;s worth with the mit chief with the bus on the house .
you can do nothing like that .
and this is a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all indigenous in the world .
the canadian government had the inuit in april 1999 , the complete control over a field , which is bigger than california and texas combined .
it &apos;s our new country and it &apos;s called the world &apos;s home .
it &apos;s an independent area . they &apos;re all controlling the whole area .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can look for his people and can reach .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are gone to these distant goals of the earth , realizing that they &apos;re not away at all .
they &apos;re the most popular of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination , which go back in times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , are part of the geography of hope .
what we finally try and do in national geographic is that politicians never achieve anything .
we believe that the most powerful -- we believe that the most compelling thing is that we believe that the human being can change the world and we think that storytelling can change the world and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world .
3.6 nations send our energy supply .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we &apos;re a series of trips to the u.s. bank that we take our audience into places of cultural wonder that they looked blind , and hopefully they &apos;re going to take a lot of the other epiphany of anthropology , that the wisdom of all people can contribute
thank you .
what i first do is , as quickly as possible , the basic work is , a new technology that we have as part of a year , we have a bit of a deal of it , and it &apos;s a place where it &apos;s either local or distant
we see many , many books on digital photographs that you &apos;re going to be able to do , and it &apos;s ongoing , floating , floating , to be new .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we &apos;re looking at , how big these collections are , or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of the library of library and it &apos;s in a domain of 300 , 300 meters of food .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that the performance of a system can be like is the number of pixels on your screen in every moment . it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of the world &apos;s worth of design .
this is the house house house from the dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it really is a text and not about a picture , we can do something like this to really show that this one real representation of the design and no image is .
maybe this is a synthetic way to read a more powerful way .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a case of a case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every major picture is the beginning of a section .
and that &apos;s really what you &apos;re doing , and the good experience of a magazine , or reading a real kind of a magazine , or a newspaper , which is a kind of a medium with multiple scales .
we also did something about the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a false ad with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical play-doh .
and this is actually taking these ideas , these limitations for available space on the screen .
we hope that this is not a yahoo and other nonsense , that should not be necessary .
of course , the mapping of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re going to contribute to this area .
but these are all roads in the united states .
the top on the top of the ocean is nasa &apos;s picture .
let &apos;s take a little bit further .
this is actually live in the internet . you can get it out .
this is a project called the name of the name , which is really two different technologies together .
one is a very good research , and the other is a very good research about the surface of the lakota , a university student of washington , under the counseling of steve , at the university of steve .
and rick &apos;s research research was done by microsoft research . a very good collaboration .
so this is live in the internet . it &apos;s driven by the internet .
you can see that if we create these kinds of views , where we can go through images and make these experiences of the remaining resolution .
but the spatial orientation of the images is actually meaning in terms of meaning .
the most popular ones have been put together these images with the real space , where these images that all of the time were made in the canadian ocean , they &apos;re in the canadian ocean , and they &apos;re looking at the elements of the world , and they
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are what is much more competitive .
i would like to show up one of the original data points of noah and that &apos;s from a early prototype of the world we &apos;ve been working on in summer , to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology , which is the main
we had to make ourselves care of the lawyers and so on .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral , and that &apos;s just in the computer with images of flickr , just give you a little sergeant , and you &apos;ll get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the ground , and so , every one of these orange tapes
so this is all the kind of stuff that &apos;s all about , and they all stand in the context of the way that they are in relation to each other .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
you know , i &apos;ve never believed that i could eventually work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
and i guess you can see that this is a lot of different cameras : everything is about the most responsible to professional school , a pretty large number of them , which were all in this environment .
and if you can , i &apos;ll find some of the weird ones .
many of you are covered by faces so that &apos;s why you &apos;re carrying faces .
there &apos;s a series of photographs here . here you are .
this is actually a poster of fide dame , which was actually recorded right .
we can shift from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point is that we can do things with social environments , and it &apos;s going to be collected now by all the collective assets -- from the collective collective storage of how , visual , the earth -- and everything will be connected .
all these photos are connected to each other and it creates something larger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from all the earth .
look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen earth .
and that &apos;s something that is using the complexity that people use , and it &apos;s growing and use for the user with the use of the use .
their own photos are going to be with $ lethal , which has another person &apos;s own .
if someone did the hard thing , and all these sacred did , and i &apos;m telling you who they are , my photo will suddenly be , and i can use the picture of the tornado , and i can use it as a starting way to use the
and of course , oil sources are the tremendous rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that have not been only by using the world or satellite images and so on , but by collective storage .
thank you .
do i understand it right ? your software allows you to get into a certain period of time , all the images that are used by someone in the world in the world , are being connected together ?
yes . you don &apos;t do anything else than you &apos;re discovering .
if you &apos;re building them , they &apos;re going to synchronize between the images .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the amount of the guards , which have many of these images .
as if you do a little bit of a video for pictures , where you go and put the text on the website , a lot of information is about that , which is the picture .
but how if the picture is linked to all your images ?
then the number of the mandatory , and the amount of the data that makes it really , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic , a classic , more fundamental .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , which i hope is in the process of being with other things that you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections if you haven &apos;t noticed that .
i want to start with what i &apos;m referring to , &quot; official &quot; .
the official state of what ?
the official official of all western industrialized societies .
the official state of the state is that if our goal is to maximize the common of our citizens , this is particularly due to the most important of the freedom of freedom .
the reason that freedom is good in itself is valuable , meaning , a sense of a traumatic premise for the human .
if people have freedom , everybody &apos;s in the way to do things that we maximize our collective and no one has to decide .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more good they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply that it would not be going to be going to be a question .
and it &apos;s also deeply rooted in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what we have to make modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say something about the ted system .
there &apos;s five of the main lines in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t get the 10 extra extra extra extra pieces of freedom and 12 people who could buy them to make a large number of their own lettuce in the unlikely case , in which the course
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then you go to the top store , put a stereo -- speaker , a , a plastic , a radio , radio , or , and in this one electronics , there &apos;s so many stereo of the body .
we can put together millions of different stereo of plants from the components that are offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a great choice .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , because you could put everyone on the phone , you wanted to put it in the phone , as long as he came from mommy bell .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
one result was that the phone never broke .
these days are over .
we now have a completely infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- the most popular , and sharon , and sharon , and sharon .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that , you can be sure that you &apos;re going to be able to be it soon .
and what it does is it &apos;s getting people to walk into business and ask this question .
now , you know what the answer is to this question ?
the answer is no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life that are very significant than buying the objects , the same explosion of choice is to be true .
health care -- it &apos;s not the case of the case that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could do a , or we could make b .
a has this benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do they want ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a has this benefits and risks and b , and b has the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift is a burden of responsibility for someone who knows something -- -- the doctor &apos;s doctor -- to someone who knows anything and most likely
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like them and me , and that if they think about it , it &apos;s not a sense of doing anything because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do you advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , you expect to call the doctor &apos;s next morning and ask a change of the prescription .
something that &apos;s so profound as our identity is now a question of choice , how this slide should show .
we don &apos;t preach identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re so much as new as we want to .
that means that every day you wake up at the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where the most common news was that almost everybody had one and that they were getting so fast , and then they got so fast kids like they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , not what they did after that .
all right , it &apos;s all simple .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i did earlier .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i get married or not ? &quot;
should i get married ? should i have kids , or just do career ? &quot;
these are all the questions that are all about .
and they will answer these questions for the best , whether that means to make all the tasks i &apos;m going to give you and not get good grade in my class .
and in fact , they should do this . these are important questions to be asked .
work -- we &apos;re blessed how carl showed us that we can have a little minute to work every minute of every single day of every place in the planet -- to the average hotel hotel .
there &apos;s one corner of the way that i &apos;m not going to tell you about the most important thing that i &apos;m going to do .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice we have to make decisions , again and again , and again , if we should work or not work .
we can play our kids on football play , and we have our mobile phone on one hip , and our blackberry on the other hip , and our blackberry probably on our lap .
and even if you &apos;re all turned off , every minute we &apos;re asking our child to the naked of a football system , we also ask ourselves , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; is it going to be a very different experience of your child &apos;s experience , and it would have been very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and little things , material things and lifestyle , is a question of choice .
and the world we were living in was like this .
so i want to say , there was some choices , but not all was a question of choice .
and the world we &apos;re living in now is this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to get a bad thing about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , a way , is that he &apos;s sorry instead of getting to free .
so with many options you can choose , people will be very hard to decide to even decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this , a study about investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to the white of the video of the giant , giant radio , and about a million employees , and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 year-old worker offered the employer , taking the participation to two percent .
they offer 50 more people -- 10 percent less employees , if they &apos;re only offering five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 more , the ones who are on the choices is so hard to decide that they &apos;re going to throw it on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , and tomorrow .
understand that it &apos;s not just called the people eating food when they go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to build it , it means that they &apos;re missing great amounts of their employers .
they &apos;re not investing in participation until 5,000 dollars a year on the top of the world who would have been happy to reproduce their contributions .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it makes it look like this is the world .
they really want to make the decision right when it &apos;s for all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment of the other investment , or even the wrong thing .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome paralysis and make a decision , we end up having less content with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is , if it &apos;s a good choice , in a different way , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is the most amazing thing , and it &apos;s just that it &apos;s a different choice , and it
the more ways it &apos;s there , the easier it is to regret at all that is a very disappointing thing to make .
second , what economists call the world &apos;s administration .
dan gilbert made a big point today by telling how much the way we evaluate things , depends on what we &apos;re going to compare .
well , if there &apos;s very many alternatives to remember , it &apos;s just attractive properties of alternative , which you &apos;re missing , which makes you less pleased with the alternatives that you &apos;ve chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for you , you know , that &apos;s not new york , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . you have it all for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my inbox is gone .
i could park directly from my house . &quot;
and he &apos;s spending two weeks of thought that he had missed the possibility of having a great day day , a great parking parking program .
the security rate is the happiness that we get through our selection , even if what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more opportunities there are to choice , the more attractive properties of these choices are taken into the most violent .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon makes some explanation .
he makes a statement about living now and maybe do things slowly .
but a more important point he &apos;s doing is always who you choose to decide to do other things , don &apos;t do other things .
and these other things like a lot of attractive qualities , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do less powerful .
third : the expectation of expectations .
this was what struck me when i was offering my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost the whole time .
and there was a time in the it that was just a kind of a type of time , and they bought them , and they have bad , they were incredibly fond , and they were incredibly fond , and they had a lot of time , they started
so , to buy new jeans after many years of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans , here &apos;s my height . &quot;
and the vendor said , &quot; do you want to clean , easy , or a lot ?
do you want the buttons or a thousand ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you &apos;d like to cut down down , you know , blah blah blah , blah , and so on .
my jaw was down and after i recovered , i &apos;d like to have the way that the only way that we had the only way .
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour with all of these damn jeans , and he got the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best appropriate jeans i ever had .
i had better . all these choices allowed me to have better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it to myself .
the reason that i felt worse was that i felt bad with all these possibilities , my expectations for what a good few jeans were going to go up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations than they only had in a way .
when they came in 100 species , damn , one of them should have perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i had to get to what i expected and what i was expecting to be a while in comparison .
and that &apos;s increasing by the opportunities of people &apos;s lives , which are increasing the expectations that people have , like good , that they will be good .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because , if you would , you know , you don &apos;t know what it is .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is , the sooner was better than anything worse than anything was worse , it was for people to make experiences that were a comfortable surprise .
today in the world we live in -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best for that you can ever hope to hope is how to expect them .
they &apos;re never going to make sense of a pleasant word because their expectations , my expectations , are bad .
the secret to the top -- that &apos;s what they &apos;ve all come to -- the secret to the most low are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have better . i didn &apos;t have a lot of time .
but wade is not always a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of a bad sit game , if there &apos;s only one kind of buying a way to buy that if you &apos;re dissatisfied , and you ask why , who is responsible , the answer is , the world is responsible . what would you have
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they &apos;re buying a disappointing , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to be the question : you .
they could have better do it .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the ball , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , if people make decisions , and even when the results of the decisions are good , they feel disappointed about themselves .
clinical depression in the industrial world is expanding in the last generation .
i think a privilege -- not the only , but a privilege of the explosion of the depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced the champagne because they &apos;re so high , and then they have to be able to think of it as their standards
and so the most powerful thing is that it &apos;s all better , and we feel worse , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official state of the day that we all think of right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question , that &apos;s a little bit better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow , but it &apos;s not going to be more choices than something .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we have missed this point long at the time that we have our collective health .
now , as a rule -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a rule of question , which is what &apos;s going on to think about the world &apos;s thinking , which allows all these choices to the industrialized societies , is the material wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of them , not the problem to the big choices .
your problem is that you have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry : steve levitt told you yesterday about how these more expensive and hard car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
they even hurt .
they &apos;re worried about that we &apos;re bad .
if something that makes people make our society make decisions like this , people in the other way would have been moving to the societies in their own choices , wouldn &apos;t just improve the lives of people , but also being improved .
economists call this a more powerful application .
so , the point is that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all these big choices are shrinking .
finally , read this cartoon , and , a advanced person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know nothing in this sort of infrared system . &quot;
juveniles imagination , a computer view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i thought that the fish knows something .
because the truth is , if you break the car &apos;s license , so everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the car &apos;s license , that &apos;s how everything is possible , it &apos;s going to reduce happiness .
they increase the paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a computer system .
this is almost with perfect security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the most important thing is that it &apos;s a metaphor of a metaphor , a recipe for misery , and , i suspect disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects earlier , about the human genome and what that could mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code to a new stage of biology by designing new lives and build it .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve been able to have been able to have nearly 20 years , and when we sequenced the transition of the analog world of biology to digital world of biology .
now , we &apos;re trying to ask ourselves , can we be able to regenerate or can we create new lives , from that digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma , which is the smallest genome of a species , and we &apos;re trying to replicate it in the lab , and we tried to do it with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it to about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that &apos;s here .
but if we look at these metabolic map that is very simple , compared to our own . trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we &apos;re all looking at these genes we can take a living in the other , it would be very unlikely to be
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to go forward , actually , to get this chromosome to the front of the individual , which allows us to confront the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we get a chromosome of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a sudden ?
does it allow the chemistry to make this really big molecule that hasn &apos;t been done before ?
and , if we can , we can start the chromosome ?
one chromosome is just a piece of a piece of light chemical material .
our steps at the nanoscale life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has been very slow , but yet , we have increased and then we have a more exponential curve now .
we started with this 15 years ago .
it actually took a couple of years of a review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out that it turns out that it &apos;s very difficult to do .
there are tens of thousands of machines that can make the little pieces of dna , and 30 to 50 letters , but it &apos;s a very , a process of a process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new method that we put together that little pieces and the mistakes could correct .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x .
it &apos;s a little virus killing bacteria .
we made small pieces , made a chocolate error and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting stage came when we took this piece of carbon chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were broken by the cells , and then they got back and killed e. coli .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said they were able to understand this model .
they laughed more than they do .
so we think that this is a situation in the software that can actually build your hardware hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go far further . we wanted to build a whole set of chromosomes . it has more than more than more than more , more than the more important letters , and we thought we could build it in cassette tapes of the size of the
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information is really accurate .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the most popular base base of a year was a 10,000 base base .
we found the most responsible at the time , when we had used the original sequence , it never has been possible .
part of the design is to create pieces that are 50 letters long and overlap with other people &apos;s work to build smaller amounts of light that fit these together .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built the air lab .
think about it : we have a code code : a , c , g and t.
so , the letter of this letter -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids ; and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we just signed up just signed .
some people were disappointed that it was not a poetry .
we &apos;ve designed the pieces that we could just break them with enzymes . there are enzymes that are repair these and then bring them back .
and we started making pieces of work , starting with the five to the most prolific letters , added these together to make these together , to make these together , until the sun .
in every step we &apos;ve produced these pieces of surplus , so we could sequence them because we tried to create a very robust process of creating what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we tried to get to the point of the oil system .
so , this looks like a giant machine .
if we get to this right big work -- with 100,000 pairs -- then these aren &apos;t just going to grow in e. coli . it &apos;s beyond all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we went to others .
we had been named by a mechanism called the design of the design of the world , which uses biology to repair these kinds of pieces that can pull together these pieces .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s a organism called the iliad of the three million rads of radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , it &apos;s all like that , and it &apos;s been put together .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely dried up , they can even live in the vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life exists in space and can move to the sperm conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a key molecule that we &apos;ve made that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- actually , we used just to use the right design with the right design of the pieces , we have the yeast that we have automatically combined .
this is not a coffee of a regular family .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the most fundamental .
these are footage about a long time of six seconds .
that &apos;s the publication that we &apos;ve just done recently .
these are about the most prolific letters of the code of code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with a structure of the structure that has ever been created by people .
it has a huge one of 300 million .
if we would run it with a more powerful and without distances , it would include the same pages of the city , just to put it in the genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s a very simple thing to do with a virus , and it &apos;s much more complicated to deal with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier to do it in the way we &apos;re in the way that we are : you just take the nucleus out and you have another in , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about the clone .
in the face of the cell , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but only recently we showed you that you can do a full transplant of a chromosome from a cell to another and that activate .
we inspected the chromosome of a laser &apos;s surface , roughly , these two are the same as people and mice . we gave some of the data to break this chromosome , and it was very amazing as we put it into a cell -- and it was very
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that there is the end , but we tried to get a little further to the process .
this is the most powerful of evolution here .
we &apos;re all finding species of species taken up a second chromosome or a third of the world &apos;s worth of a third of the world , every time thousands of characteristics in just one second , to a species .
so people who think of evolution as a gene is changed at a time , a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called the root molecules that actually digest dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no one ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve added .
it was taken in the cell , and it realized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and so we had just a cell on a new chromosome .
it &apos;s the blue of the genes that we put in .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species and transformed completely into a new species based on the new software that we have in the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we have .
it may sound like genomic design , but we can , by moving the world &apos;s rights , things pretty dramatic .
now i argued that this is not the most popular -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i argued that we might be able to create a new form of the cambrian explosion in which there might be massive new organizational explosion based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re in the next 40 billion people in the next 40 years of the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in the year in 1962 .
today , three people on this planet are in 1962 , in the year , and within 40 years , it &apos;s going to be four .
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for 1.5 billion people .
it will offer a challenge for nine .
we need about five billion tons of coal , and we need to have a hundred billion barrels of oil , and that &apos;s a hundred million barrels per day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace that , it will be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s the whole co2 of this material growing in the atmosphere .
we now have , from our discoveries all over the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the most powerful ones of the future .
the most powerful , a dozen components , and see the diversity of that came out .
we &apos;re in the first line of the biological reality , and we &apos;re in the context of the biological reality .
we have technologies today because of these fast fast things to do what we call the genetics genetics .
we now have the opportunity to build a big robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine making these 20 million different genes , or to optimize these processes to make a bow or a drug , or drugs , we can change a little more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just selection selection . we can go through the design of chemicals , production of chemicals or a drug system and so on .
this is a shot of real design that we &apos;re working with , which is actually to sit on , and i &apos;m actually able to design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to look . we know exactly how to look at your genetic code .
we &apos;re now focusing on fuel of the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn ethanol recently , which is a bad experiment .
we have fuel of the world &apos;s population and third generation that will be pretty soon the amount of higher levels of energy , like air , or different kinds of plastic types .
but , as we think , the only way of biology is a big impact without more likely to increase the cost of food or the limitation of their availability , if we see co2 as starting as we see co2 , and so we &apos;re working on cells that
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first generation of the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and that in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 is a way .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different methods .
this is a organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about a month , a mile , in almost a long time .
it &apos;s turning co2 in methane to use hydrogen as a source of hydrogen .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use carbon dioxide , which could just be brought to the ground , and then , in the coal , the co2 could be able to make it happen in fuel to make this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- we have -- we have -- we have -- we have the kind of -- the whole of the gluten industry , right . if you could not do that at ted , where you could do a main amount of energy .
but we &apos;re working on this right now , which is the same thing for the development of vaccines .
you saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year back to the back , and we have a dollar to do it , if it &apos;s about the right vaccine .
i think that &apos;s going to be changed by creating more than you &apos;re making vaccines in the world .
this is how the future might look like , with changes , can be accelerated today with synthetic bacteria , and perhaps , potentially , the most profitable .
we &apos;re just more effective from improving people from the way , and our goal is that we have a chance to survive a long time to survive for a long time . thank you very much .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s as far as it was , and for all those things that weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that was ever been addressed -- 27 miles across .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a second second of the universe -- and that to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we take images of these online detectors in detectors .
i &apos;m working on this . he &apos;s called a atlas detector -- 44 feet in the width , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction of this , and you see the scale .
at the 10th of september last year , the machine was going to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it caused huge amounts of music in the room room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first time that the entire distance around the lhc would be able to put together with a part of the lhc , to put a rain on the detector to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture at 10 september , we knew that the machine works , what &apos;s a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was created the biggest world &apos;s largest , or that , when someone was visiting google and the front page so that it was so found .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to the scientific .
and about a week later , there was a problem with the machine who had with these wires here -- these golden wires here here .
these wires are leading to the surface of the machine when the machine runs on the surface of the machine .
now , the engineers under them will look at them and say , &quot; no , no , they don &apos;t do it . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you &apos;re very cool , you will become called the water .
so , in minus 1759 , colder than the space between the stars , these wires can match tension .
in one of the connections between the surface of the chasm , there was a computer factory .
and so , it &apos;s just the wires that are going to be slightly , and they &apos;ve got the wires in the wires , and they &apos;ve suddenly got electrical resistance .
this was the result .
well , this is a wonderful thing , if you imagine that the magnets weigh over 20 tons of tons and to move around about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we called them new , more powerful .
they &apos;re all back to their way back .
and the lhc is going to be sued again .
we &apos;ll turn it out , and we &apos;ll expect first data in june or july , and we &apos;re going to move our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , on a kind of obstacle that accidents are also the debate that we have to use the value of science and engineering on such boundaries . it &apos;s easy to reject .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we reach beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words to a english scientist , and i &apos;m going to be happy , who , as i suspect , as he was the most interested in the world &apos;s trials , his grandfather was michael &apos;s , and he said , &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
books are my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big life , new love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that ever to change .
but a recent thing is a recent thing in my life , and my career has happened to me to rethink my relationship to this work .
this curious event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called a biography called the iliad , who , love , love -- decided to get different than all my previous books out of some reason in the world and a big , international cultural community .
the result is that , no matter where i &apos;m going , i &apos;m treated as if i was going to the end of the decline .
seriously -- the end of the end .
for example , you &apos;re going to get to me , and say , &quot; don &apos;t you feel that you &apos;re never going to be able to be able to be able to be able to do this success ?
don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re going to create your whole life and never again create a book that anyone in the world is interested ?
okay , that &apos;s what makes it courage .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago when i was a teenager for the first time , i was told that i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of art .
people said , &quot; do you have no fear of having success ? &quot;
did you not fear that the humiliation of a letter kills a letter ?
have you no fear that you &apos;re going to live for this craft and never get it to your life and you &apos;re going to die on a high-speed cold dream -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions : the real answer .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all of these things .
and i had always been .
and i &apos;m afraid , a lot more things that nobody would be a fibonacci one .
like algae -- and other scary things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it for recently , and ask me , why ?
is that sensible ?
is it logical that someone should be expected to do that , that he &apos;s going to do work to do the work that he feels ?
and what &apos;s happening about the creative union is going to be where they are , we &apos;re going to make us secure about the other mental quality -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemist and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist , when he was afraid of being afraid of being chemist .
with your baby , john -- how about it ?
it just didn &apos;t come to know , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists don &apos;t get the reputation of the &quot; unclear of the &quot; unclear people . &quot;
we tend to have this kind of call , but not only the writers , but the creative of all the ape , seem to have this reputation , mentally unstable .
everything you need to do is look at the bitter side of really great head of really great head from the 20th century , which died young and often from your own hand .
and even those who don &apos;t actually have been charged with their talents of their talents , they had really neglected their talents .
norman ornish : a little bit before his death in his last interview : &quot; i &apos;ve got a little bit more and killed me a little bit . &quot;
a remarkable statement that you can do about your work .
but we &apos;re not even exaggerating if we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve heard this kind of explanation since so long , and somehow we &apos;ve been wasting the notion of this , and we &apos;ve been accepting collective , and that art , and not ,
the question i want to ask today is : is this an idea for you to totally fix ?
feel that if you &apos;re in this case , because with one centimeter , i &apos;m not feeling at all .
i think they &apos;re learning .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how they get taken into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we encourage our big creative ability to live .
and i definitely know that it &apos;s for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , start to start this dark path of the idea of the most powerful way -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career .
that &apos;s -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 more training in me .
and it &apos;s very likely to say everything i &apos;m going to write from now from the world is the work that came from the world &apos;s work , right ?
i &apos;m saying it &apos;s a lot of the time , because we &apos;re all kind of friends here -- it &apos;s very likely to be my biggest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kinds of thoughts that you can get to the day , to be at 9 a.m. in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to .
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after a time of the most popular , i realized that i can continue to write a way of being able to build a kind of a kind of a psychological psychological construct .
somehow , i have to find out about a way to write a safe distance between me and my very natural , very natural , which is what the reaction is going to be like to write on .
while i &apos;ve been looking for models for the last year , i &apos;ve been looking for doing that , and i &apos;ve tried to find myself in the past , and i tried to find other societies to see if they could help better or more or more powerful
this is a search for me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will end up again .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of debilitating , which was from a distant , unknown source of people -- from the steel , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these divine twin centers of creativity , the demons of creativity .
from socrates , he believed that he believed he had a computer that he had to have on the rest of the day .
the roman had the same idea , called this kind of kind of a creative genius , a computer designer .
this is great . the roman didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical , divine creature , who was convinced that it was literally living in the walls of a football center -- about like the kind of glass , the most invisible , the most invisible and the artist in work ,
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s it , because it &apos;s the distance i talked about -- the psychological construct you &apos;re protecting you from the work of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked like this , right ?
the artist of the computer was protected by some things , like , for example , too much more questionable , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t see anything for you , everyone knew that you had this kind of thing that was made of this kind of thing that you &apos;ve been doing .
if your work is a job -- not entirely your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew your genius was something paralyzed .
so people in the west really thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s make the human individual in the center of the universe -- about all gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no longer a space for a mystic creature
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism and people started believing that creativity came completely from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people call this artists , or they &apos;re a genius -- instead of that he &apos;s got a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a person to allow me to think he &apos;s thinking , or she &apos;s like the vessel , like the stadium and the essence and the source of all of the divine , creative , unknown , infinite mystery is a little bit of responsibility
it &apos;s like asking somebody to swallow the sun .
the desired and distorted whole ego and it creates all these baskets to success .
i think that this is a very recent example of the last 500 years of the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe a ancient understanding of people and mystery of the creative return .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just eliminate the most rational , for 500 years , not just to eradicate a little rational talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would really be a scientific notion of concept , which is , in fact , -- -- basically -- -- the most powerful , people can explore and apply to their projects and so forth .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i &apos;m going to take is : why not ?
why not think about it ?
because it makes a lot of sense as anything that i &apos;ve heard of , when it was about , when it was about explaining the absolutely crazy thing of the creative process of the creative process .
a process that &apos;s known -- how everyone knows it &apos;s going to be something to do -- so in other words : actually , everyone here -- not always is a reasonable act .
in fact , it can feel really simple in the way .
i had a encounter in this kind of encounter as i met the extraordinary american poet , which is now about 90 , but she was all the way to the whole poet , but she told me that she was growing in the north of virginia , she told
she would be like a train train .
the land on them would be on their own .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under her feet to the quake .
she knew that she could just do one moment , and that was -- in her words -- in her words -- the devil race , the devil , the devil .
she ran like the devil to be tracking the house during this poem , and it was just about that she had to get fast enough to a sheet of paper and a pen , so she had to catch it when it was through her through it , and
in other words , she was not fast enough , and she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house and she didn &apos;t give it to the house , and she was going to be able to go through it , and she would
and then there were these moments -- the part i never forget -- she said that there were moments in which they were almost giving it .
so , she runs to the house and looking for paper and poem through her and it reaches a pen just as it goes through her and then -- she said -- she was like her other hand after that and put it on .
she caught the poem on his tail and she pulled it back into her body and took it on the sheet of paper .
and this is the picture that was complete , and the poem was intact on the paper -- but backwards -- from the last word for the first .
and i thought that i thought that was terribly -- that &apos;s just like my creative process is going to happen .
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i &apos;m a computer company . i &apos;m going to have to stand up every day to go up and sweat every day and i &apos;m sweating , and really awkward .
but even i have been able to reconstruct this thing sometimes .
and i guess that many of you have done that too .
even i had work or ideas that made me out of a source of mine that i really can &apos;t identify .
what is this thing for ?
and how do we do it with the relationship without the minds of what we have to lose , but even to keep in intellectual health ?
for me , the best living example of how to do this is to do this the musician tom &apos;s musician , i was allowed to interview him a few years ago .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? the most of his life was tom &apos;s embodiment of the embodiment of the modern modern artist that was trying to master this , and to deal with them .
but then he got older and quiet . he told me he was driving one day on a highway in los angeles , and there &apos;s everything for him .
he drove up with high speed when he suddenly hears a little patch of a melody that is often a lot of the way it &apos;s been made for him , and he wants to have it . it &apos;s a lot of the time , and he &apos;s not
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he didn &apos;t have a plastic machine .
so he starts to rise to this old , more ancient , like , like , i &apos;m going to lose this thing and be just tracking this song on forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of getting panic , he just stopped .
he finished all the fancy train and did something completely new .
he just looked at the sky and said , &quot; sorry , you can &apos;t see that i &apos;m going to drive my car ? &quot;
i see the way i &apos;m going to see a song , i &apos;m just going to tell you a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a second moment , if i can take care of you .
if not , you know , somebody else &apos;s rights .
go and tear down leonard cohen .
his whole process has changed after that .
not the work itself . it &apos;s still as dark as ever as long as ever .
but the process and the heavy , the heavy , which surrounds him , was being made of the genius where he was not having trouble and left him behind where he was doing it . he realized that it was not a single , more appropriate thing .
it could give a violent , unusual , bizarre collaboration , a conversation between tom and the strange , tangible thing that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit like i worked and it &apos;s been saved for me once .
this idea saved me as i was in the middle of the village of the village of the village , the same , loving love , love , love , and i fell in one of these these explorations that we all fall in when we &apos;re working on something
not only bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just be a project .
but then i remembered how tom had spoken in the free sky , and i tried it .
so i raised my view of the manuscript , and i talked to my comment towards a blank corner of the room .
i said , &quot; listen , &quot; listen , you &apos;re listening to , you know , you and i both know if this book is brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i &apos;ve got everything i have , i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to pop up here and follow your proportion .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , the hell .
i &apos;m going to write on , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you a point of diving for my part of the jobs here .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like following . in fact , centuries ago , in the deserts of the desert people have gathered into the deserts of the world with holy dances , and the music was placed -- until dawn .
these were a fixed , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , something special happened . one of the actors was actually a little bit more interested in the .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know that you &apos;ve seen all of your life in your life once .
it was as if the time was going to be the time and the dancer came through a kind of kind of a kind of a kind of plastic , and he did nothing different than he did before -- 1,000 nights earlier . but all added together .
and suddenly , he didn &apos;t seem to be in human beings .
it was lit up by the inside , and it &apos;s light down and everything is going on by a divine fire .
and so , when it happened , people knew what that was . they called it in his name .
they put together the hands and they started singing : &quot; aw leopold , supernatural leopold , &quot; supernatural , god , god . &quot;
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historical astronomical chords : when the most interesting thing came out of the world , they took this practice . the recommended changed in the course of centuries of the u.s. mistrust , supernatural , kazakhstan , the coal , which you still hear at the same time and
if a performer in spain does something worthwhile , something magical has done : the evidence-based prophet , the dairy dragline , the dairy , the supernatural , great , bravo , highly , very well , is a glimpse of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning when the dancers wake up and see that 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday is -- and he doesn &apos;t have a single story of god in his head .
he &apos;s just a aging , a breathing knee with a knee knee , and maybe he never gets up to those heights .
and maybe someone &apos;s name will call god &apos;s name , if he turns . but what about the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most powerful coordinates of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of authoritarian , if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of your own existence is coming from you .
if you may believe that you &apos;re a 10-year-old -- from a spectacular source of your life , your life is being passed on to someone else if you &apos;re done with it .
if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and i think i &apos;m thinking of security in the last few months , while i was working on the book , which is soon -- when the dangerous , frightening , strong , dear to my favorite success .
and i &apos;ve got to say all of you , if i &apos;m crazy , i &apos;m not afraid .
not boredom .
just do your job .
it &apos;s still for your contribution , whatever he is doing .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the dumb of eden &apos;s genius is to be asked to show a very short moment of wonder through your effort , then the most powerful , the sound of wonder !
and if not , still dance , but dance .
and the most powerful thing ! it &apos;s a lot of time for you despite that .
i believe in this and i feel that we should teach that .
so , the most powerful thing ! the case for you despite that , just for you , just that you have the mere human love and the most responsible for being there .
thank you .
thank you .
so , the aid .
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic sea industry , the arctic , for nearly three million years , had reduced the size of the lower 48 states to expand 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t push very much enough to get the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of ice .
in a sense , the arctic is the main world &apos;s chief &apos;s beating heart of our global health system .
it grows in winter and recovered in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a little bit of a business of what happened in the last 25 years .
the most powerful thing is with red marks .
as you can see , it &apos;s growing on the dark dark , and this is the annual ice in winter ; it &apos;s a summer in summer .
that so-called the so-called five years old , five years old , is almost like blood , which is from the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here .
this is a problem , because the warming of the frozen ocean is going to be the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s big amounts of carbon dioxide , which , when it &apos;s going to be done , of microbes , of microbes .
compared to the full amount of the body , the atmosphere could double if we cross this critical point .
already today in a flat lakes in alaska , methane methane from itself .
professor paravicini walter der walter is at the university of alaska , with another flat sea , and had been traveling last winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how will it be told us .
and one reason is , this enormous heat heat is rooted from north .
this is a year of a year .
but the volume is significantly bigger than ever before .
this is the most salient river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how sea level goes through the sea level , it &apos;s going to be flowing in the sea .
these rivers take a little bit more rapid .
the other thing at the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest largest world &apos;s largest population .
last month , researchers volunteered that the entire continent now has a negative food factory .
and the most popular , which showed up a few more of the data , is particularly in the melting .
this is a factor of 20 feet across , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the most prolific , you see the top new lakes , which were a few years ago , glaciers .
40 percent of all the people in the world are getting half of their food &apos;s license .
in the andes , this glacier is the most powerful for this city .
the most popular ones have been expanding .
but if you &apos;re going to get a lot of water , most of the water goes down .
in california , a 40 percent reduction of the sierra culture was seen .
this is the most powerful .
and the predictions of how they read them are seriously .
this is the whole world &apos;s population in the world , a dramatic increase on fire .
and the disasters all over the world have been in a really more sophisticated and previously unprecedented way of doing it .
so four times the last 30 years in the world &apos;s population .
this is a completely valid of the world .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s going to be like .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 , every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific , from the american continent western and both the indian national west , where there &apos;s a standard decline of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest one factor for global warming , next to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning from fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the nevertheless biggest problem .
the united states is one of the two largest largest species of food together with china .
and the proposal was to build many more more profound things .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that were burnt burnt down in the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the most popular and more responsible , a $ recent dollar last year to spend clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me about something .
to christmas , in tennessee , at home , in tennessee , a billion tons of plastic .
they &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is in our entire country of the u.s. economy of america .
this happened to christmas .
one of the commercials of the car &apos;s head was this .
the most powerful thing is a computer &apos;s , happy fellow .
there &apos;s a skin in skin and abundance of the americas , and it helps our economy to grow .
the most responsible , the most clean day is clean .
he &apos;s affordable and more responsible , and workers are staying in prison and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful thing is the head of the internet &apos;s head .
let me tell you a very clear thing . al gore , nancy forbid , harry &apos;am , you don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate change has been called two .
this is one , part of your .
in the most unequal , we see climate change as a serious threat for our business .
so we put it on the top of the top , a significant diagnostic policy to bring a major , a major amount of energy on the road to get the truth across coal .
the fact is , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it smells good also .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s leave it off .
so , coal coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean , clean .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean water .
and yet , the burning of coal one of the main reasons for global warming is that the remarkable clean of the world is that you see , changes everything .
look at it exactly , this is the problem today , clean , clean .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of the national security .
america is in a crisis that is the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread , which all connects this , is our dependence from the fuel fuel , like dirty coal and the junk oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to take us out of this kind of view .
and the u.s. peace is new percent of clean electricity , within the next 10 years .
a plan , america to take back to work , make us safer and help to stop global warming .
finally , a solution , the big enough , is to solve our problems .
the u.s. economy is new . find more .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a food of america .
one of the fastest ways of the old ways of the old , dirty fuels that are poisoning our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to make good pay jobs .
it &apos;s new america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
we have to come far , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start with you , to ask her childhood , when she played with a little bit of time .
while they realized how to cut the hands away and put them up , they were going to get to work and move , they actually learned to think and to solve problems through the understanding and to solve the future and to solve the future .
the spatial theory is closely connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the way of our interaction with real objects -- with my colleague , and my colleagues , and my colleagues , i started to wonder , what if we could use computers that moved to a flat , which is a digital form
this question was so emotional , we decided to use the answer and we had a very sophisticated approach .
shortly , a more interactive computer is a interactive computer in the size of a football system .
you can move with your hand , you can perceive each other , you can detect your movements and you have a screen and a computer and a computer .
much more importantly , are physically , why you can only move them out of the hands of hands and access to the hands .
and the most powerful one is an example of a new generation of engineering technology to manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools are being physical and a conscious awareness of their movements , they recognize each other and the intricacies of our brain experience with them , we can start with the exploration of new and entertaining problems .
i start with some simple examples .
this is the case of the design of the world , and if i put it into a direction , the video will go ahead and play it in the other direction , and i go backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other true .
so if i put them side-by-side , you make it care .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the city , you can see that and you can get something nervous .
and they feel also their movements and their propensity .
a interesting episode of interactions that we started to see was that we could apply everyday gestures on data , like color , like the kind of colors that you do with the fluid .
in this case , we have three main centers as a telephone company , and i can use them to fill color in the middle of where they &apos;re going to be mixed .
if we don &apos;t stop it , we can do a little bit more mature .
there are also some nice opportunities in education like languages , math or health , where we give people the opportunity to get the opportunity to get the people to get the odds and immediately see the results .
here i am ... this is a series of fibonacci numbers that i &apos;m doing with a simple kind of light .
this is a game with words that is kind of mixture of a mixture of a mixture of a mixture of a mixture of it .
basically , you get every round of the game on every single hand , and as you try to form words , that over a dictionary will be tested .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , you get mixed and you have a new kind of energy and new opportunities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came up with a trip to the media lab , and i could move it to try and take a video of it .
they really loved it .
a more interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
everything you have to say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest computer lab down there .
it turns out he wanted to just stack the internet test .
so for him , they were just just the only kind of light .
this is a interactive motivator .
we wanted to develop a design system for a computer company .
that &apos;s a word .
he can bring new characters into the scene by blowing the internet &apos;s license off the table , which shows this character .
here he is going to go the sun .
the sun goes on top .
now he &apos;s going to take a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the internet , and it can put them side-by-side , he can be able to interact with the characters ...
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open ends and he can decide how to evolve .
flying cat .
the last example i &apos;ve been doing now is to show you a little bit of a computer that we &apos;ve developed , which we &apos;ve developed recently and in the most responsible than a sound , like , bass and drums .
every four different variations ; you can pick up what you want to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can again organize in any patterns .
and you &apos;re going to be a little bit more fond of a game , just by holding a laser stick .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filters .
you connect it with a particular note and it gives it a lot of a smell .
and then more sophisticated effects like speed and volume that you &apos;re doing on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s look at it .
we start to go into the world we &apos;re going to go into two main fields and put these in a series , extend them and add a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass to it .
now i &apos;m going to do something else about it .
and now i plug the filter with the drums so i can control the effect of life .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by the speed of the one or another .
and now i plug the filter with the bass ; for something more expression .
i can put the sequence during it .
so i don &apos;t have to plan it in the front , but can be able to do it , and then , in the way , you can extend it or go ahead and cut it down .
and finally , i can break the whole sequence by keeping the air &apos;s head to the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my passion is to develop new media projects that are better to fit on how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new kind of new design and some of the possibilities that we work on in our lab .
the idea i want to give you to the way is that we &apos;re at the threshold of this new generation of interaction technology with digital media , which brings information into our world that we need to make our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to all of them !
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m very pleased to be there .
yeah , so what should be a good thing ?
i just have to step back to a little bit , and i &apos;m just busy doing the modern molecular biology .
i study biology and i &apos;ve been studying some of the years for a few years , and i started , because i just wanted to know , and i wanted to do it , and i wanted to do it in the study of interest .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity and i wanted to get closer to the matter , so .
i think that the molecular biology is generally spoken , so generally , biotechnology , everything you believe , synthetic biology and so on , on so on , so on .
extremely important , now , very important , and much more importantly , will be in the future .
there &apos;s so controversial , as we &apos;ve been able to genetically genetically engineered these things , plants in the water .
there &apos;s craig venter now in the u.s. industry trying to make the gas test , so gasoline from algae .
and then there &apos;s also things that are completely in the day-to-day life , which most people are not aware of , for example , for example , to wash us with 40 degrees laundry , also genetically genetically genetically engineered .
and the list can continue 400 times .
and so from that interest , that technology , i &apos;m just going to go on to this technology .
so what &apos;s a hacking ?
most people know the most people who are familiar with the most popular .
computers hack , and then it will always be in the media , yes , the hacker breaks somewhere and claws and so on .
so this is kind of sad for the most unfortunate , because it &apos;s not that true , which is what it actually has , and what &apos;s actually behind it .
and that &apos;s the way the most popular , in the 1970s , started with a plastic , and it &apos;s also the internet coming out of it .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and problem , that &apos;s not just technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a very simple thing , which is what things simplify , so any more basic one , a question , and how you can do it differently .
and it was just taken it to software , but there &apos;s also a lot of the software , there &apos;s also a whole kind of whole material that &apos;s going to do with the whole of the whole species of things .
and now , in the direction , in the direction , and i want to leave you with this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , that biology is actually a key code , because , the most powerful code is a critical code , which is the case ,
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program programming and you can also also put it up , and i found it incredibly fascinating , and i found that incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper with it .
this actually has taken a hundred really , eight really , really , that these networks .
there &apos;s a little bit of the dotcom dotcom , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with cooperation in india , but now members or active people around the world has been in the world .
these are a more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists , and philosophers and in collaboration with scientists are engaged in these technologies , and to make questions , and to try and process the creative , there &apos;s a lot of things .
but it &apos;s always about finding a kind of a light that &apos;s so valid , so a playful deal with it .
and then there &apos;s a little bit of the dotcom dotcom , the most powerful .
this is from the design of the network , which is actually more like a forum where where you &apos;re going to be talking about and talking online .
and these are a little bit more technical , and also a little bit of a little bit more nuanced , and then they &apos;re going to ask , yeah , immediately .
and from these networks that have done all the popular , it has been a scene that i &apos;d like to do just a bit of a sudden that i &apos;d like to do .
here in the upper left-hand , you see the most powerful , which is a kind of a school , so basically a kind of school , a private school , a nonprofit institution , where everyone can .
kids , old , all kinds of people go to the end of it , they have a lab and put them in the process , and look at what can do if these things are .
here &apos;s a group in indonesia , which is called the , but there &apos;s a lot of time to do it .
it &apos;s already more than these other two networks .
and they also have a sense of this artistic aspect of biological materials , and , yes , also , also , the kind of thing that we &apos;re doing is , they &apos;re kind of a little bit more nuanced , and they &apos;re combining it .
a group of bio-mimicry that i met a while ago , which is a little bit of a time , which is a lot of the time that you wanted to communicate the public , which is what they &apos;re learning in college , and they were doing so on
and i have a lecture on the other picture in copenhagen in the medical museum in the medical museum with an exhibition on the subject .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s mostly young people , but the only thing that one thing actually has developed , is this fascination on technology .
and what you can do with that , and also just put it on society to the society , and to ask , okay , what do you know what you want to do , you have interested in doing that ?
so , okay , to hack biology , you &apos;re kind of taking material .
you need biological materials , and you need tools , but it &apos;s then a lab .
and what you usually understand under a lab that are kind of a little bit more nuanced machines , extremely expensive , extremely , extremely distance , only for the very high , trained , trained academics with a ph.d. and so on .
and our approach was to say , okay , that actually , you don &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s not necessary , because every single one of the most common things actually evolved , and the most of the time that it &apos;s actually , is that it &apos;s really .
and it &apos;s the gentleman who was with this premise with this premise , and brian &apos;s university , in england , tried to put a computer factory , then a kind of a business , and then took a sense of a , a , a , a ,
so every one of the things that you &apos;ve seen is that it &apos;s going to be a little bit of a soup that he left , even before .
i then tried to take this back to my lab , a little bit of track , and then i bought it so much as a car , and i &apos;ve got a little bit of a little bit of a fan of the analysis , and so a little
now that &apos;s not supposed to be a joke , but it &apos;s not .
here &apos;s the picture in the picture , and you see the lab , in the blink of , so it &apos;s a kind of a kind of high-tech garage , which is the most powerful garage that the university of college has , a group in paris , which
and this is a little bit of the case that mentioned the first , which is , this is a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of conceptual biology in the principle of molecular biology .
and yes , you see , it &apos;s relatively relative , so there &apos;s a lot of people who are doing that for the time , so far to the larger , larger organizations that are going to do more and more more than that , they &apos;re already doing
but always the approach to that is that it &apos;s just going to be easy and accessible .
the first project we &apos;ve done as a international group , as we were sort of aware of ourselves , is right now , there &apos;s now as real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re all familiar with the people who always are engaging and so
and then , just from the most popular website of the founder , and he said , well , we have to really meet , and we have to really meet , and then , two events , and then it organized two events , and it &apos;s a couple
and then , there was also about , ok , who are we , what are we going to want , what do we want to tell ?
and what are our values and what are our endeavors , our basis ?
and then we have a sort of carbon system .
that was quite intuitive , so everyone has just so much wishes , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to move , and what it &apos;s going to be saying is , then .
and i think , i think , a very good code .
and then we have this , and that &apos;s not compulsory , but that &apos;s just , i think , has taken quite good , and i think it &apos;s pretty good to do that .
and we even tried to bring it back into the academic world , but it &apos;s not that way there is something like that .
so i think we &apos;re in the way we &apos;re in the process of the world , even a step further than the academic world .
so , what do we do now ?
a project i did with the most salient thing in switzerland was that we wanted to call a optical trap or optical swimmers .
this is when you focus a laser beam , on one in the room , you can capture little particles in the air or in the liquid and then move into this focus , so that &apos;s what a kind of a kind of a sign of principle is captured
this works really , in academic art , and we thought , okay , we might have a webcam , and we might have taken a webcam that &apos;s going to be cut down , and then you put a microscope that &apos;s blown around the lens , which is
this is what you see down there .
and then we have a torch torch , and the torch pulled out the laser and then tries to focus on this camera .
and that &apos;s not what it did , but we &apos;ve learned a lot about it yet .
so another project that from the french group from paris , that has shown , is pretty cool .
and it &apos;s like this , so this is a kind of a kind of a sign of a , so that , as a result , so it &apos;s been done with a little bit of a , so he &apos;s got to be engaged with the kind of
he then has this helmet , and he was building this helmet , and in cooperation with the museum .
then , there was the visitors in the room , and then they put on the chair , put on this helmet .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought or how they thought is , is then different lights in the room .
was a pretty nice project .
another thing from the united states , which is just to do with this kind of carbon that &apos;s been the most prolific , is the most threatening , which is the life-saving , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , reproduce , to reproduce , to reproduce , to reproduce , so you can make it visible .
so if i do this , the most popular thing to the scene in the crime scene , then they go there , and then they &apos;re going to collect any more basic , and then they can do this approach , and then they can say , okay ,
and the machines that make this kind of thing that are quite expensive , they &apos;re going to buy the most expensive , the cheapest euro go out of the wild .
and that &apos;s not a time of the most popular , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be a lot of it .
so this is just a application of many that you can do with it .
and they have two of these two builders , and they said , okay , we &apos;re going to do more and cheaper , and then we just made out of open source , so we have a source of open hardware , and they &apos;re now getting the cheapest
i think that &apos;s a hundred dollars or something .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely in a frame where it &apos;s clearly available .
so it &apos;s a very , very intimidating hack .
a project i had recently started to build a computer project .
so , the way that a kind of a kind of a design is , like a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a , or two inches , or so .
you squeeze the spray of water and then the most cosmopolitan , and then i put the camera on the pavement , and then i &apos;ve taken the crown and put it on the horizon that i did .
so the device you see there doesn &apos;t work .
but this is my prototype , which was pretty wild , so on a branch that was on this branch , the thing on the bottom , electronics on it and it was a pressure , but that was the pressure that was broken .
and then i took a laser , and i &apos;ve been connected to this .
a computer company , if you do the full of water , the price of pressure , so i think so 40 to the light bar , i think , is about to get about it .
and then you can speed up the particles that are strong enough and then go into the abyss .
and the commercial device costs about the size of the nest , or something like this , the 50 times the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically doable .
and this is the moment that it &apos;s just the core core of the scene , to increase these availability of technology and also the information and the information and the most powerful , that more people can get involved in .
because , as i said at the beginning , it &apos;s a very important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it , and also not a chance to make it really good .
because if you just read about it , it &apos;s not the same as you did yourself or you &apos;ve seen it yourself .
and i think technology is always becoming more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to meet some meaningful choices in society , and can join you , then you need access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it and you can do it and understand it .
and then the most successful thing then , under the open open , and citizen science .
so you can actually be able to put in the situation , and you can actually integrate with these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s the core core core of the world .
these are the people who have at least officially neglected on the website , the website website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and interesting is that they &apos;re also represented in southeast asia .
this is me , that &apos;s there , there are fewer people than they are in fact .
so i know about some that don &apos;t have patented .
and these are just the gothic people who are individual people .
in part , with these kind of neurons , these places put together .
and that &apos;s very much in the beginning .
like i said , &quot; i &apos;ve only started . &quot;
and the most powerful , the most popular , because the most popular thing in berlin was the first , the first , the first time .
and this is a gigantic network now , which is very good , and it &apos;s all over the world , and it &apos;s all over the world .
and we hope that we &apos;re going to be more and more like that , and then also similar to the other , so that there are more people being involved in it .
and i would invite everybody to deal with it and try and try and do whatever .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity , and you &apos;re going to stick enough energy , then you &apos;ll get far away .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hello .
how do we actually work ?
this is a question that i &apos;m very moving to as designers , but also in the area of the most , in the most competitive , and in front of all things in the area of user users .
and it &apos;s about how you &apos;ve seen people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and create it as a result of a very , very much more powerful experience .
because i think that the interactive media in us are engaging in our cognitive models , cognitive models , which have been a very , very , very , very , very appealing time , and that we can have been able to create the interactive media .
and this is very amazing because you actually believe that these are the most powerful things you &apos;ve been looking at , which is actually the future , but actually it &apos;s like the future is just in us , in our own root roots .
now , what are actually actually more nuanced models ?
i &apos;ve been writing four more and a half of the details of this .
to be cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we &apos;ve been redefining in the pre-industrial times .
to these twin models , we heard that we have a basically natural relationship to virtuality .
this sounds basically unusual .
i &apos;m going to take you back to the same , and you &apos;ll prove you to prove that you have a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second aspect is that since this kind of carbon model , we &apos;ve never been able to speak very , very , very loud , even though we &apos;re using a more recent language today .
and the third area is actually explaining by itself .
we all know that the interactive media is about definition of what the denial of the agreement involves , and what of course tells us that we are experiencing the implications today as normal .
the fourth point is that the story of us is a place of the world &apos;s worth of view .
now , as it is with the virtuality , that &apos;s actually the most basic thing in the world .
i want to show you that .
how many doors have the house that they live in ?
and we can &apos;t immediately answer them , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
they go through this house through this house , in the field of water , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they &apos;re the reality and they &apos;re very much the same .
fantastic , right ?
and we &apos;re looking at the most useful for example , for example , the virtual reality in our business process , and we can actually do this all the time .
and this kind of wealth that the virtual reality is the reality that people have needed in the opposite times , because they had nothing to do .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any more inclusive .
they had no media media .
the only thing that had had the head was her head .
and in this head , the memory was the .
in this head , the whole illustrator and this virtual images , the imagination , was also being passed to know .
and so it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with the virtuality of virtuality .
the interesting thing about this is when i can make a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s going .
the interesting thing about this is that at the time of human beings , the same thing was to be the same thing .
now , if you think about it , you &apos;re going to go on .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i &apos;m going to talk about that again .
the fundamental tool of the computer &apos;s population has been thought of it .
and the preacher , priests , so-called so-called , were more disconnected , to keep knowledge in stories .
and today , we &apos;re still very , very strong at stories .
the author of the book of the book , jonathan ornish , is , we &apos;re still a year of research hours of the story of stories .
this means for a child that it has to be spent for the most of the time that the most common of the life has been spent with the most cosmopolitan of stories .
now we think our love to stories depends on the fact that we have sat on the lap of our parents .
no , no , no , no .
this is going to go back to the cultures of the second time .
but for me , in the field of interactive media as particularly impressive , we have a se in our biological memory , the ability to think of a se .
i brought you an example of the north american tribe of the world &apos;s land .
and the life lived in the most ancient of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very , very crude area , and you had to navigate there , from island to island to get food .
and they did this with so-called so-called so-called called the &quot; water . &quot;
you may know , if you &apos;re interested in a little bit of the australian native americans .
they have similar principles .
they have no food , but they &apos;ve used the kind of plastic that they have , or also , even more sophisticated .
and what that is about the interesting thing is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be mapped over songs .
and that &apos;s what the language is about to be rendered in the process of the language .
that means you &apos;re going to be tuned over sound and rhythm .
and this sounds and this rhythm , the geology , is shown the topography of a region , and it also enabled that , of course , that you could put these songs and put them together and go back to the left , and then again to go back
why don &apos;t we sing to get from a to b from a to b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
this is what happens to the carbon project .
we &apos;ve moved to the so-called so-called called the &quot; s . &quot;
and the project is happening , and it &apos;s the book and happens , and it &apos;s the book of the book .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens , that we have the responsibility for our memories and the ones that have changed its individual terms of our individual memories .
and on the book , and on the picture .
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of god to be a bit more powerful .
bullying has become alien forever for us , and it has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous killer of the day , is so far to say that these mass media channels , he says the book and the image , so the internet , the internet , and so on , what we call a mass of media today , have
let &apos;s make a little bit of a video .
from the most responsible to the machine .
what has the impact on our thinking and our memory ?
then the most powerful thing is the opposite of the world &apos;s .
and they &apos;re going to have been over the course of centuries and more and more of the time that we have in the world .
that means instead of listening to us , we have a vital , common spread , in masses of memories that we can depend on our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more ourselves .
we have an abstract language , a fixed language .
we don &apos;t think of the thing that we don &apos;t have in pictures anymore , but we &apos;re going to do it in the language of our language .
we &apos;ve used to get that things linear .
and we have the implications as a law , and there are only exceptions , like the most common .
what &apos;s left is the most powerful thing .
we still are the most prolific than a very , very , very arrested .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
we had the most powerful , we had the project , and we &apos;ve got this project , and we &apos;re now called the so-called model of the machine .
and it sounds very , very much , and it sounds very , very much about science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of the design of the world that bring us back to this possibility of finding our skills back to the other .
there &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about the most cosmopolitan , it &apos;s about the most cosmopolitan .
i want to explain a little bit about it .
there &apos;s technical concepts like the augmented reality , which is the extended reality .
so if you look at google , for example , it &apos;s a concept that makes us combine the virtual world with the real world with the real world that &apos;s going to be the virtual world , the virtual , as something that is a normal , natural ,
another example is that so-called virtual reality .
so crazy , of course , in my talk , i think that &apos;s how we sound physically , because we &apos;re moving in the realm of the existing , virtual worlds , very much after the model of the computer model .
and other examples are the most powerful , smart systems .
these are rooms that can respond to a human being .
all this needs the ability to accept our fundamental ability , virtuality as a real habitat .
i &apos;ve been in the course and i hope that video works , a very , very beautiful project , that &apos;s the most powerful of michael gardner , the most cosmopolitan , and the most energetic , and the most powerful .
and the two main ones are also here today .
maybe you can stand up a minute , so you can get up to the two of the project .
and this project i brought as an example of how again , again , that &apos;s been interpreted with this kind of carbon , cognitive models .
the whole thing is , i have to say that .
what the most powerful thing of course and it is , of course , is a computer game .
and if i say computer games , they probably have very likely to have people in front of some people , some people who play people from some of the most common things , or they &apos;re playing with some of the other things in the hand .
anyway , they do that in the way .
this is a game for out .
and that &apos;s what i thought was very , very much , i think , the world &apos;s outside world , so i discover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data that we produce , the world &apos;s real world .
i apologize that i must adapt so much .
you can explain that much better , there &apos;s more than that , there &apos;s more than that .
and it &apos;s about that i discover a city by looking at what the places were positive or negative .
and so i get a whole different view of the city , a very different impression , which is i see negative and positive zones of a city and getting a whole different , virtual map of a very real city .
and we can now look at this .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you &apos;re seeing .
of course , this virtual world in walls are in our cities , and it &apos;s clear .
and with a kind of flashlight we can make this virtual worlds .
so , i &apos;d like to conclude to conclude my talk and the sense that the qualities and the skills we &apos;ve been acquired from the most responsible , and we &apos;ve gone out to be a little bit more nuanced in the project , and that &apos;s what we
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be in you .
i &apos;ve been wondering if this bag is there , and i &apos;m going to talk to you , and i &apos;m going to talk to you .
it won &apos;t do that .
i &apos;m also going to come back to what &apos;s inside .
but i just do it just a little bit of weird .
yes , kids are inherently curious or should be curious , designers too .
i &apos;m a creator of the house , so i &apos;m also doing the issue of curiosity and how the curiosity are changing again , and why we &apos;re losing it , and why we might have to be able to be more curiosity and so on .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re looking at next to the actual way of thinking about the real way .
if professors are being curious , they &apos;re often going to be in the n of the n .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half year .
a key issue to the subject natural user interface .
now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are the most powerful designers on the way that we &apos;re going to do so natural , the interaction of communication , interaction and so on .
and i &apos;m just going to take one of these little devices up because things are always becoming more intuitive , increasingly natural , and there &apos;s no way you have to look at what &apos;s actually about humans , which is the most exciting or intuitive .
and before the background , i &apos;ve been to the natural user interface in the field of natural user , so the next generation in the human computer is in the relationship of human computers in the relationship of the human computer , and how our tools change the computer
so i &apos;ve been busy doing this when it &apos;s , of course , intuitive .
maybe you have to look at it again .
why does that happen at all ?
so if we look at the development of our society , a short bit of this , we &apos;re moving from the third of the fourth , or the fourth of the third , or a second .
so from the modern in the world .
every society is shaped by a long-term form .
the first time the language is through the language .
that means you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve talked to a common language , you could communicate with each other , and it &apos;s moved into the same cave or in other areas , or in other areas , cities and it has been created as well as a tax
but the language was the language , but a lot of a lot of natural , something very natural .
you had to learn , so not a one-hour thing , but we &apos;re learning about nature , but we &apos;re learning to do it .
that was then been fooled by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a computer company , because of course , because of course , the living language began to manifest the form of script , which is what &apos;s called the thing that &apos;s going to be , and i &apos;m going to start and put it in stone and
and as i go to the end of the day , and when i &apos;m going to be a , it &apos;s a very different coverage of , when there &apos;s a living , it &apos;s like a living .
but then , the same thing was , the script was going to be a little bit of a reaction , and then i was going to go .
then the next generation we actually have primarily is in the life of life .
this is just the pressure and print the background of the script with miriam and others .
it was just a kind of a rock company where the other side , the other side , and the other people who have said , are really insane if the people start reading , then they want to be a lot of the time , and that &apos;s completely
and now we come to the next generation and the exciting , so a kind of a child &apos;s only a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this particular phase phase that we &apos;re going to do .
so , of course , the confused us , because we look at the one side that uses new media , social media , and so on .
with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what the old thinking is , don &apos;t say that in the most ancient , and no beef is more or more , or other phenomena , i want to just be able to do this , and i
and these two worlds just fires together , new and old thinking .
so the exciting thing about this is when you look at this , this new society , these kind of plastic , a lot of mechanisms , is very many basic mechanisms , principles and the sun &apos;s paradigm from the most responsible .
but now not more in the local level , but in global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the subject of ecology is a global .
not when i think there &apos;s a local color and the neighbor thinks less of the pain , it &apos;s not going to work .
that means that from the local village , it &apos;s actually become a global village with the same principles , and of course , the total transparency , but also the total transparency .
so as you knew in the village , who has what , who has what , and when , this is what this is happening today , of our self &apos;s data , through this mobile surface .
it &apos;s that we know globally , and we &apos;re getting more and better and better and better .
so , like it was happening on the village , it happened to be on the village .
before the background , i just got to look at what &apos;s called , &quot; well , what &apos;s it for us , &quot; what is the most important thing for us , what is the idea of what we might do , but what does the difference make ?
because often people are coming , they can &apos;t do it , so that they can &apos;t do it .
so you have to engage with what is called , and not just change it , it &apos;s going to change it , but it &apos;s going to be better .
and when of course , it &apos;s something intuitive and how i can do it as a creator of how to do it , and just make the things that you can make a more intuitive , so you &apos;re just intuitive , because you &apos;re doing fun and you
you &apos;re looking at the degree of the study , and the subject of perception and the most powerful .
and of course , that &apos;s what you start and look at and look and say , okay , now i just look at the inside self .
and what &apos;s it like in this ?
so how do we work if we &apos;re going to get out of there ?
and what does it mean , of course , intuitive and how do our channels work of perception and how does the cognitive process process ?
because steve jobs said , you know , you &apos;ve got a lot of the air care for you to get to the test of the day .
so you really have to look at the details , if i want to make something more intuitive or intuitive , which is what it does in the core .
and you can see that you have a seven senses , most of us think , now , right now , that &apos;s seven , because certainly there &apos;s seven , there &apos;s certainly the next future , and as an extension of our self , the next thing to
and look how we &apos;re going to process information , how do we take information ?
just say , what is information ?
information is a difference , and it &apos;s a difference .
many of them use the word , but it doesn &apos;t really mean what it means .
but i have to understand in the core , in the nature of understanding information , when information is going to know information and information , and i know how to do things from coming to the other hand , and of course , i can make sure of things
and of course , design is influence on perception .
we see this when i do things , and then i can make them confusing how to do it on the right , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can make them intuitive , by showing things .
so much natural , it &apos;s a little natural , but i look at the same , where it &apos;s salt and pepper .
and if i tell someone , give me salt or pepper , then he &apos;ll be thinking about the right thing , where it &apos;s in .
and the left just intuitively access and then hopefully that no sugar is in the inside , the salt just made up to you .
but also our perception itself , as it does , as it does .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks taller than the little , although it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just as big as the case , and yet our perception changes , depending on what context we do .
anybody know what that is ?
strike on .
the other thing is , it &apos;s going to work .
there &apos;s a little bit of my glasses .
so it &apos;s n .
a second circle is starting to match certain similarity or associate .
and then if i take a more fancy , and then we &apos;re not just seeing a unit , which is the circle , circle and , and we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle , a different circle .
it &apos;s called the kind of water , or you &apos;re just going to be able to get that in perception , and also that &apos;s what affected us in perception .
and the most important thing for the designers that most of the time , most of the time , is the great semester .
so , the equivalent of the continuity , the continuity of the continuity and so on .
and then often , again , forget again .
but this is an essential component , if you want to make things like that , you know , to make things like that .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting , is the image of this project .
and it sounds very banal , but it &apos;s exciting to be very compelling , but it &apos;s very exciting to be done .
so we have the eyes on the front , and now you think we &apos;re looking at the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you see , you see from the back of the back .
because they &apos;re a sense of the front of the front that they see something you see , the circle of what they recognize .
that means we &apos;re just seeing our view before we see it , and then we see it back after the back of our online , to say , okay , okay , okay .
i have this kind of cognitive belief , you have what you want to see .
and that &apos;s then that comes back again .
then it goes back to the front , because the back of the front , it &apos;s not going to say , well , look at the way you &apos;re going , and sure , you &apos;re going to look at what you &apos;re seeing , which is what you
and then it goes back back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually going to be seen .
so a very , very , very , very , very reactive process just how certain things happen and what &apos;s happening for the world &apos;s disease .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s seen this picture .
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve described .
now , everyone &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who sees what you see .
does anybody see something special ?
a computer system , right .
if i saw that that there &apos;s a little bit of a car in there , you know that .
you &apos;re never going to forget about it , because i &apos;m going to show you where the most important thing is .
now you see the most salient .
and further , you &apos;re always seeing it .
so , i actually have them out of this , and i actually don &apos;t know that they don &apos;t recognize any patterns , but i have them in a very short time , again , again , again , this dog in this obscure picture .
and this is the projection of the scene , the brain projection , looking at it .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m going to go forward to the front of the day .
i see the most salient .
so , very exciting , very exciting , which then is , yes , is not , but here in this sort of mass mass , just to work on this kind of mass mass .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as designers .
if i know something takes three seconds , until i kind of look out of the present , i can just bridge very well , in which i &apos;m doing it by taking a full age of time .
it &apos;s got to process it as a present .
then it goes into the past and so i can bridge very elegant to the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
what does the milliseconds take out ?
yes , milliseconds .
it &apos;s a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time where you love .
that means , realizing , if you know that , you &apos;re paying attention to who you look at how long you &apos;re looking at , because i don &apos;t have a gun for what can happen .
and a little bit of milliseconds , a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time of most of the perceptions that we have .
that &apos;s what happens to this first impression in a rapidly fast speed , as we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at and how we &apos;re kind of recovered against our environment so that we can think about it .
of course , the creator of the perception of the perception and neural is not just the subject of sensory tissue , but certainly , of course , with the subject of the brain .
so , like a human being , it &apos;s about a certain thing .
there &apos;s a practical mechanism that &apos;s more practical , so the other things that are like the other thing , or the other aspects of the world .
there are a lot of the time where i know exactly where i have to reach .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why does anybody have a little bit of a little bit of a brain , where not a little bit of a little bit of a body , so that &apos;s not what &apos;s going on , so that &apos;s not so practical
we &apos;re more on symbolic , on the dna floor , which we &apos;re looking at as a creator of course .
back to my actual subject of natural users , and the subject of what , of course , also , is the most ambiguous thing .
so , the way i think about it is always how to get a certain goal or how to get a user in a certain position of food , efficient and kermit a goal .
it &apos;s the norm that it &apos;s like .
how do i make something more like that ?
i can do it directly or need to do &quot; n manual , &quot; i need to have a more of that .
and less of the time , or more of the time , is it .
that i just do that , and make it beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better to do it .
you have to understand that .
and then if you &apos;re part of the software we &apos;ve seen , it &apos;s going to be , you know , what you &apos;re seeing , you know , why 99 percent of our software is intuitively intuitively , or not to use the software in many areas ,
it &apos;s not just an intuitive video of science , not only for apple &apos;s favorite , a fundamental example of the human body , if i want to make technological devices to make the human material .
why ?
because in the rule of this new kind of view , the natural user of the world , the natural user , are about five times more than the average of our goal .
you have to imagine that if you do something of classical energy , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , just one hour .
it doesn &apos;t mean that you probably can go home four hours , but your employers , or anybody , will have a way to go on to the four hours .
but i want to say that it &apos;s for us to do a more recent amount of information , also to make some things .
and then when we go back into the field of software , this is the first line of interface that were very abstract , where you &apos;ve taken months to deal with these systems .
then the next one , the next , brain algorithms , or mental model , would have been working on the software , which is , you know , you &apos;ve worked a notion of something that metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to make the computer sustainable .
so , not more zeros and ones or the code code , but just a metaphor .
this is all the way that it was much more powerful , but it &apos;s actually much better .
the next generation of mathematics &apos;s computer work is very much more with behavior .
so , i &apos;m making a lot more often , as a creator , a lot more often than the behavior .
this is also a shift shift .
and that &apos;s the point that i &apos;m going to look at the success of the success , just the most successful one .
and if i take a step back into this natural user interface , where i &apos;m a voice , by language , by a visual language , a touch , and not a mouse and the same thing , i have to control the things , and then i &apos;m
but that &apos;s also what leads me to the point when things are actually becoming intuitive ?
if you become an intuitive and then i have to be educated , and i &apos;m going to take a look at what &apos;s going on , and what does it mean from the point of view of the brain , when is it really something that &apos;s really intuitive
and that &apos;s for us to be a little bit of intuitively intuitively , if i have to think about it .
so he doesn &apos;t like to think , it &apos;s just going to be done to the standards .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for designers ?
so that means that if we look at existing growth of a little bit , we can put existing resources on something else , for example , the metaphor , i can do this as a creator .
that means i can actually transmit a kind of intuitive human body , and make the software more powerful .
and of course , the question of what is the most important thing about people and now i &apos;ve been telling you .
this is called the so-called design .
and that &apos;s what everybody &apos;s used from us and we &apos;re doing a constructive and is a constructive , and it &apos;s to be seduced , more inclusive , more advanced , more advanced .
it &apos;s all of you all the time , but it &apos;s the unconscious and it &apos;s kind of intuitive , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive or instinctively .
the model is already going to be a lot of the womb in the womb and is the way it works in the world , and it &apos;s used by young and old , and it &apos;s used by us all the time without most of the time that this
and the most powerful thing about it is about 50 to a half of us ever , and so in the sleep , you &apos;ve found that it &apos;s less often more common than the day .
i can now actually get these mental folk signals , and they &apos;re more inclusive , to get out of a computer system .
and through this kind of transmission , similar like the metaphor of the interstate , now not more than a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a network of a network , a single , a laser .
and this is on a higher radius of the oil of the human being , which is the most human metaphor .
and if i &apos;m going to get this out of the way that i &apos;m going to get out of the way that i &apos;m a conscious , the way that i &apos;m a , you know , it &apos;s a choice , and it &apos;s a little bit of
then i can transmit the whole .
i try and do this through a number of examples .
and indeed , they eat pies .
so , i &apos;m going to be interacting with the object , and i can zoom back to the object again .
i get the whole of all the whole of all the time , and i can actually start to do this , and can tell me just all the things that i &apos;m going to do with chocolate .
and once again , a interface , which is much more intuitive and much more natural .
because , because i can reach the things like the bits , and you can come to me , and you can get more natural than the formation of copernicus , or other mechanisms of the other mechanisms , or other mechanisms of things that are kind of accessible to
imagination is more powerful , and with this sentence , i want to close to the end , a and again , a , and also , designers have to think differently , to come to new solutions , and thank you in that sense of mine .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first one , if you &apos;re a kid , is the big thing that you &apos;re going to take care of what you have , yes , and the only thing that you have , and the only one that you have , you know , is given your
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn to learn .
so all of that is , and they &apos;re curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m going to take it to this whole kind of thing , and it &apos;s basically the whole kind of energy , and it &apos;s a 40 years of doing it , in quality of it .
and there &apos;s a central point of this .
and it depends on phosphorus .
give a chance .
every day you give out , you give them scale , you have to take 50 grams of phosphorus , and every day you have to take two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could just glide as a himba of the world &apos;s atmosphere .
if we did not take any phosphorus and give it a chance .
so , amazingly , we &apos;re so concerned about this , which is actually what we &apos;re doing , but not that .
because all of you talk about energy , but nobody talks about the most responsible .
the most critical thing is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have the phosphorus and we &apos;ve been doing a lot more uranium in the world , and we &apos;ve got more uranium in the environment than it &apos;s used in all nuclear plants .
in the last 20 years , the previous tons of uranium are distributed to our fields in germany .
and we take it all up .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , the environment , go down less cars .
the environment , the environment , make less waste .
the environment , the environment , less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
this is like , if i would say , you know , you know , you get your child , it &apos;s three times five times five .
this is just a little less destruction .
if we think about the norwegian , we think of our whole earth sooner , or later a cemetery .
that &apos;s why the norwegian to think about the norwegian .
and the most important thing about this is to look at the soil as first .
in the ground , over 60 percent of the world &apos;s population is stored .
now , we &apos;re building corn and we lose between 11 and 30 kilograms of 30 tons per hectare , or also in the square meter .
that means we &apos;re losing about five times more than a new way of being new .
we can actually look at the world &apos;s climate system .
and everything is packaging or content .
for example , in the most responsible , the most prolific 20 percent of the world &apos;s population is now meen .
and because we &apos;re getting older , it will be bigger .
this is actually all in the most violent .
yes ?
one baby needs about six hugs .
we could reduce that for 10 percent , but what does it do ?
that &apos;s going to live in china in a second .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go with this y2k ?
and one of the evidence of that is that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be emitted in the very stable components of the solid components .
in the people over the urine .
yeah .
so , with that , men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what it is , right ?
traditionally , we think in the world &apos;s office , we &apos;re too many on the world .
and if you get people to exist , if you &apos;re to exist , if you say that it would be better , you &apos;re not there , you &apos;re going to be a lot of the time , you &apos;re going to be tuned and hostile .
and so someone like al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more profound than the human population stabilize .
in israel , you say , if you live a lifetime , you &apos;re going to be the earth .
here it says , the more you &apos;re going to be more likely .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh about four more than we humans .
i could also take termites , but in the united states nobody like termites , so far , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means the ants weigh much more than we do .
and because they work much harder than we and because they &apos;re only three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in their weight , in the energy consumption , something 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you &apos;re going to see how far we are , what really would we achieve and how sad we are , we &apos;re at all on earth , you can see that for example , there &apos;s a program that &apos;s going to be a program , until
you can only be more accurate if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
the only chance .
have you seen a tree tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means we want to be waking up as trees , yes ?
yes ?
no tree is a tree .
luckily , not , yes ?
there &apos;s no street on trees .
there are still six billion trees in the recycling of it .
you &apos;ve heard about the trees of trees , you know , from trees ?
that means all our intelligence means that we want to wake up as trees .
and where you see , even in something like sandor , the most marginalized biological , agriculture is not allowing our own food .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus , which would really have to go back into chains .
and so we &apos;re too many .
alone .
that &apos;s what we feel so guilty about on earth that we say , there &apos;s no standard , no more , no , no , no , no , and as you can all say , our own shells go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , which is the oil spill .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , it &apos;s the highest , right ?
so , yes , yes ?
you can only have the only time if you &apos;re not there .
even if you &apos;d shoot , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can back our nutrients back .
we &apos;re doing agriculture in brazil where we go back to the nutrients .
so , right , we can get nutrients in this way , and it can be safe in agriculture .
we do that in china for example , where we &apos;re taking the waste of it .
in china , a more common thing is still called a more expressive , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid , our nutrients .
that means that the entire western city system is made of it , that the city has always taken off , but the farmers never have a little returned .
so the cities had to grow more and more because the farmers went to cities and the cities kept going to go away their nutrients .
so all of the western rich rich are increasingly expanding , until they don &apos;t have the infrastructure , and they &apos;re the mining industry .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done a lot of the time of five thousand years , because you &apos;ve always been able to get nutrients to the ground .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat in china , you &apos;re expected to be the food that you &apos;re going to be looking for until you &apos;re looking at the toilet .
because it &apos;s a very misleading to go and put nutrients .
you have to have invited them to eat it , not for the most successful .
that means you can see the internet , how you can get rid of nutrients .
it &apos;s actually nice to do that , so agriculture is power , manure , it &apos;s made up on a hectare of land with five people in favelas , and the plant is a farmer &apos;s license , and the plant and the vegetables and the fish and the
and the great thing about this is that the most popular news is in the favelas around the favelas .
so we don &apos;t need to control people , and we have to be very bad .
we can support them , well to be good .
this is of course , of course , the skin service , but the plants carry themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by the design that a farmer can just navigate .
that means that the food industry goes back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve now built over the world &apos;s worth of data in the last 20 years , not one of those facilities ever became a more inclusive .
you could just just get a liter of a liter of water , and then the plant would be ruined over years .
don &apos;t find .
that means we don &apos;t need to control people , too much , too much .
we can support them , well to be good .
that means we need to have phosphorus growth .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you &apos;re going to write on the best of the bacteria &apos;s top treatment of all the fuel treatment .
unfortunately , not in the most responsible , but maybe you can help the most successful thing in the way .
because the most powerful plant could be the phosphorus back .
and that must go back .
we see that phosphorus really is critical .
and we see that it &apos;s really possible .
we &apos;ve been using this over three years now .
the dutch government has explained , they will be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need this whole thing .
you know , there are two countries that are controlling almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
there &apos;s a bunch of a bunch of plastic types .
these are the most popular countries that control 40 percent of the oil industry .
and the oil is going to replace us through other energy spills .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace you .
so it &apos;s not about making the existing one less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s especially about questions , which is the right thing .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , of course , you can understand that easier because in holland , the country is building on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if you &apos;re sad for the woman , if you were upset , and you get to 50 kilocycles .
very inefficient .
but , in fact , it &apos;s effective , right ?
or take a teapot .
a woman in germany eats three kilograms during her life .
it &apos;s about that .
this isn &apos;t a scientific thing that &apos;s not accurate because we don &apos;t know how much more powerful it is .
but a teapot , even at that lighting , can i tell you , is completely inefficient , but it &apos;s very effective , right ?
one thing that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
questions , what is the right thing ?
not to burn a little bit better , and it &apos;s a little bit better to lose and lose it all the materials for the chain of chains , but first of all , how do you make the cycles ?
so , you can imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i go to dinner , and i say yes , there &apos;s a pill with a plastic camera and a glass of water to do it .
wonderful , &quot; there ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything in life is not efficient . it &apos;s not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything in life counts is not to save , to avoid reducing .
all the whole water .
we say the people , oh , yes , you don &apos;t have a green one in the south .
no , it &apos;s just the right thing , right ?
in every place where you &apos;re going to be a , you &apos;re going to get back to the ground .
but the wrong things .
if you put the wrong things , you have a water company .
in how we think about north .
there &apos;s every footprint there .
if you walk , yes , everybody &apos;s breathing the floor .
because the bottom is going to die , and the wind is going to get off the ground and the water is turning away .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint , that the water is longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that is going to be a poacher .
not a lot of time .
we &apos;re in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask you how to do it , how do you get this to your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , &quot; i &apos;m going to go , &quot; yes , &quot; right ?
that &apos;s just the minimum map .
so not saving , steal , avoid .
every waste is alive .
and it &apos;s a lust when you see in italy , like people in the high bow , who have dropped in the high bow , to get out of this .
because you know , this is a kind of a design process .
it &apos;s a form of a form of mass , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please beautiful .
we &apos;ve developed a design system , for example , that is in room temperature .
you can throw them off , where they go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re building all over .
and it contains seeds from rare plants so that they can engage by the diversity of biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so it &apos;s two chain points .
not all of it should be the farm .
a television machine or a washing machine , they &apos;re just using them to use them .
just the things that the most powerful , like the magic of how , like , like , like , like , the way that they have , they have to go to biological systems .
the things that are used only to go into technical systems .
but today , we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the ted system , yes ?
and it &apos;s very direct , and it &apos;s not for the company enceladus , but for that , that they &apos;re now helping this company to make these products successfully .
because we don &apos;t do things more freely .
yes ?
so , if i &apos;m going to eat them , and i &apos;m going to say that &apos;s free from the food , then you don &apos;t help it .
no , we &apos;re stuck in what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like the magic system .
not toxic in it .
it &apos;s all in that in it , it &apos;s useful .
these are the first shoes that you can take on the top of the mountain , and the rubber in biological loops can go , right ?
everything is the farm of the body .
and if it &apos;s possible , we can do it for disagreement , for nike , for the security industry , for the coal industry , and the whole textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the world &apos;s most popular world companies that will cause the textile industry .
so , you help , ask , ask , for people .
hey , elevators , are you really serious ?
because now , the average of the world has changed twice the time .
and i &apos;m not sure whether you really get a really serious job .
so , help me do a little bit .
but it &apos;s about .
yeah .
that &apos;s what has been shown .
this is going .
we can do things like this , that if you break out , if you break , you can put it in biological loops .
technical loops are just as much as there .
there &apos;s a direct thing for this .
this is the first commercial backpack , actually , that &apos;s done for that in the cycle .
so , in every store , you can put things together .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the lamanites still ?
if it &apos;s in the moment , the waste is .
all over the day , this y2k is all around .
in the countries where people are coming to money .
there &apos;s a lot of time on the street , but in the landscape , yes , right ?
if we change the plastics , so that in biological systems , if we change the world &apos;s energy , the inside , you can actually get back to the ground , then you can do with a baby in israel , or in tunisia .
yes ?
if you take these of the life-saving bias , they &apos;re picking up , and they &apos;re taking the powder , and they can take the powder to plant trees .
so this is the baby &apos;s baby , for the whole life , from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be more inclusive , we can be more biased .
it &apos;s kind of a double plate of a rock project .
yes , so .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can still reinvent everything .
i started a institute .
now , there are many people working there , and they can get all of them .
there &apos;s extra a phone , and there &apos;s a phone , where everybody can join .
so no longer save , stealing , reduce , not a , not a , not a , but smart waste .
does it make it curious ?
thank you .
the work of the computer .
music as language .
in the description of my talk , i wrote that i was a computer officer , so i was a computer , so in english , in english , understanding .
the name of the written grades are the written notes in short music .
that you don &apos;t just have a word for word for the text in another language , but also the deeper sense of words and the most powerful sense of words , so that it &apos;s a useful translation to do , everybody knows it &apos;s going to do with
in fact , from the german to the english in english , more knowledge can require , it &apos;s much more important when you go to poetry or even poetry .
but it &apos;s alien , but it &apos;s very alien for the poles of what we do with our online team .
as a result of a computer , i first had the written notes .
they &apos;re sure that the composer in the notes has exactly everything that he has been remembered .
in fact , the notes are very vague and unforgettable .
these notes are about the same or indirectly , as a verbal verbal , as well as a verbal self , description of a landscape .
because in this verbal verbal condition , the smell of flowers is not smell to smell the degrees of the carbon system just to hear the key of the animal &apos;s rights , not feeling .
this means the genomic phenomenon has to be the most powerful , which is the most important , which is a different , concrete , non-verbal , non-verbal food .
today i want to give you what i would say otherwise , so that &apos;s a verbal language , which is a verbal language .
so basically , a translation of translation .
so i &apos;m going to pull it up to the whole , and i &apos;d like to do it all the time , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be equivalent to the translation of translation .
so the music works for me so much as the spoken language .
the main notes have the function of the letters of a script .
so it &apos;s not going to go to read just grades and just get the keys to the piano or the right place on a wooden machine .
because that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the point of letters is that you can only see when you can do the language .
so , you need to use the learning process of the music at least as long as the spoken language .
there &apos;s also a lot of ultraviolet , if you &apos;re learning it for the most profitable , just passive , or you can also talk to the musical speaker , until the musical speaker .
the work of the computer &apos;s work starts similar to the one of the things that you see .
after you first chose to play a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about the way you &apos;re going to be able to get to your own position of the composition of the composition .
you collect information about the piece in the brain industry .
you read in the letters , you read notes , notes , or whether words , thoughts from composers himself .
you study the works that he was before and after .
you think of comparison .
the motives , it &apos;s writing .
how , what does he think ?
how were his condition , how the society and politics ?
all of that is interested in me .
you think in this time , by looking at the case of contemporary images , or literature , you &apos;re reading .
but with the time , you also have a representative knowledge to the composers , the composers you play more than you &apos;re playing , and it &apos;s always easier to feel in it and feel more lightweight .
the composer is always going to be more and more alive with the family .
his cause to write the piece is always becoming more and more to my personal cause , it &apos;s going to play .
now , the notes of the mind , the notes of the message of the composer , is just a framework , and i &apos;m now going to turn this framework to the point , and to make sense of meaning and meaning .
i then say with my own words , which could be written between this framework .
i play the game , which may have these notes to mean .
now for me , and for the composers , and what they could now mean for him today .
every note , every phrase , is getting sense because i feel it , because it comes from my own personal body .
it has to be in here and now being a lot of the news , i can &apos;t convince my audience that my cause is .
it &apos;s always a happy concert , and it &apos;s a very happy concert when i may have the experience that i &apos;ve been working on so long in the way that we &apos;ve been able to experience .
as you &apos;ve been able to have been able to have a happy new day , even though always with the same rituals of life , up , breakfast , to work , so i &apos;ve always always got the same piece over the new .
i &apos;ve become a day older , and i &apos;m going to go down to the seasons , and my pulse goes down at night , in a auditorium , that the sound comes back to the side of the day .
i &apos;m going to take the audience to the audience , consciously , or unconscious .
all of this is influenced by me and all this influenced my experience with composition .
it &apos;s wonderful , as i &apos;m standing on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , more powerful conversation .
you get a new idea in the place , and it &apos;s going to be answered with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting because then things that we haven &apos;t practiced and what you can &apos;t do is not yet .
it makes great fun to make music , and it &apos;s been the audience , and then the audience has been communicating how to live alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more like that in this moment .
i can &apos;t play as much as in 20 years .
i &apos;m going to have more life forms than today , and therefore , i &apos;m going to have a lot more of the time of the computer &apos;s brain , and that &apos;s where i &apos;m going to have a lot more more sophisticated , emotion and emotions than
sure , i &apos;m going to have some of the most cosmopolitan , but for that new money .
so , a nice example of this .
it was on a school clinic for a fellow , in my beloved old teachers , professor , a famous , famous , famous , more powerful , a lot of the health &apos;s health , and a thousand year-old professor here in the street .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so he was already a lot of the time when i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortune , and i was very early to meet , and i was to meet my school classes on my school .
i was 17 when i went back to one of his courses and i played the last one of the four calls of chopin , a computer company .
he asked me what the preamble of this kind of rock was .
this is a part of the kind of business .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m talking , expectation . &quot;
and he &apos;s like , &quot; so , it &apos;s like that ? &quot;
that must be the most powerful .
because it means it memory .
he was over 60 .
well , with 17 , you &apos;ve got dreams , but no major memories .
i &apos;m playing the piece of all the few years , and i &apos;ve always got it out for me , although not the only grade has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , i &apos;m going to read something new .
an example of a whole different area . voodoo , the most successful of the world &apos;s being painted .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but in different day , in the same day , in the light of the light .
he &apos;s translated the most powerful , like , as he saw , like you &apos;re looking at it at this moment .
his personal personal health system .
the main interpretation of a piece is comparable to this .
now , i &apos;m also older than chopin with a horse &apos;s day , when he wrote the piece .
he &apos;s lived only for years .
and it &apos;s important to look at the notes , even though i mean , you can memorize it .
to keep a lot of time , right with the composers .
because the notes are the only link to him .
especially if he died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said , well , you need to do about the spoken language for the spoken language .
so often the most powerful thing is that you learn to read the notes .
you learn to be the first reading before you just talk to one word .
you learn to find the notes on the notes .
and when all the fingers in time and right like it is in the notes , they come up , and then sound sounds like music .
when that happens accurate , the students get the most accurate piece .
it &apos;s not spoken about interpretation .
well , there &apos;s a little bit of the front of the front , that &apos;s a quick piece .
so , slow , slow .
and loud , f , b , etc .
so , most of these guys are .
but also , if you try to push this data , it &apos;s still something more technical .
and it &apos;s always not an interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something very much about .
because , to make music on the instrument , that &apos;s going to be your musical musical system , and you &apos;re going to feel there before .
that &apos;s the singing .
a child that didn &apos;t learn to sing because it doesn &apos;t have the parents to do it , it doesn &apos;t do it .
this is like the most cosmopolitan .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experience and the idea of music to have a more possibility , so about a tool , to sound .
people who never sing singing , so they never felt immediately with their own body , as it is to make a sound .
a phrase with his own breath .
because the brain project is the extension of our body .
our vocal vocal team to sing , our hands and feet .
so the internet is the sequel in the piano of my fingers .
the tune comes from the animal &apos;s atmosphere and the rhythm of the dance .
the more progressive environmental technology today is not great .
you don &apos;t need to make music even if it &apos;s a boring .
not need to be needed , a more powerful one , or singing .
every single person &apos;s own , if you &apos;re constantly blowing out of the outside with music .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t sing ?
the question i can &apos;t sing , you can &apos;t sing , a , because you think you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they don &apos;t have learned to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to start to figure out whether they can &apos;t yet learn whether they can &apos;t do this little muscles that are hiring the vocal chords , right .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re training .
or c , because you have it , you &apos;re going to be able to be more restrained .
so , i wonder how much of the time was these diagnosis ?
have you got a more serious or a car company , like you &apos;re beautiful now ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and you don &apos;t want to have any music to do with that .
but what i would have is regret , because music is a beautiful , more appropriate thing .
but maybe you can also even be more restrained .
well , you see , all cases have to be a single candidate candidate .
but don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand anything from classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i mean , but sure you can say , you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says somebody , i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s taste , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , you don &apos;t get rid of food , just because you can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to get rid of classical music , because you don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen consciously and say if it tastes to you or not .
whether the music is to be too sweet or too sweet .
tell that what you &apos;re feeling .
and the time you get to the time , and you want to get some more spices , or taste even fine differences .
why am i asking from my audience that it &apos;s also actively listening ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate there .
a piece of artwork that you never look at , has no force to do .
the food , which was taken from a chef or a chef , was being cooked , and not only looked at recipes or recipes .
so please listen , if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice thing .
if in a environment , where the adults are actively taking music or at least , music is growing up , a child is growing , and it &apos;s very easy to ask , to ask , what color has your flower ?
can you now play me in blue ?
and the child plays , after a computer , rather than a red flower , a red flower .
and this sounds very different than before .
and that was the first beginning of a long musical expression .
so the first step to an interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today , which was originally a hundred , two times ago , or before three hundred years ago ?
now , the instruments have moved .
there was no piano at the time , as a tool , even a device .
it wasn &apos;t invented yet .
i think the stream would have been thrilled if he had had the smartest possibilities of modern health care .
i can now the most recent , which has had the stream , to the modern wing to sound , which is a little bit of a plastic that can &apos;t be a viable ball .
and by beethoven , you know that he had more than he had been deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that has been rejected by the time as a function of the time .
so the composers rely on us , which is reinventing the pieces again .
they climb up , which they &apos;ve been identified in the spirit of the spirit .
and also what you would think about today in the spirit .
or what i &apos;m going to do today , because what you might have thought about .
thank you .
you know what envy is ?
were they all the glory ?
and how did that feel ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a laser .
and then when i come , my little v w , and i &apos;m wrong , and i &apos;m going to get this feeling .
i &apos;m going through a head .
i say , &quot; what do you need to do , &quot; is it great car ?
so that &apos;s the first year for half his value .
and at all , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to afford so much of the n ?
and then i immediately falls to a moment that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say , justice is this awkward feeling .
our organism invented a great way to get such crazy feelings like envy just to disappear .
you can try and do that with words like revenge or a little bit of the web .
i want to explain with you something , or something to be suspicious , what you &apos;re probably familiar with .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but think about the lie , as you may have heard , if people say nobody has to build the intention .
and then rocks , so it &apos;s cutting them off the way .
so on a lie , you see that the liars don &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to test the fact that it has very different in mind .
he &apos;s just it &apos;s just it , and not itself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about is doing it , that they themselves deceive themselves .
they need this lie to get a laser , to get a self-deception .
you can get less easily , yes , you get a little bit more , or you can get a cost of collapse .
they need time .
and this is a gentleman that talks about , maybe you know .
the spanish painter picasso once has a woman .
and then this woman was complaining about it , she wouldn &apos;t see her very way .
picasso says , wait for just wait .
it &apos;s always going to be more similar .
and at this point , when you laugh , you realize how important this lie is , and how much time you need to learn what artists are doing very well .
because artists have a rigorous relationship to lie .
the artist gives you something , and especially this lady , which she doesn &apos;t see when she just looks in the mirror .
the artist gives you something in such a portrait with something that you &apos;re going to be familiar with when you &apos;re looking at this piece of artwork .
then this awkward feeling , it could not be seen , you know , it &apos;s not going to see you , and it &apos;s always going to be more similar .
here you have this mechanism that we can use as a great invention to the patent of our own health system .
and not only in art , also in the most responsible , in the mythology , in stories , it &apos;s coming back .
you may know this idea of the lady that looked at every morning in the mirror and asked him who &apos;s the most beautiful in all the country ?
one day , this mirror , yes , is there &apos;s a little bit of a computer .
behind seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this true adapted , also the mirror can &apos;t lie , from that true set of views .
but we should just be familiar with that that you can &apos;t tell a woman , that there &apos;s a little bit different in a place .
here it is necessary , which we &apos;re going to understand under the steel community , again .
we need this lie that we have to take the deception without the other we can &apos;t live .
we don &apos;t just have the art in the world , in the world &apos;s office , but also in science as great lies .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s history of the orchestra of the horse .
she heard about this book by charles darwin , the origin of species , the way of the people .
that the human being to evolve and , yes , there would be a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then they ran them to her husband and said , &quot; well , that &apos;s not true , what charles writes . &quot;
the human being to have evolved or have a shared ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not going .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to prevent that people are going to know about it .
why do we need to prevent people from something to be able to get to mind ?
because we cannot live without those online problems .
because we , this self-deception , that sense , to be great , from the highest creatures , not from one such as a result of a kind of organism , from such a kind of organism , as a organism , which is still as much as a bug
so , we can &apos;t do these things .
we need to prevent people to know that people are going to know about things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you see how slowly this mechanism is coming out and how the traces look , which he leaves , which is going to lead to something else than this great image of ourselves , i want to give you another story .
a particularly nice story , like i mean .
my wife told me it .
she came from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told her about a student .
a student student .
it likes to be particularly like , because he has a propensity to adapt to the bamboo .
and she asked him what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire department .
and because i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in the world &apos;s business .
yes , you feel it when you &apos;re out of this place . there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , whenever a human being in a moral fit is the most important thing , because we should try and replace it through the design of the world .
and you &apos;ll see that and then you experience the sentence .
although i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in the world &apos;s business .
they feel that this is the actual truth behind the tracks .
so a little bit of a little bit of a computer that &apos;s interested in the ground .
that &apos;s what &apos;s interested in the design of the world .
but there &apos;s no concerts , which we can look for , where you learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second second , just the fire fire .
he was signed up .
and the reason you &apos;re not saying that you can &apos;t say that you &apos;d like to put fires somewhere and you &apos;re happy to be a breath after the fire after the next day .
no , it looks much better , if we show that we &apos;re in charge of that , that we &apos;re going to get to the dangers of the other , the other one that &apos;s only going to make fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this one that &apos;s the case that the very estate is already known that he &apos;s actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that .
here you have this kind of thing between the unconscious and the conscious , which immediately jump up , without that you can do something about it , and the things that you know that you can see very different for you and other people .
so , just as these words are going to happen , we &apos;re going to use the words that we &apos;re using in the language of politically correct partnerships .
we know that something else is the case .
but we know when we call that , the social narrative is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to do things like this in a society that should work .
i want to share with you now what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
after which logic that makes this deception , this self-deception , the willingness , a different reality than the one we actually know in the unconscious knowledge is that they &apos;re valid after the outside .
so , i want to show you two , maybe three examples of this .
the first example is ahead of what many of you know and some of you appreciate , just not necessarily need a few of them .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is something like this , about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that doesn &apos;t stop stop from stop , physical nature .
and if you have people who are the more useful , they have a soul , or you can also say that they &apos;ve been brought in from the soul to live , then they think that they have been able to be the kind of intellectual framework , and
and from that soul , you now think that somehow they kind of in this kind of these cloudy these seals , in this sort of engineering nature , is called the latin , the most in the latin , the middle of the world , the most , present
and then if this sort of thing that happens to people , then he &apos;s filled with dignity with dignity , with spirit , with nature , that can only live , yes with soul .
and then he can just get a handle .
this is the idea that the soul is working .
so it &apos;s going to be coming from the outside to people .
so we should be able to perceive what &apos;s going to be that we should be a bit of present to our lives .
and if you have this assumption , you understand the logic that we experience this happiness , through a lie of our world .
because now you can use a laser system .
you know , you know , you &apos;re from school .
this is a computer that describes a logic that describes a logic .
this is the hardest part of the world &apos;s hardest part .
here you need something that is real , but also the willingness to lie .
so to lie that you can just apply this logic to the wrong .
in this case , three sentences come up .
the first sentence is , the first one says , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if you have a right , it &apos;s not a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i was particularly struck by him .
third sentence , which immediately shows you that people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul , that &apos;s dead and can &apos;t say anything .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s the logic that comes in this , yes , in this particular talk , to expression .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , the logical things .
because i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any explanation about reality .
i can say the most powerful is a man .
and if i have right , the most popular man is a man .
if i don &apos;t have right , the most popular thing is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but the key is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s true .
so if you say , &quot; there &apos;s no soul . &quot;
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical .
and now our consciousness is immediately true , and it can be done something .
it &apos;s a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s what does the opposite of the first sentence already proven and more influential .
because we have to prove that there &apos;s no matter whether there &apos;s no soul or not .
but with this logic that just uses it , two sentences are logical , and a third of the reason that it looks like he could have something to do with it , we can save our food systems .
so , we &apos;re doing it as if it was actually impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things at different examples .
in the present , we have a whole modern example of the present , and again , the most pervasive line .
and you have to think about another philosophical topic , a more powerful thing , and you think of it as a philosophy .
so that &apos;s what we do to do that in the world &apos;s climate .
there was a scholars who was called johannes , and after that , the most prolific defeated .
the causal receiver is a holistic , which is a holistic nature of pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
this is a kind of a rock system .
and if you put the exact exact exact exact thing in the middle between two , it &apos;s a lot of the time .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a haystack he should do first .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
so , the most popular thing is that the main group was introduced .
and the other thing that &apos;s going to solve is the other thing that &apos;s going on .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
and if you take another example , if you make a haystack bigger , it doesn &apos;t need a sense of reason , and it doesn &apos;t even need a reason .
automatically , he goes to the right thoughts .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re somehow driven in nature , it &apos;s going to be driven by the larger pile that you put on , and then you have the feeling that there &apos;s a little bit of a free will to give you .
and if we &apos;re in the field of ice , i remember the most complex of brain science .
there &apos;s a scholars that says wolf &apos;s &quot; and it &apos;s like , &quot; sometimes , wolf , &quot; there &apos;s no free free .
now we can go back to the second sentence , and we can say , if wolf &apos;s rights is right , he has no free free free .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we &apos;re going to read almost every day in the daily journal , find them in this third sentence .
and it &apos;s about who doesn &apos;t have any free free , and it can &apos;t be pulled for his actions and claims to responsibility and he &apos;s so troubled .
and here you have it again .
you know , you have to prove that you have something like free .
but the logic of deception allows us to do so as if the first sentence of the first first came wrong , you would have to take the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just do something if you want to do anything , if you want to test anything and you &apos;re really interested in the case of making people happy , and that courage to lie to lie .
so , practice that , if you can imagine a human being , you can say , there &apos;s no more reflective .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for the ted company , which means prophet .
you can &apos;t call it , that would be a little political , and it &apos;s a little political .
say , there &apos;s no food system .
immediately you &apos;ll be able to get one for the one that &apos;s like this , you know , that you can &apos;t prove .
and you have a problem .
because while they &apos;re busy , they &apos;re not able to prove that they can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no way to prove that there is no food .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s fooled .
because he &apos;s led them to a ton of a red , on the ground that he didn &apos;t even get away .
because actually , this man isn &apos;t interested in evidence .
it &apos;s just interested in the way that you have to prove to yourself that there &apos;s a need to prove that there &apos;s a lot of time .
so , in the way the evidence of the evidence , you see the brilliance of lying .
and once you have a way of feeling this kind of thing , to feel these kinds of things , you do it , because you &apos;re going to make other happy if you don &apos;t remember them in the way that you &apos;re in the way .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve been allowed to ask myself , i could say , &quot; i &apos;ll mention it . &quot;
it &apos;s one of the most powerful here , and it &apos;s been asked me if i wanted to give a talk here and my idea of the idea of the audience .
i have to be honest , you &apos;ve got it , i think , very hard to talk about my idea .
and i may think maybe my favorite thing is i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
but it &apos;s of course the sum of the whole , many ideas .
i &apos;m probably , you know , the two nice girls still , i &apos;m probably in the generation of the generation that has been made for this bad kind of view , because i &apos;ve been starting to study engineering in the field of engineering , technical college ,
and i was going to put it in the mid- &apos; 80s , because i wanted to make renewable energy and i didn &apos;t have that in the most responsible .
there was the most popular news .
the rabbis were all the most cosmopolitan , the most cosmopolitan .
the hot today is called the internet .
because a good engineer has either been built , or a good engineer .
but this is what the n &apos;s like , from the way that you get a hundred watts from the square meter , that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy sign of rock .
i &apos;m grateful to the fact that he &apos;s got the word again , because after the ted prize , you didn &apos;t have to use the word , because it was all bad , because it was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that much in the u.s.
there was this thing that there was a lot of time , and one of them was sitting in the most responsible , in the most responsible , where you thought that it was evil .
and the point of the ice system , but it was called the air , and it was made wind and energy and the energy and i started in the mid- 1980s .
and yes , a lot of what was said today , i &apos;m very , very , very , very beautiful expressions of that , which i &apos;ve been living through .
i &apos;ve been working in the collective working , which was the most painful .
we were 20 people .
if one didn &apos;t say , the most successful thing was , that &apos;s a completely valid thing , and i &apos;ve been very hard to do it , if i was a great deal of my great career , i &apos;ve got a really hard deal of whether i
it &apos;s busy with insanity .
and that was really , very , very , very , very , very , in the way in which you come in , and it &apos;s a picture on a screen , where i asked myself to have a thousand years of time , a thousand years of time
and i then have it to be a little bit of the design of the design , and then we have become a sediment of the company that then was then a big , the most powerful thing to be in the world &apos;s atmosphere , which was the most
and then , of course , a very , but also , we have the problem of a growing company and we have a little bit of a set of a group , and we have a small group , and we decided that we &apos;re going to start little
and i brought you a project that i want to introduce you to now .
and the title of the talk was , yes , like to get to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started to start with a relatively lightweight story , where you could do a memory , because you can make a memory today .
on this island , this is the island of the island of the ocean .
yes , these are the data .
there are four thousand people .
now , this is a renewable trade of 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
it &apos;s just technological not .
if you wind more wind together , the system starts failing .
i also tell the politicians when they &apos;re in the business of the building , and they &apos;re in the world .
and then , you know , why ?
we &apos;ve already got 20 percent in germany .
but can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have seven percent , and our network is physically seen the european world .
if we had in europe 20 percent , we &apos;ve had the same problems that people on this island have .
the question was simple , and it was a little bit of the first of the minds , and the first contacts started with the island , but just by the time .
how big would it be that a battery would be so much so a battery to go to 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent of renewable causes .
and yes , i &apos;ll go again again .
the conventional system is all around the world .
by the way , a year of a hundred gigawatts is going to be completely packed in the world .
that &apos;s the power of a hundred nuclear power , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the world &apos;s favorite world , the world &apos;s natural , is that it &apos;s going to be deleted with unnecessary , because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s going fast .
you &apos;re going to be in a box .
and then it looks like this .
in the run , three of the most popular , two will always wait .
yeah , so it &apos;s a little bit down there .
we also have very precise data .
and the main system or the solar system or whatever it is , is a system that is more likely to be a system , which is just a system that can only be in small quantities here .
and our goal was just to say , okay .
the ozone is going to be a lot of the wind and the wind , the sun is the burden of the load .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , the power of the day , not the performance right now , you have to turn the ozone off .
that means that the moment you have to worry about renewables is that the entire net can take over the entire net .
and of course , you can only get done in some way in this way , and you can get it here .
that &apos;s no one on the world .
so , this is in the small style , so you can also use your car &apos;s car on a little bit of a car .
people always ask me what was going on in the world , because actually , in the blink of it ?
that &apos;s what it &apos;s going on .
but if you want to have multiple of these online types , and you should build a net , it will be extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to come to 70 to ninety percent renewable and then still stay here , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , renewable , renewable , renewable , that will be very , very expensive , that it will be made of batteries
it &apos;s going to be a energy supply that then , you know , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , or the sh , it will be .
you have to go to a more smart and you &apos;re not just picking up the air and not just touch .
we just wanted to know what is a normal , more energetic electrochemical battery .
how far is it that you &apos;re at all ?
and then they &apos;ve made a whole bunch of simulations .
and have wind and sun and the burden of water and came to the conclusion , a very exciting result that you need to be a very interesting thing to be about the conventional system , about 50 cents a micron , about 50 cents coming up with a micron
these were the first calculations of six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
well , you know , we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper as the most powerful , if the average of five percent per year goes up .
and then we started to negotiate with the design chain .
what would all of you have to do ?
have investors negotiate , i &apos;ve looked for new school problems .
we were only five people at the time to build a society again .
and here &apos;s the representation .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green system is our system .
that our system also has a more powerful , because we &apos;re still doing 20 percent with unlimited , and also a more powerful thing to the other things .
and the most popular , the most common thing that the most popular thing is , is that we find it very great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , which we can sort of do the electric narrative of the island in the scale of the island .
that means we &apos;ve been looking for the first battery to find the largest battery in the world .
here she is .
it &apos;s naturally coming from asia , in the case of japan .
and the other thing is , in the 1970s , it &apos;s in the bbc &apos; 70s , and today , i &apos;ve been developing , and then it became the japanese , and then the japanese was going to be the japanese .
it &apos;s you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has a megawatts of performance and can get six hours long to get this performance and that &apos;s the battery we &apos;re sort of projecting out .
and then they set up .
we also have one of these most powerful things in the same size , as he &apos;s standing there in the hall to actually be the complete dynamic behavior of this web , so in the hall , it &apos;s now the great battery , there &apos;s the big battery
over here we simulate the whole network of the cable , the cable , the cable of the cable , to represent the kind of the net in the net .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we can also get a couple of moments of kilowatts of recaptcha on the web .
here we see this again again , again , the ozone , here , again , the whole , single , single user .
and what we &apos;ve done since we did was , since the time , the hall was finished , until today , all of the things that are going on between the individual system is to develop in the software , we did .
so we &apos;re not a more pessimistic , but we define ourselves as a company that is only between the subject of battery and the subject of the web .
you have to communicate to the battery , you have to communicate , you also have to communicate in the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is the point that you &apos;re basically in this island , which is basically the most important thing that we &apos;re going to get , if we want to increase our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion , how will it go back and forth , and the way that we go , and we have a lot of time to go to the island for example , for example , for instance , for instance , we &apos;re going to take the
and then , the other thing is , it &apos;s a lot of the time .
so , a computer system , a computer system everywhere .
we can start to integrate the island of this , to start to integrate , to design , you can manage the burden .
that means that when you &apos;re at 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do it without memory .
you can do it by &quot; n &quot; , you can go through the nets , yes , you should do it in any case , but you can never get rid of memory , but you can never get rid of memory .
and that &apos;s the &quot; n little &quot; message .
so , many people and look at this , and they look at this , because you can see what the problems are you get .
if we turn off the ozone , you don &apos;t have any more that that &apos;s causing a bit more inertia in the net .
and our favorite team of energy is basically just rotating out of a lot of power , which is where the wave is all around europe .
we look at this web in the web , see 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s going to be nine hertz , we start a few more migratory practices , then a little bit of a little bit of a steam , then we come back to a little
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredibly important .
if you &apos;re going to go somewhere , it &apos;s a while .
the state reserves has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in the time you can react again .
if you don &apos;t have that , this spinning mass , you have to replace it with the kind of metal and you have to replace it with the water .
and we can once be with this big battery , two milliseconds .
and then you can see what enormous amounts of energy there are .
and the message is , we need to get rid of these rotating masses when we kind of have our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 , 30 percent and so on when we want to reach the ones at all .
then we have to break our capacity into the net .
so , the power station is simply going on with the power station to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a second of the moment , the most popular , because we don &apos;t , or we don &apos;t know , or not , because it &apos;s not going to be .
and we &apos;re just trying to make a decision that you can make the capacity , the capacity to break out the capacity , and it can break into the grid , and you can also get electrochemical memory in the net .
now , fortunately , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies .
and then , to that purpose , people always come and look at our online systems , basically our main team .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you get there a little bit more , a little bit more than you can get there .
and many discussions that i had in the last six years , similar to the discussion i had in the last 30 years , the following the theme of the day .
it &apos;s not , is pointless , and we have all of them , we have all of them , never .
we have 30 gigawatts of sunshine in germany .
this is a little bit of a game .
and i just go out of the next 30 years , that we have the same capacity to have the same capacity to minimize hypothermia throughout the world .
just , it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s a lot of information that will be there , and arguments .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve been in the last two years , that scientists are going to meet my side .
we &apos;ve got about 10 million of the time now , and we have to get to the german net now .
this is going to happen next april .
so , from that , you also realize that there is a change there , and only from that persistent way to the idea , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable right now .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a kind of a system of renewable system .
and in discussions , in discussions , this is always trying to do this , which is the way that we have a little bit of a small web that has a little bit of a small web that has nothing to do with our brain .
but the question is , just simply , if you make completely independent from any fossil or a half of the fossil or a half of the world , you &apos;re going to be able to get a island , and you &apos;re going to be able to get a
then they &apos;re only using what the sun and wind is there , where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a nuclear energy supply and i &apos;m cradle to be grateful that they used to use solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and that &apos;s where we come , also , the talk of the ted system , that you can be a collective and use solar energy , and there &apos;s a little bit together .
and yeah , i just want to encourage you to just encourage you to be a little bit crazy , and you can have a vision .
and you really have to stay quite tough , but i think it &apos;s going .
thank you .
as steve lopez , the time of los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a african-american , rough , rough , homeless , homeless a violin , which had only two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from the article that was been launched , a book that was once a book , which was a book that was a gentleman named steve lopez , and jamie douglas , who was at the most extraordinary time , and
nathaniel left juilliard , suffered a breakdown and 30 years later , he lived as homeless on the streets of the street row in los angeles .
i recommend reading all of the time , and i &apos;m proposing to read the movie , so you can &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that came between these two men , but also how the music helped the connection , and then , as it comes , it
i met mr. &apos;s last year in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney hall .
he just heard a demo of beethoven first and fourth symphony and came behind the stage to imagine me .
he spoke in a very troubled and a very troubled clay about yo-yo hussein and hillary clinton and the dodgers &apos; dodgers never would create the baseball series of the world series , and that &apos;s all because of the world &apos;s favorite passage of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
we came to speak of music . and a few days later , i got a email , in which nathaniel was interested in the school of mine .
i have to say that nathaniel had a medical treatment , because he was already with electric and with a mixed and fooled and instinctively , a trauma that has been tracking his entire life .
as a result , it &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic stages , and these are sometimes so bad , and he &apos;s gone away for days , and it &apos;s going to be covered by the streets of the head row , always that horror and the most responsible
and in the same way , nathaniel was in the same way when we started with our first class in the walt disney hall , and he had this insane piano in his eyes , and he was completely lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and how someone wanted to poison in sleep .
i was afraid , not a lot of time , but i was afraid that i could lose it , that he could sink in a state of his states and then destroy him his relationship to the violin if i started talking about the scales and other exciting forms
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s film .
and while i was playing , i fell on the face of a total change in the face of a total change .
it was like he was under the impact of an invisible drug , a chemical response , which is a catalyst to my game .
the most thoughtful anger of anger turned into understanding , in a calm curiosity and grace .
and as through a miracle he took his violin and started to play a few clips of the steel , and then asked me to play her , and then to play it , the other thing , the more important , the training , the , white , lemon
we started talking about music , starting by bach , covered by beethoven , johannes , and all the other people , from the other , from the street to the street .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just have a real knowledge of music , but also connected to her own personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i &apos;d ever ever known from my colleagues in the sports of los angeles .
by playing music and talked about music , it was confused by this kind of lake , confused man who had been pulled out of the streets of los angeles , a computer , a great , fine , in juilliard musicians .
music is medicine . music is changing .
for nathaniel , music is a perfect emotional health .
because the music allows him to , his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and , in some real sense , to be real social .
and so he &apos;s going to be a poetic condition .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
this is why we do music : so we do something that is inside us in all of us , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity , through our creativity , to actually form .
and the reality of this expression is all of us , and we &apos;re going to move , inspired and united .
what nathaniel set up , so he brought back to a community of friends .
the power force of music brought him back into a family of musicians who realized his talent and the world-class revolution .
and i &apos;m always going to go back with nathaniel music , whether in the walt disney hall , or in the retail row , because he reminds me why i was a musician .
thank you .
bruno &apos;s s : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta : robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i stole the most selective .
i hope you forgive me .
so i &apos;ve known many fish in my life .
i just loved two loved .
this first one , that was more like a passionate kind of a passionate .
it was a beautiful fish , a good texture , good texture , a report on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was being raised in the most contemporary of the highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel that you could be selling it .
i had a relationship with this beauty of several months .
one day , the head of the company called , and he asked if i could be in a chair of the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what was going to be the unimaginable problem for our donors , how do we keep fish on our camps ?
in the last 50 years , we have fish fish as we beat the ocean .
it &apos;s hard to do the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the most powerful , the most pessimistic , they &apos;re crawling , they collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , perhaps , or bad , it &apos;s going to be a part of our future .
many arguments about it . the environment , the environment , most of you , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a family of 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of oil are necessary to get a pound of a pound .
not very sustainable .
don &apos;t taste very well .
so here was a company that was trying to do it right .
i wanted to help them .
the day before the event , i called the pr director for the company .
let &apos;s call him please .
&quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous to grow so far out in the sea that you don &apos;t get a dent . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . we &apos;re so far out that the waste of our fish will be distributed , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this is the one that &apos;s a story of two , and he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
two to one , great .
&quot; marry one thing ? what does your death feeds ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put .
and at this evening , i was in bed and thought , what on hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i was going to come up with the next day , shortly before the event , don &apos;t .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;ll show you .
well , i &apos;m going to put a couple of people in the company , and nobody could give me a proper answer to me until i finally finally with the senior biologists .
let &apos;s call him please please .
&quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; what for example are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some of the most delicious , and then he said , &quot; he &apos;s going to go . &quot;
i said , &quot; do you get a lot of time ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , mass jams , brick , dry and alcohol . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your body body is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , these are about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what is sustainable about eating chicken ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i &apos;m going to get from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a nuclear scientist and i &apos;m a rubber student .
that &apos;s me .
no , i actually have a little bit of a plastic company , because , i swear to god , who was able to have fish after this conversation after chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of play .
it &apos;s the romantic way that you know , the better you know your fish , you &apos;re the more , the fish love .
i &apos;ve been eating him in a restaurant in a restaurant .
a little bit of a journalist had spoken for a long time since this fish .
it &apos;s got us in a certain way .
he came up with a bright , almost white white paint .
the chef had him .
wait twice .
and amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish so well after it became a plastic problem ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s clone it . it &apos;s actually a layered thing .
and no , he didn &apos;t eat the fish and he &apos;s not a chef . at least the way you understand and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at the la la la .
this is a key corner in the middle corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s was the farm in the hands of the boat .
they raised the most highly skilled , which is basically wetlands .
they did that by putting the country out of the country .
they built these complicated episode of channels , and they held water out of the country and out of the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make it that they didn &apos;t work economically .
and it was a disaster .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds to be a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , in 1982 , the country bought green the land .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of water vice versa .
they literally pushed the lever .
instead of using the water , they used the channels to get the water back .
they &apos;re going to be the canals .
they created a 11,000 acres of cotton -- the , the shrimp , shrimp , shrimp , and the company , and the environmental destruction , the ecological destruction completely melts .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they stare at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you &apos;re seeing are the canals and the dense , lush march .
i was not a long time at all with a dec .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three pieces of charles darwin and a part of &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? there were we and fought through the wetlands and i put on the wetlands and i have a fan of mud , and i have mud to my knees , and tear up in quiet .
it lifts a rare diagnostic system .
now , he mentioned the most prolific of capillaries .
and here , here he looks a pattern of simulated projection that reminds him to the most cosmopolitan giraffe .
it turns out that cloning is the largest part of its career in the national park in africa .
i asked him how to become a kind of a computer accident .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and falls over rare birds and algae and weird , strange .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the most amazing community , in the way that you &apos;re in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak about this kind of crazy piece of delicious fish that i had on the most marginalized .
so i cut him . i said , &quot; yuck , how does it feel that your fish tastes so good ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know young , the algae , the curtain , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what are your fish eating ?
how is the most popular ? &quot;
now , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a wonderful system that the fish eat , which would eat it in the wild .
the food epidemic , the spinneret biomass , the zoo , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely valid .
there &apos;s no food .
the one farm from a farm is not feeding their animals ?
later , i went to this site with a dec , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems like being so different , &quot; in the way that you &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
in the moment , when a director would have a computer director .
and we took the line to the corner and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pinker , a literally an profile that &apos;s enough to make the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your own , pink .
they &apos;re going to be a lot of the time . &quot;
so , i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; yuck , you don &apos;t have your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and we &apos;re going to be able to get the birds .
well last year , 600,000 birds were on this site , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s now the largest and one of the most important private private communities in europe .
i said , &quot; dec , is it a good thing to do , not the last thing you &apos;d like to have on a high-speed factory ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building a lot of the work , not intense .
this is a commercial network .
the shrimp is eating the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the spinneret scanners .
so the official the gut , the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . one farm that doesn &apos;t escape their animals and a farm that measures their success to their predators .
a computer company , but also a computer system .
oh , and by the way , this is not even going to be there .
they breed in a city of 240 miles , where the most common news is better for the oil industry .
every morning they fly 240 miles to farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles .
they do that because they can follow the white white line of the highway .
seriously .
i had introduced a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at it .
i said , &quot; miguel , fly 240 miles to the farm and then fly 240 miles back at night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me when i was quoted just a song of whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . they do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like a throwaway . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this kind of carbon , the taste of flavor .
i &apos;m almost never cooking for cooking .
and yet , when i tried to put them in this restaurant , they didn &apos;t actually stimulate it for the first time .
she liked sweet and she would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned the way it &apos;s dec and he &apos;s screaming .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense of the body before something in the body .
it &apos;s developed over the evolution of evolution to mimic the bird . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no more . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t escape their fish . a farm that measures their success is the success of their predators .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that has no clan , he &apos;s got huge , because the water that comes through this farm is from the river in the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things to be the rivers that are now being made , and they &apos;re going to lead to chemical pollutants , flow of carbon pollutants .
and if it &apos;s fought through the system , and this is the water that &apos;s clean , as it is .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not only one farm , which doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that measures their success of their predators , but a farm that literally is a single kind of a plastic , and not just for those fish but also me .
because when the water is blowing it up , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and you should do it , because this love of love , as romantic as it is , is also writing .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future good food , whether we &apos;re talking about the world &apos;s future or a drug problem .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in fact , really taste .
but for many people , this is a little bit radical .
we &apos;re not a lot of a street , we &apos;re a lover . we &apos;re a lover .
we love farmers . we love small pieces of food . we talk about local food . we eat organic .
and if you say that the things that are the future is somebody who &apos;s good to tell the future , and says , &quot; hey people , i love the ted community , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;ve already produced enough calories to feed the world more than only to feed .
one billion people are going to be hungry today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because the interference effects in the distribution , not the greenhouse gas emissions .
well , i don &apos;t like this question , because they &apos;re the logic of our own , the last 50 years .
feed crops , the herbivores , on the ground , chemicals on the earth , chicken on fish , chicken , and the whole time has simply asked the agribusiness : &quot; if we feed more people , how awful can that be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the easy thing . it was the business business of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a craft in the coal industry , a forest that &apos;s fast to the heart of environmental capital , which allows that to make this production .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our favorite is threatened today , not due to the internet , but because of the resources , it &apos;s not due to the resources .
not by the latest , and not the latest land , but by fertile land , not through pumps , not through a pumps , not by by by by by , but by the oceanic water , not by by the time , but through the forests of the
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that have contributed every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in the process of being produced , and it never produces a really good job to eat .
let &apos;s instead instead of looking at the ecological model .
this is the one that &apos;s in two billion years of expertise .
look at it , a layered , farmers like clogged .
businesses that are not worlds for themselves , businesses , rather than a drug company , are growing , businesses , the most powerful , farmers , who are not only selling them , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , they &apos;re experts for relationships ,
because they are the ones who are experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;m ever going to be .
you know , this is right , because if the future is good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to illustrate one thing today , it &apos;s that the whole data we consume is larger than the sum of your parts and instead of thinking about the way i think that you can use information as well as we can use information , that patterns would
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical design project of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called the &quot; unclear &quot; and what i can do with a little bit of death , that i can filter for a certain cause of death .
and i &apos;ll see a different pattern that makes it happen .
and that &apos;s because in the most recent , people are most active , and they &apos;re over here at the most advanced time .
we can move a step further and then divide the data and see the data that &apos;s the usual suspects , but not for anyone .
now , when we move forward and gradually , we &apos;re going to see 40 years or younger , we &apos;re going to see accidents that are even concerned about people .
and who &apos;s looking at this is particularly true with men .
so you see , the problem of information and data in this way is very much remembered in a living form of life .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not even do you think of content itself ?
now what we have here is the world sport &apos;s book , and the sport ever had been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it for my talk in your rooms .
with a decade of light , you can dive into a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this copy and the sports .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i click here here , and i &apos;ll show you all of the time that lance armstrong is mentioned .
now , if i want to get a little bit of a handle , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the subject ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to go back and get the perspective .
now i see greg mandelbrot &apos;s .
and so you get a idea of that if you &apos;ve been able to figure out information , more serious , wider , zoom , you don &apos;t just zoom in or interrupt , you don &apos;t just shave .
you make something that is actually a little different .
it &apos;s something between and we think it &apos;s going to change the way information can be used .
so i want to do this idea a little bit more than something that &apos;s a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single one of the dna points and reduced it on a little summary .
the summary contains a short spot , and a symbol of the area that comes from it .
i just just show the top 500 of the top of the top of the top .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are on wikipedia at the top of the world .
i &apos;m going to choose the issue of government .
now , after i &apos;ve chosen to know the government , i know that the most popular , the most important time , is &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important , because this is an insight that doesn &apos;t have in a single single single scale .
that &apos;s just to see if you go back and look at the whole .
and then , in a certain of these summaries , i can go into the subject magazine magazine , &quot; people in the year , &quot; and all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are the most important ones . some of the things that are coming from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize .
so we &apos;re going to jump and look at all the ted prize , and we &apos;ll take a look at all of the ted prize .
you see , we &apos;re looking at the web , the first time it &apos;s really , not just to side the side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
i just show you the new york times website .
so , the use of this , i don &apos;t want to give you a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites -- and we can take these pieces of data to everybody , and we &apos;re bringing these together to every
so i can go back to a step , and right to a specific unit of separation .
so this is important because you just look at the websites in the web , and that can look at all the same kinds of things that are happening in the same way .
so i can zoom in in my course in a particular period of time .
here &apos;s the story that i &apos;ve been holding around here .
and i can actually see everything i &apos;ve seen today , again .
and , when i take a step back and look at everything , i can be able to organize my course , maybe , for example , for me , for example , for the &quot; unclear , &quot; looking for the &quot; s lab , &quot; and here &apos;s
and from here i can go into the side and call them back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used again , and every time it &apos;s going to get bigger than the sum of the oil of the fish .
now , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the iraqi world .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head , so that we &apos;re always going to go from one to another , starting from many things to many things , and so many things that would be otherwise hidden ?
if we can do this , then these last few times , this past energy system will make a new source of information .
and , instead of just moving in information , we can get knowledge of it .
and if we know , we can even pull wisdom from that .
so i &apos;m listening to that , thank you .
i grew up with a major portion of science fiction .
i went to school with the bus , every day a hour , every day .
and my nose always put in a book , a book of mine , which my thoughts in other worlds were breaking and in the way my mind was in the other worlds , and i &apos;m actually chasing my deep , powerless curiosity .
this curiosity showed up that i always , when i wasn &apos;t in school , through the forests of the forests , went through the forests , and they were , &quot; specimens , &quot; frogs and horses and the bugs , and looked at everything from the microscope .
i was totally troubled , you know .
it always went to try to understand the world and the limits of the possible explore .
and my love to science fiction seemed to be able to reflect in my environment because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and studied the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came in our room with his fascinating shows that we showed the animals and places and places of miracles that we could never have imagined .
and then this is probably very good at the same time that we have .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there &apos;s neither video video that &apos;s still video video videos , and there &apos;s a imagery that had a imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we had to do that at the time . if we read a book , we took the description of the author , and we put them on the screen in our heads .
my response to this was drawing and paint from aliens , aliens worlds , robots , and all kinds of things .
in math math , i was constantly caught by teachers , as i was hidden in , in the middle of the textbook .
creativity had to be out .
and what happened was something interesting about jacques ornish , which was the idea of a completely unknown world , which was a complete unknown world here .
i certainly would never have a alien world with a spaceship , which seemed quite unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i actually could come to the earth , and she was equally fascinating and exotic as all that i had imagined , when i read these books .
so i decided to become 15 , diver .
the only problem with this was that i lived in a small village in canada , a mile removed from the next ocean .
i didn &apos;t get upset with it .
i &apos;m going to put my father up until finally , a computer professor in buffalo , new york , i realized , just on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my favorite in a pool of the winter in the middle of the winter in the winter in the winter of the winter in buffalo .
but the ocean , but a real ocean , i only got two years later to face the other day when we moved to california .
since 40 years , the last year , i &apos;ve spent about 10,000 hours under water , and 500 hours of it in submersibles .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the ocean , is so rich in the world , as rich as we can &apos;t really imagine .
the nature of nature doesn &apos;t know the limits , very much in contrast to our own , more noisy human imagination .
until today , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love for the ocean is holding , with the same intensity as ever as ever .
when i was a training , it was the easter pole .
that seemed to be the best way to tell my inner mind , to tell stories , to try to unite , to unite , to unite .
i was always drawing comic books and so on .
so , films were the way of bringing pictures and images , and that fit together .
of course , the stories i was looking at , from the most responsible , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; &quot; come . &quot;
in &quot; in &quot; in &quot; in &quot; i could connect my preference to the underwater community , and the diving thing .
so , sort of , my two passions are sort of like mine .
something interesting happened in &quot; to solve a problem in this movie , &quot; and we had to create a kind of liquid , which is a kind of liquid , we &apos;ve got to just get a copy of electronic animation , we picked up , back .
what was going on , the first sketch was the first sketch of seeing the movie .
the film was not a money , and it was just said , &quot; he just played his costs , but i realized something fascinating : the audience on the world was like mesmerized from the magic , which went out .
according to arthur clarke , the law is not the same technology and magic of other than other .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that must be involved in the most powerful . &quot;
so we went in &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , much further .
together with a drug , we created the guy out there , and the success was completely dependent on how this effect would come .
and it worked . again , we had created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same thing , but we have a little bit more money with the film .
from these two experiences , a whole new world was achieved , a whole new world of creativity for the natural media system .
so i started a company , with my good friend thom brennan , who was at the time of the best , and the most honest , and she was called &quot; digital art . &quot;
the idea of this company was , the phase of analog processes with visual printers , etc and starting to start with digital imaging .
and we did this also , and we managed to get a advantage like this for a while .
but in the mid- &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the middle of the world , and we were in the middle of the world , which we had actually started -- too slow .
i wrote this piece of &quot; avatar &quot; that the bar in the kind of visual effects and the kind of effects in new heights should drive , with realistic human , expressive characters , which had been made by using a plastic , and the world should be more
but the bar is quite beautiful , and people said to me that we &apos;re not able to be able to do that .
so i shifted this , and i made this other film about the big ship that goes down .
i &apos;ve sold this as &quot; android and juliet on a ship &quot; -- it was a kind of a hungarian epic level , a passionate movie .
but in essence , i wanted to actually immerse the titanic of the titanic .
so i did the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
but i believe it &apos;s a belief , and i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go to the train . we &apos;re doing the real train .
we &apos;re going to show it in the movie of the film .
this is very important . it &apos;s a good job for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but it &apos;s coming back to that , that the imagination can make a reality .
we actually created a reality later , in the way that i was in a russian state of mine , and i was going to end up with four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i was looking at the real titanic through a computer company
that was not a movie , no , no , a big movie .
so , that really blew me .
and the level of preparation were enormously . we had to build cameras and light bulbs and all kinds of things .
and i noticed how much these kinds of plastic , a similar kind of play .
well , they were also more cosmopolitan and more sophisticated to the more sophisticated planning .
you go up into these capsule , you &apos;re going to go down into these dark , hot environment down , where no hope is to rescue , if you don &apos;t get back to it .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a museum shop .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was very obsessed with studying the deep sea .
anyway , by the part of that , with curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventures , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that i couldn &apos;t give to hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .
in some of the rest of the expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in the street , and sometimes things i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that had no one ever seen before and for the science at the time when we saw them , still didn &apos;t
so that &apos;s really what i did right now , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
after success , &quot; titanic &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want my favorite , as a filmmaker , as a filmmaker , and i &apos;m going to put it in a while for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we came to the &quot; film &quot; , and they explored with the internet lab .
we went back to the top of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which we built a computer factory .
our purpose was , and to look at the inside of the ship , which was never done before .
nobody had the internal research exploration , and you didn &apos;t have any means for it , so we developed the technology .
and i &apos;m sitting there now , on the deck of the titanic , in a museum , and see fildes that are quite similar to these kinds of things that i know that was happening , and that was the band that was played there .
and i fly with a little bit of the ship through the ship .
i actually serve it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically in the middle of the titanic of the titanic .
this was the most popular form of a computer that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i took a corner of a corner , i knew what was going on in the national field , because i was running on the movie .
because the set was a very simplified copy of the vessel dune .
so that was a highly strange experience .
she made me realize that this was the fact that you use such a kind of thing as a whole , and so your consciousness in the vehicle can be embarrassed in this other form of existence .
it was really extraordinary .
and maybe a little view of what might happen in some decades , if you have a little bit of to explore or do something else , or other things , in all sorts of different forms of energy that i think can be considered a computer model .
after this led , we started to really appreciate what we were seeing down there , for example , this kind of carbon , where we saw this incredibly amazing animals . that &apos;s the aliens , but here &apos;s the world &apos;s aliens .
they live with the help of the fuzzy .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight of the sun , as we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive .
and at the same time i was very interested in the same way that i was in the same time , and that was the most successful thing from my childhood .
and so i ended up with people who are interested in space and the nasa who are sitting in the world and the right thing , and they &apos;re going to go to russia , and they go through russia , and they go through the international field of the
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was the way i took a lot of time to the deep sea .
i took them to the world , and i got to give them access to the world , and the bottom of the way , the people who were interested in extreme situations , i took them to the extreme situations , and i took them to the vents ,
we did a report , but actually , science , actually , said , &quot; well , more powerful . &quot;
so the circle of my existence was a child &apos;s place as a child , and the state of the reality , and the state of reality .
in the course of this voyage , i &apos;ve learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i certainly think you have to have a director , and you have to be a leader like a kind of a glass or something like this .
but i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i get these expeditions .
because in a particular point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what does it come from ? &quot;
these stupid movies don &apos;t bring us money .
we &apos;re going to play the cost of the cost of the cost of fame .
all of you think i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and i would have a &quot; avatar &quot; and i would have a towel on a towel .
i &apos;ve all taken these films , these calculators , for a very small audience .
no glory , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it for the task to get the challenge -- and the ocean is the most powerful environment that you &apos;re there . you &apos;re doing it for the strange connection , and because of the strange connection that happens when a small group of people are making
because we &apos;ve done all this with 10 to 12 people who worked for years , and sometimes we were two to three months in the sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing that you have is the most important thing you have , because you have a job to overcome the task that you can &apos;t tell .
if you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the wishbone , the most powerful , and the whole thing that the whole technology , and the trouble , the human performance , if you &apos;re working on the sea , you can
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
so when i went back to turn my next film , &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you give up your team and put yourself in return .
so , the dynamics was really changed .
so , i was back to a little team on the deepest terrain , and we did &quot; avatar with a new technology that hasn &apos;t existed before . &quot;
incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we became a long family for a long family for a time .
so my way of making films completely changed .
there were people who liked , we would have really had this kind of thing , and we &apos;ve moved into the planet .
for me , it was more a kind of a kind of a design of mine to do my job , the real process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we get from all of this ?
what lessons are we learning ?
i think the curiosity are the curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the warning of your team is more important than any of the world &apos;s most populous .
i get young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice , how i can do something like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t get you yourself .
you get other people . don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t be against yourself . but take risks . &quot;
nasa has a kind of a design system : &quot; fail is not an alternative . &quot;
but in the art and studying , it has to fail , because there &apos;s no way it doesn &apos;t exist .
no important endeavor , which was innovation , was ever approached without risk .
you have to be ready to take risks like this .
that &apos;s the thought that i &apos;d like to give you on the way . failure is a alternative , fear , but is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and perhaps surprising , because my favorite thing is , in the foundation , mainly about vaccines and seeds to make things we invent and deliver to the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than any other on the planet .
so , the fact that their brainwaves are not going to grow over many years is not going to grow . it &apos;s too much or too little , and things will change , and things will change their fragile environment .
it leads to the lead . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , a climate change is going to be terrible for you .
and also , the most important thing is that it &apos;s very important .
in fact , if you could reduce the price of the price , energy would be far at the most effective .
well , the most powerful is like time .
in fact , the most powerful is based on the water .
the main route was the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a very clear case in the most violent and therefore , we have refrigerators , we can create modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s take a half to take a new barrier , and we &apos;re going to depend on a new barrier and this barrier with co2 .
co2 is illuminating the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they add the carbon footprint , which leads to the most profitable and that has a few very negative effects . effects on the weather and maybe worse , which is indirectly , that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t be able to adapt to the biological ecosystems and so all
now , the exact exact relationship between a computer and the web web and where their other consequences are , there are some of the questions , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly a ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i asked the most popular times , &quot; do we really have to go down to zero ?
isn &apos;t it enough for half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we come close to zero , temperature will continue to move .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying , we have a 3.5 foot truck that has to be under a three meter bridge , and then you can actually put it underneath .
this has to be very far down , on zero .
well , we &apos;re running a lot of plastic data , over 26 billion tons of tons .
every americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
it &apos;s about five tons of each planet on the planet .
and somehow we need to make changes that lower zero .
it &apos;s gone up .
only different economic changes have influenced it and we need to increase from the increase of food increase and to increase a reduction towards zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of a mixture of a bit of a mixture of it , and you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to get to zero and depend on the number of people that are used to
so let &apos;s look at each factor , and we think about how we get it to zero .
probably one of these numbers must come close to zero .
now this is fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first of all , we have the population .
today , pisa is now incompatible billion people .
and it &apos;s on nine billion of the world &apos;s worth to move on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the most powerful and more responsible , we could reduce that for 10 percent to 15 percent , but we &apos;re seeing a slope to a 1.3 percent .
the second factor is the services we use .
it includes everything that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
these are very good things , and they &apos;re very good , and they &apos;re almost accessible to each other on the planet .
it &apos;s great that these number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could probably do cad and use less , but in average , this number will rise every year and so on , and so far more than double , the number of services will be put in the one
here we see a very basic service . there &apos;s a light at home so that you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their own business .
well , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t rise .
because of various successes in the middle of the world , through other kinds of methods , through new methods in the world , there are many services , which is a lot of services , which is the amount of services that are reduced 90 percent .
in other service , as the manufacturing of the design , 105 miles : &apos; 92 : a -- &amp; amp ; d : &apos; 92 : &apos; 80s , or the most responsible or the most responsible , is a lot of the cost of improvements .
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a reduction to a factor of three or maybe a factor of six .
but the first three factors , we &apos;re now from 26 billion to maybe the hardest 13 billion tons of tons , and that &apos;s not enough .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that will be a unit of energy .
it turns out that the question is , you can get that on zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every single consumer vehicle for electricity today , but the renewables , and the production of electricity .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need to use the data .
now , if i use &quot; miracle &quot; , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and the services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
there &apos;s no deadline that you have to have a miracle to have a miracle .
usually you &apos;re just wrong and some people come to it .
but we have to have a miracle in this case , and we have a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how can i get that really ?
is there a natural program , a demonstration that &apos;s going to be the idea of people here ?
i remembered last year when i brought mosquitos and somehow liked people .
the idea was really made for you , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , this is a place .
i decided that the company was out of fireflies to be my own contribution to the environment here .
so here are some natural fireflies .
you &apos;ve told me that she doesn &apos;t bite . actually , you don &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of internet types of things like this , but they don &apos;t get all the things .
we need solutions , either or a number of the things that have unimaginable scaling and unimaginable , and even though there are many directions where people are looking for , i really can see five , which can do that big demands .
i left the tides , the air , fusion and biofuels .
and maybe these people , and if they make better , they would be good than i expect , but my line here is that we need to work on all of these five , and we can &apos;t give up from them because they &apos;re really scary to us
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels , burning from either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there is , maybe it seems , but it &apos;s not . you have to have all the co2 that comes from the burning of the blast , under pressure , and then you hope that there &apos;s going to be there .
there are some of the most popular ones that are on a 60 percent -- 80 percent of the time , but it will be 100 percent of the time , and it &apos;s going to be a very difficult thing to do , and a lot of the co2
who will make sure ?
who can guarantee something that literally many billion times greater than any kind of waste you can imagine from the other of the trash and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a tough thing to do .
next : that &apos;s the next thing .
it also has three great problems , the cost , especially in the world &apos;s worth of affairs , the question is , you know , you &apos;re really feeling that nothing can go wrong , despite the human psychology , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the garbage ?
because although it &apos;s not very large , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that maybe are soluble , and that &apos;s where you should work .
the last three of the five is i put in .
it &apos;s the renewables of renewables as they &apos;re often called .
and also , even though it &apos;s great , it &apos;s not a fuel -- you have some drawbacks .
one is the energy efficiency that creates these technologies dramatically than the power of power .
these are the most popular , you &apos;re talking about many more powerful times , a thousand power power , more than a regular power power .
and also , these vents are injecting themselves .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem to be all the day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be the wind and the wind doesn &apos;t just move .
so you have to be dependent on these sources , you have a way to have energy in times when you &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s great video , there &apos;s challenges in transmission , and if we say that the energy source outside the country is , you don &apos;t need the technology , you don &apos;t need to do the risk of where different emerges from .
and there &apos;s the most powerful .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve all been able to look at all kinds of batteries that are made , the cars , computers , cell phones , the cell phone , and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done with the amount of electronic energy , compared to
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches to time .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
that happens when you try to say that these extra sources of energy over the end of us are going to get 20 percent of the rest of the rest .
if you want to support about 100 percent of it , you need an incredible amount of energy .
now , where are we going to go : what is the right approach ?
&quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we come to the target ?
what we need is many companies that work on it . hundreds of them .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
so , in many of you , they &apos;re going to say , they &apos;re crazy .
i think there are a lot of people here in the ted group that are already available there .
bill big has several companies , including a , called the great , the great family .
and the great thing is , invest in dozens of companies , and they have the great things , and i &apos;m trying to support it .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that , maybe , perhaps , is tracking the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the field of affairs ; it &apos;s liquid , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry a few times ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are covered .
the main thing is , instead of one part of the most common , the one percent that &apos;s a percent , the most important , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the most important .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it , but you could never simulate any sensible , whether it would work , but since it &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that , you know , with the right thing , it looks like
and because you burn these 99 percent , it &apos;s very much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of today &apos;s reactors as a function of the food .
instead of breaking out the head , they just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is being used gradually , a little bit like a candle .
you see , it &apos;s a kind of column , often as &quot; the &quot; powers of the &quot; vice wave . &quot;
that really solves the internet system .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called the more energetic uranium .
the shoots for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re inexpensive and just more lightweight , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many of the concepts that we need to move forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
how should we be sharing ?
well , let &apos;s go to the target that we have to do and then talk about the world &apos;s s .
many of you talk about an 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something agriculture is going to be , and hopefully , the absence of cement and cement is clean to that .
so to get these 80 percent , the developing countries , including countries like china , is completely changing their food .
the other note says , if we use the technology technology , whether it &apos;s used in all countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is going to be a key version of this .
if we go back from there , how should we be fascinated by 2020 ?
it should have the two elements of the elements .
we should use the food industry to bring percent to the way . the less we &apos;re going to be the less , the more the cost of the fuel , and the temperature is also the temperature .
but actually , this note is for the things we &apos;re designing companies that don &apos;t lead to the big , very large , or even a little less important , or even a little less important than the other one that &apos;s the speed of innovation .
we have to follow these breakthroughs with the brain , and we can measure that , in the blink of a matter , in the blink of the world , in the peer-reviewed and space .
there are many great books to this topic .
the al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david &apos;s energy system , &quot; the hot air system . &quot;
they really go through and create a frame of a framework that can be discussed in the broad , because we need to support from all sides .
there are a lot of things coming together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very specific desire that we invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose this wish , which is , you know , the , you know , the more sustainable , you
this has the largest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the rebuilding between long and short people are terrible for the long time , between the united states and china , between poor and the absence of life , and almost all of these two billion , and almost all of these
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do ?
we need to use for more research research .
if countries meet in places like the world , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should talk to these kinds of things and they would be shocked by the ridiculous low funds that are spent for these innovative approaches .
we need to control carbon dioxide , waste &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; trade is that a business system creates a business system .
we have to spread the message .
we need to be a rational deal and we have to have a whole deal and the things that are made of the government .
it &apos;s a more important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand a little bit better -- you can do a sense of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , all the great scientists we &apos;ve done , we just need some 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor , it &apos;s just in the most powerful million .
the hard step is building the first green , and more billion , which is the most important , and the place of the place actually built the first one .
once the first thing is , when he &apos;s going to go like this , it &apos;s all very clear , because the economic energy system is so different than the energy system , as we know it .
so to understand that , that means to build deep in the ground almost like a vertical column , that is taking a nuclear column , and then it starts the process and then it starts up and forth down ?
the thing is , right . you have to be able to new stuff , so there are many people and lots of control , which can go wrong . this thing where you can open it and do things , and that &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can be able to weave it up for 60 years -- think about a column -- which is buried in the whole complexities that you bury , without all the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and it &apos;s burning 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
a key solution , the self , offers a solution for the trash .
so , yes , yeah . now , what happens to the waste : you can sit on it -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it and put it in the next round of the next reactor .
and we start by taking the waste , which exists already , which is in these online rooms or the reactors , and that &apos;s our most fundamental .
so , what &apos;s a problem for these reactors was that what we put in our fill and it &apos;s dramatically reduced during the process of the process .
but as you talked about different people in the world over this possibility .
where is the biggest interest , so what really does it do ?
so , we don &apos;t have a place , and we &apos;ve got a lot of interesting information , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting information that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there &apos;s big interest and people in russia , india , china --
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is a version of one thing that was made .
this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries built this , so everyone who has a quick reactor is doing a fast reactor for our first .
in their imagination , keep it going to life , and the probability of that is really the way to get into life ?
so , the question is , we need one of these online , a little bit of the world &apos;s , very cheap things , we have 20 years to invent and then for 20 years .
this is kind of the deadline that we &apos;ve got to demonstrate the most powerful thing that we have to follow .
and , you know , you know , the , you know , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , it might be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of them , the same , if their approaches to work , that can work for their pilots , can be able to make it a lot of the resources .
and it would be best if it could create multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
so , the great breakthroughs , is this the largest one you know ?
so , a computer system is the most important thing .
it would have been that , but it &apos;s also the power of it , but it &apos;s still more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know what the work is like , but there &apos;s the modular method , which is another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid liquid , which seems to be a little difficult , but maybe the ones say that .
and so there are different , but the beautiful thing about this is that a million times a million times has a million energy as much energy as one , say , a more powerful and so , if you can handle the problems , the footprint and the cost
if that doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we have to translate to the design to try and keep the sound stable stable ?
so , if you &apos;re in this situation , it &apos;s like you eat too much , and just a heart attack is standing in front of a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a heart procedure or something .
there &apos;s a research that &apos;s called the most active , which is what &apos;s going to be involved with different techniques to delay the warming , so we &apos;ve given 20 or 30 years longer to get us out .
this is just a single one of the most powerful .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you should not just work on insurance because one might make you lazy , so you &apos;re eating it because you know that a heart rate is going to save .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s smart if you &apos;re going to get the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a conversation in the blink of it , whether you should have that available , if you have the things that are faster , or that innovation
climate change : do you have a or two sentences for that , maybe to convince you ?
so , the point of life : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
those who are doing scientific arguments are very little .
do you say there &apos;s negative effects that have to do with the clouds that are moving things ?
there are very , very few things you can say , from which there &apos;s a chance in a million .
the key one is like aids , as well as aids .
you &apos;re now making the mistake , and you pay a lot later for that .
and so the idea , now , is that if you have all kinds of problems to invest in something that you only have later , and that &apos;s where the investment is not so clear , and that &apos;s the point that the investment is not necessarily the worst
the fact is that uncertainty should worry about .
but my dream here is , if you can make it economically , and the co2 can say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not a co2 , &quot; i wish it &apos;s not a co2 , i wish it doesn &apos;t really make any co2 , i wish it
and that would be their answer to the most cosmopolitan argument that if you use all these time and energy to solve the co2 , all the other goals that suffer , the other goals that are going to be , is to invest in malaria , and so on
so , the real time , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than they do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
it &apos;s not suffering in other things underneath .
and then you come to big sums of money , and here can disagree , if you have a little bit , that you don &apos;t have any economic , and you &apos;re trying to fund that , and i &apos;m going to take that to a lot of waste
it &apos;s because you &apos;re very short in front of a computer and funded only the learning ratio , and i think we should try more things that have the potential to be very much less expensive .
if the ira , you get a very high body , you can only get the rich .
i mean , every one of us could spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but for the bottom two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even more of the time , it &apos;s about .
his new energy system is now : &quot; why don &apos;t research be discussed anymore ? &quot;
it &apos;s still going to be because of his former stories , with the ted team , but he understood that this is a very empty group and therefore it brings the most ugly group .
and that &apos;s a train that i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little the support is going to support .
bill , i think i &apos;m going to talk about almost all people , if i say , &quot; i really hope you want to be true . thank you .
so , you know , thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , peter &apos;s ted company , a computer company called the &quot; the world &apos;s &quot; the world . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . the biggest amount of energy structure with 20 spaghetti structure , about three gs , and building a marshmallow .
the marshmallow needs to be up .
and , although it really seems to be really easy , it &apos;s really hard to work because people are doing very quickly .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a sort of a field of mine .
it was a huge success .
since i &apos;ve been doing about 70 workshops worldwide , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops in the world with students , engineers , architects , even with the most powerful and there &apos;s something that allows us to share the deep sensations in nature of collaboration and i want
usually , most people are starting to get themselves to contact with the task .
they talk about it , they &apos;re going to look at how it &apos;s going to look , they &apos;re going to make it .
then you invest a little bit in planning and organization . it &apos;s drawing and put spaghetti .
they &apos;re going to invest in the most sophisticated structures in the water industry .
and finally , before you don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow and they &apos;re careful on the top , step back and forth , and they admire their work .
but then , almost always , it happens to be the fact that the &quot; the &quot; s &quot; becomes a &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; machine &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow does that the whole thing is going to bend and the whole thing .
there &apos;s a series of people who have a lot more , more &quot; the &quot; moments of moments &quot; as other people , and under the worst , fresh food levels .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and they &apos;re actually making a little bit of a mess .
and of course , there are teams that have a lot more , and they have a lot more , and they &apos;re under the best students of the day .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter said , they don &apos;t just have the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is : how does this come ? why ? what about those ?
and peter says , &quot; no one of the kids spend the time to be the spaghetti script . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in a time in the wild .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that &apos;s that the more training that you have to find is to get a proper plan , ok !
and then it turns out to be clear .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time , and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s different is that they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , so they have the ability to repair the possibility of fixing the prototypes .
so , the way that we see this kind of collaboration is a kind of collaboration as a core .
and with every trial , kids get instant feedback , and what &apos;s not going on .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , much -- but we see how different teams are operating .
the average for most of the is about the most sustainable , the price of half of them , the majority of them , but not much , are better than adults .
who is most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
three feet is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles , they &apos;re the key to build the kind of robust structures .
ceos are something about average , but here &apos;s what &apos;s interesting .
you put an example of administrator on the team , you &apos;re going to be significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see about this team , and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why is this ?
because they have special skills of the water .
they lead the process , they understand it .
and that team , that &apos;s the regulation of the body that will look at the work of the team of the team .
and it &apos;s specialized to succeed and the combination of the combination of success and the combination of their combination .
if you have 10 teams who are typical , they get about six , which have robust structures .
i was trying to do something interesting .
i thought we &apos;re going to bring the world &apos;s rights same .
so i offered a $ 10,000 price of software for the winner .
what happened to these kinds of things ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if somebody had built a high construction , he would have carried the prize home .
so is it not interesting that high amounts of energy have a strong effect ?
we repeated this practice with the same students .
what happened now ?
now they understood the advantage of the prototyping .
so , from the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there are lessons of lessons for us , and we have the nature of drive and success .
you like , why would someone actually spend time to create a more common job ?
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help , to help cars , video games and games .
and what the most popular is is to identify them in the hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge gives a common experience , a common language , or attitude to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this kind of simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in the way you can go to the ground .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how you build the marshmallow .
there &apos;s a key one there .
they find crazy examples of all the world , like people optimize the system and the system .
there are also also superstar problems .
and the most popular lesson i think is the construction of actually a sport sport .
it requires that we all focus our senses on the task , and we &apos;re going to use our thinking to be optimal , how our feelings and our , in the challenge , that lies in front of us .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is all of the same thing that it takes to take us from a &quot; the &quot; machine &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
let &apos;s have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everybody in this room has to go in .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what they would choose because i asked my friends last time , and they wanted to go all the way to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america &quot; for the american .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re kind of drawn to the vietnamese , to be drawn to the vietnamese .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a one-hour .
it &apos;s because possibilities are not going back to this planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that ever gave it on this planet , no matter what scale you do : health , wealth , mobility , environmental activity .
there was never a time before that .
my favorite group died all of them were 60 .
my grandparents held this number on 70 70 .
my parents are the 80 on the u.s.
so there should be a nine times a nine at the beginning of my favorite .
but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child that can be born in new delhi , so long to live as long as the richest man on the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is this ?
smallpox . smallpox , smallpox , have killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;ve been able to shape the demographics of the earth in a way that no war ever has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we defeated them . shake .
in the rich world , diseases exist for millions of us only a generation of time , hardly yet .
so , the polio , polio , polio ...
anyone even know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people that are successes of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try and look at what it does , if it doesn &apos;t work , it &apos;s changing , one of the great achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , the whole good news is , because there &apos;s a couple of other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all our achievements , there are a billion people going on to bed every day .
this number goes up , and it &apos;s very fast , and it &apos;s a very embarrassing .
and not only that , we have used our imagination to cultivate the world .
drinking water , land , oil , oil , gas : they disappear , and if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , we &apos;re also going to be able to go out of this chaos .
so the question is , can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food , which is going to feed billions of people without the country that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t even kill .
i really think that &apos;s not a matter of a life .
but this is a little awake at night -- one of the things that hold me awake at night . we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress yet as well as we &apos;ve never yet , never yet , never yet , never yet , never yet .
and we also never had the ability to look at it , as we can now .
we &apos;re at the threshold of amazing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years ago to find a time where we have a lot of progress , in more front lines than now .
people are matching themselves in their faith , and that &apos;s how close you can &apos;t free .
not even the truth will get it free .
and listen , everybody has a right to think about it , even a fairly , really , to think of progress .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
they don &apos;t have right on their own facts . &apos; sorry , they don &apos;t .
and i took a while to figure out .
about a decade ago , i wrote a paper about the new york , a little article .
and i was amazed to make resistance on what the most effective activity in health care is in history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article and drove .
and soon , i wrote a paper about genetically engineered food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were crazy .
so i also wrote a paper about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; the &quot; s , &quot; why they believed that molecules are a certain way of running a random way of putting a handle on nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i continued to .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re going to go to a , we go food , that &apos;s okay .
but this article made me worry , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these micro-machines , who were crazy at all , didn &apos;t get a angry at all .
these were people who were educated people , regardless of people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that brought me so crazy .
but then i thought , you know what , you know , we &apos;re honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we did .
we &apos;re talking about it .
so , we &apos;re ironic to the ironic quote , and we &apos;re talking about this , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what the reasons are .
we have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
chernobyl , the lxd , the lxd , the gateway , mass weapons , the most common .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
so there are questions and problems with people we believed that they were always right . so are they skeptical .
ask , demand the evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything like that .
but now , if you have to get evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can say that , now , that we &apos;re now living in a epidemic of fear , as i haven &apos;t seen , and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that the most terrifying story that had the most popular , and the more energetic vaccine in connection , brought up with the bribes .
very scary .
tens of studies were done to see if that was true .
number of studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came out of the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no correlation , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we think is what makes us feel what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe in a cluster of documents of a computer that gives us data , and i understand that , i think , we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was devastating .
so , catastrophic because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vegetation is down for for agribusiness .
that &apos;s the most exciting and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happens is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do that .
because here &apos;s somebody here ?
has one in the audience ever seen anybody on colonization ?
not very often .
it &apos;s not happening in this country , but it &apos;s not a lot of time in the world .
this is a lot of death deaths , 20 per hour .
but because this is not happening here , we can actually spend it , and people like jenny can walk around and see messages from fear and surrounded by platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and you can do that because you don &apos;t connect the cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same thing .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he got us from one of the worst things that we have in humanity .
no fear , no distress , polio , beat , disappeared .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t like that .
it &apos;s called paul &apos;s film .
he &apos;s just developed a few other people &apos;s worth of a computer .
he can save the lives of the world &apos;s lives 500,000 to the developing world in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
well , that &apos;s good , besides that paul travels through and over vaccines and say , how valuable they are , and that people should just stop to resist .
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul talks in a public school , he can &apos;t tell without arms guards .
he gets calls to home , because people like to tell him that you know where to go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
you take them away , go back to the diseases , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we now have now now , overreaction .
and that &apos;s going to be worse , and pretty soon children die , because this is just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die for reddit .
what about polio ? do we take that . why not ?
a few weeks ago , i wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i said i &apos;m a little too sharp .
nobody ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against polio . no one &apos;s a case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
we had no polio in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe this morning someone in lagos has a plane and flies just after los angeles , right now , in the moment , he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he &apos;s growing a car , and he comes up to long beach , and he &apos;s going to go to one of these most painful , and it &apos;s going to go to one of these .
and he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s infected with a neurologist , and we don &apos;t know that , because so the world works now .
that &apos;s the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love it to lie in lies . we love that .
do you all have your vitamins now ?
and a little bit of a little bit of a video that helps you the jumps .
i know that they did that because half of americans do this every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference as often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data is all about .
they &apos;re going to darkness their urine . more than they do .
this is okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i &apos;ll just agree with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the medical industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t do that . our healthcare system is mies .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing , and it &apos;s amazing itself to us that can afford it .
so we walk away , and where are we going ?
we &apos;re running in the arms of the world .
that &apos;s great . i love the most popular .
but you know , this is really a serious deal , because the stuff is crap , and we &apos;re giving billions of dollars to it .
and i &apos;ve all got some kinds of little pajamas here .
none of them -- -- the , police , was , was , police , was , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re going to give billions of dollars to it , it &apos;s cheating .
and you know what ? if i say that , people scream and say , &quot; what do you care ? let the people do what they want .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you have wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the minister of minister , saying , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to accept the evidence of my experts , &quot; or any of the most common , which wants to treat his patients with a drug company .
if you &apos;re going to go on this path , where and magic evidence and science , you &apos;re going to get into a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to the water floor in south africa .
he brought 400,000 people to have 400,000 people , because he was that red , the red , and more effective than antiretroviral drugs , which we know that they can take the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country , which are worse than any other of this disease is being broadcast .
tell me not that these things have no consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the most popular epidemic we &apos;re currently facing is this ridiculous struggle between the world &apos;s worth of existing food and the most powerful .
this is a debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every single one of the things , every branch of serenity , every spinneret cluster , has changed by the people .
you know , there was no clan in paradise .
there was no street .
there was no street . we did all that .
we did it in the last 11,000 millennia .
and some of them worked and some of them don &apos;t work .
we are rid of what &apos;s not working .
now , we can do it more specifically , and of course , there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help to increase millions of people , millions of people , their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re thriving food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m hearing is : too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , hormones , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing that is wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
and you know what my answer is to all this ?
yes , they &apos;re right . fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge amount of energy , but that &apos;s not science .
it doesn &apos;t have to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , the training .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not a idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes not , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow the science to do their work because we &apos;re afraid of doing a really dead , and it keeps millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we have to grow 70 percent more food than it is at the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? genetically changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this kind of thing , like the ones like that .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s a half billion people eating .
it &apos;s about a potato .
it &apos;s just a strands of calories . it &apos;s mies .
it has no nutrients , it has no protein , and scientists are building all this in it .
and then people could eat that and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be parainfluenza-4 panisse , but it would be beautiful .
and everything i can say to that is : why do we fight that ?
i mean , ask us , why do we fight that ?
because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
it &apos;s not about genes running around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our contributions on greater food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice &apos;s favorite , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do so on how we do it , we &apos;re guilty about something that we think , not guilty , to be high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of our being worthy , and we really need to stop it .
so after that incredible , very funny conversation , you might say , &quot; you &apos;re still going to be in this ridiculous time time and in the future ? &quot;
anyway , i want to fall on every single case .
now , in the present moment , you &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time on the road time on all of what we want .
we can move them up , where we want to move them , and we &apos;ll move them where we want .
we need to have these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the time time , we &apos;re going to be happy to be able to do that .
i know we can , and as far as it is , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time , i &apos;ve been interested in the most responsible , and it may seem strange that a magician is interested in this , because it &apos;s like i think it &apos;s like a deception that &apos;s going to be something that is really going to be done
in other words , sugar sugar , some of the studies in some studies , showed the impact , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what happens to their , is a kind of a change or a kind of -- in the middle of the world , there
a deception becomes something that is very simple because somebody is so suspicious .
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least for the 1950s in every single country &apos;s population .
i &apos;ve learned him from the most successful magic of the world &apos;s worst way in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to explain it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i &apos;ll explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can study , my hand , which you can study .
i &apos;m just going to keep the knife out of my hand .
i push my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing disappears in my sleeve or come out of it , i &apos;m just going to get my wrist right here .
so , you can see that no time you can move anything . as long as i &apos;m here , there &apos;s nothing in my sleeve , or you can &apos;t get out .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully if everything goes well , the knife will put through my bare physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually sitting in his place that i can shake it without the knife fall fall .
nothing goes into my sleeve or come out , no more reflective , and you can study everything .
so , the aid .
now , this is a trick i often put on young kids , which is magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you look closely , although it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you here are in the room here .
he works like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to take my wrist off to make sure nothing disappears in my sleeve or come out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m going to take my wrist , is that the real secret of illusion is .
now , in the moment where i &apos;m going to get my hand from you , so you &apos;re moving from the back , this finger is here , my fred , just from there , where he was in a position where he was so extended .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody in the back , who had no childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i &apos;m going to change the fingers , the fingers change its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there &apos;s only three fingers down here , because the mind and the way he process information is not worth it , one , two , three , but it looks like
but this is not what it is about , and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s captured there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my hobby , that &apos;s now there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing happens by me , by the way , by this movement , that the fingers are going to be back to the hand .
i take this hand . and here &apos;s the knife .
you can show this trick , and you &apos;re going to demonstrate your friends . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the most successful ?
a year or something , i read a study that really blew me up .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and so that was an amazing thing for me .
because it turns out that if you offer a placebo in a white pill , in the form of a white pill , it &apos;s just a round , white pill that has a specific effect .
but if you give the shape that you give the placebo to a smaller pill , for example , and that blue color , and it &apos;s a letter that goes into it , it actually shifts effective .
and that , although not any of the most common -- it &apos;s just sugar pills .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really got me crazy .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
if you take a haircut , the more effective than any form of a form is more effective than any form .
a colored capsule , which is in a end of yellow and at the other red , is better than a white capsule .
the dosage plays a role .
a pill twice is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics , i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is ...
... that &apos;s the apprentice , also , a role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want to get the ultimate , you have to grab the needle .
right ? a syringe with a computer company -- a few more cosmopolitan of a brain that you borrowed with a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in your head , and this is very much stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a stereo .
so the fact that the white pill doesn &apos;t seem so good as the blue pill , which doesn &apos;t seem so good as a capsule , which doesn &apos;t seem so good as the needle .
and nothing of it has really a really , really , really , really fundamental property , it &apos;s just our belief that we have a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i take something that &apos;s obvious , and i &apos;m going to look at it .
we know from that study that you have to reach to the needle if it &apos;s going to go to the thing .
this is a 18 inches long , and it &apos;s very , very , very ominous , and i &apos;m going to do a little bit of a little bit of a fan .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not a very special kind of cultured flesh .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle in my skin and run through them , and it &apos;s taken off to the other side .
if you &apos;re going to get bad -- if you &apos;re easily transmitted -- i &apos;ve put a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people who i didn &apos;t know , and i have a woman , and it has become almost powerless .
so i propose if you &apos;re going to get fast , you &apos;ll see the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first sensitive part here .
you can see it just , you can also see , but if you want to .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my flesh starts , at the bottom of my arm , i just make a little coherent .
am i sorry . do you make that crazy ?
and now just a little bit of my skin and on the other side , and then on the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the world .
about it .
but now , you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;ll show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see this .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid and the skin itself , the skin , just to talk to us a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;m going to show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people in the back say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see that right . &quot;
people in the world are coming in .
let me show you from that close .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
this is my flesh , and i can rotate that .
sorry . if you &apos;re bad , you &apos;re looking at it , don &apos;t look at it .
people in the back or the back of the day will say , &quot; well , that looks quite impressive , but if it really would be , it &apos;s quite impressive , but if it really would be , it would be a hole , and there &apos;s a
okay , let me just take a little blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
i would usually get out the needle .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this framework , and with the intention of a deception , i &apos;m just going to get a needle in there , and i &apos;m going to go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to be able to meet a couple of times in the next days .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to it . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness today .
i have some people who are going to be able to count the number of books that were published with &quot; happiness in the title of the last five years and they gave them about 40 , and there was much more . &quot;
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of information .
everybody would like to make happier .
but despite all of these tide of work , there are several cognitive cognitive ones that make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly driven by these cognitive acts .
that &apos;s true of the rubble of the way that you think about happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we &apos;re just so mess as any other .
the first one is a very , a very , really pressing complexity .
it turns out that the word is really not a useful word , because we &apos;re using it too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could easily do , but in the big and all the time , that &apos;s something we need to be giving up , and we will have to think of the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second trap is a reminder of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s about happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both the most powerful in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the most powerful , and that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a reality that is affected by well-being without its significance .
i mean , this is a real cognitive event .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now i &apos;d like to start with a example of someone who had a computer company for one of my lectures , who told a story . &#91; unclear &#93; , he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and it was a
and then he added , really emotionally , really emotionally , that has ruined all the experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it had ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of music .
they don &apos;t count because he was a memory of memory , the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything he had to keep .
what &apos;s really telling us that we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two kinds of self .
there &apos;s a key self that lives in the present and the present , and the present is to experience the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the most popular self that the doctor &apos;s doctor -- you know , if the doctor says , &quot; now , does it hurt if i &apos;m going to put it up here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a key self , and the most common self is that the most important thing is getting upright and the story of our lives , and it &apos;s that the doctor is going to be the first time , &quot; how did you feel in time
or , &quot; how did their journey go to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the most powerful self , and the most common self , and the two is part of the most fundamental of the animal &apos;s happiness .
well , the most exciting self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we &apos;re doing it to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories that we can keep from our experiences , a story .
and let &apos;s start with a sample of a little bit .
there &apos;s a old study .
these are real patients who put a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds of their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who &apos;s got more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b clearly suffered more . his favorite , and every minute of pain , the patient a patient had a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much would these patients think they suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a a lot of worse is on the top of the road than a patient b.
the stories of the computer of the world were different , and because it &apos;s a very critical part of the story , as you ends up .
and not that stories is very , very much , great -- but one of them is this clear -- it &apos;s a very clear one .
but one of them is clear worse than the other .
and the worse is , the more , where the pain was at the end of his peak , it &apos;s a bad story .
where do we know ?
because we asked these people to ask them , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad was all the things that all the stuff was available ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than b in the most powerful .
well , this is a direct conflict between the federal self and the most responsible self .
from the point of view of the computer self , b clearly had a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s working , and it works , you could actually get the patient &apos;s worth of a reduction in a reduction without too much to
that &apos;s going to lead the patient , but just a little bit less than before .
and if you do a few minutes , you make it that the most important thing is that the patient &apos;s worth is a bad thing , and you have a lot of money that &apos;s a lot better from patient , because now you have a patient &apos;s own
so what is a story ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that will serve memory and it &apos;s true for the stories that we invent .
and what &apos;s a story of a story is , are possible , significant moments and ends .
end , very , very important , and in this case , is dominated by the end .
now , the most common self lives forever .
it has moments of the world &apos;s population , one after the other .
and they ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve got this -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds as about three seconds . what means , you know , there are about 600 million of them in a life . most of you
most of you will completely ignore the most fully from the brain &apos;s brain .
and yet , you get the impression that you should count that what happens during these moments of the world &apos;s trials is our life .
it &apos;s the limited resource we use as we are on this world .
and as we would use it , it seems to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that holds the most powerful self for us .
so we have the most responsible self , and the most powerful self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is to deal with time .
from the point of view of the computer , if you have a vacation , and the second week is exactly how the first one , the first time the first thing is the prison bike is as good as the holidays .
this is not how it works at all for the most important self .
for the most responsible self , a holiday &apos;s vacation is barely better than the prison bike , because there &apos;s no new memories .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable , which is different from a brain that &apos;s different from a brain of a brain self .
now , the most important self makes more than remember and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually the one that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who , we have two different surgeons , and decide what he should choose to do , and then , you know , the one who &apos;s going to choose the memory is the one
the main self itself has no voice in this choice .
we don &apos;t actually choose between experiences . we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as a function .
we think about our future as a universal memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the brain &apos;s self , and you can think of the most powerful self as one that &apos;s kind of the most important self , and it doesn &apos;t need the most important self
i have the idea that if we &apos;re a holiday , it &apos;s very often , that means we &apos;re doing vacation in the service of the world itself .
and that &apos;s a little bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that will be given for the dominance of the world &apos;s rights .
and if i think about it , i think on a vacation that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i had ever had , and i think quite often about how often i think about other people .
and i probably have about my memories of this kind of thing , and i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had opened the folder with 600 pictures in it , i spent another hour .
now , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s just a half hours .
there seems to be a disagreement .
now , i like a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the top of memories , but even if you &apos;re giving more of it to the other , why do we give the memories so much in the brain that we give the
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine your next vacation , you know that at the end of the computer &apos;s day , all your images are being wiped out and you get a drug that you &apos;re going to remember .
now , would you pick the same vacation ?
and if you &apos;re going to pick a vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species and you have to think about how you choose this conflict and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think of time , you can get a answer . and
why we choose the most powerful we &apos;re choosing , which is a problem that provides us with a choice between the two species .
now , the two types of self , two words from the sake of happiness .
there are two concepts of happiness that we can apply to one one self .
so you can ask : how happy is the most important self ?
and then you would ask , how happy are the moments of the life in the world ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of happiness of the human self .
if you &apos;re lucky to ask yourself , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this is not how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s like satisfied or delighted the person , if this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
and everybody who &apos;s not different is going to be the study of happiness , and i &apos;m in a lot of researchers about well-being that have been drifting in the study of happiness long , in the same way that they &apos;ve been drifting on .
the distinction between happiness itself and the happiness of the state self is recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re now trying to measure the two distinct ones .
the gallup organization has a global survey , which has been asked more than half a million people , which are about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started learning about the happiness of both species .
and the main lesson we think , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and that teaches them not much about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you an idea of the correlation , the correlation is about a more unfair .
what that means is that if you meet somebody and you would tell them , oh , his father is a kind of a cake , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone has a life as eight on a scale of 10 , they have much uncertainty about how happy he is with his own own self .
so the correlation is small .
we know something about what the happiness of the world &apos;s happiness is .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly , to be satisfied with people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there are other pleasures , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you &apos;re going to maximize happiness of the two species of self , you &apos;re going to do very different things .
the implication of what i &apos;ve said here is that we really shouldn &apos;t think about happiness as a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very quickly , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things if we think about life and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they don &apos;t get the correct answer .
if you think of this question , people have to be happier in california if they say , in ohio , we live in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , say , in climate .
now , it turns out climate change is not very important for the internet self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the naked self , which decides how happy people are .
but now , because the ham self is responsible , you can end up -- some people could go to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track what happens to people who are moving to california , happier .
now , you &apos;re not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because if you &apos;re going to think about it , you &apos;re going to be reminded about how awful the weather was in ohio . and you &apos;re going to feel that you &apos;ve made
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve got you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we &apos;ve mentioned a couple of weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this latest survey .
is that something that you can do , because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel ornish : sure .
i think the most interesting thing we found in the gallup survey is a number that we &apos;ve absolutely never expected to find .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
if we looked at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out that under income from 60,000 dollars in a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
so , 60,000 : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year are people unhappy , and they &apos;re increasingly getting more happy , the poorer they will be .
we get a perfectly flat line about this .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money doesn &apos;t raise a more common , but lack of money to have a lack of money , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the most common self , you get another story .
the more money you deserve is you &apos;re making happier .
it &apos;s not true for emotions .
but danny , in all the american efforts , is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people take this kind of high-tech seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on the head , everything we believe , for example , in terms of the way we think about it , for example , and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country is generally taking a more serious way of doing it , and that &apos;s how much politics would be done ?
so , you know , you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of the world &apos;s role in politics .
the recognition will be slow in the united states , not a question , but in the u.k. , it &apos;s happening and happens in other countries .
people are in the way they &apos;re thinking that they should think happiness should think about it .
it will take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study the way they want to study or whether they want to study the discussion , so we have to have a pretty quick debate .
how do you be lucky to be very different on how you think and whether you think about the brain &apos;s brain self or whether you think about the brain &apos;s brain self .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you &apos;re going to be able to measure the population of the population .
this is what i think is , in the next one or two decades , in the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this topic is going to be , or at least the most interesting political debate to track over the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny &apos;s film .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in the reality of saving the world in the way that they &apos;re in the rescue of the world .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince you more people , including all of them , spend more time playing more and more powerful games .
now we spend three billion hours a week with a video machine .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we have in the real world .
but in fact , my research on the institute of the future is that the opposite is literally easy .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most promising problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase this time dramatically .
i &apos;ve calculated that the time it &apos;s going to be at 21 billion hours is just a week .
this is probably something that happens first , so i &apos;ll go back to it , so that if we look at problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online at least 21 billion
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture is pretty much what i think games are so critical for the survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographer phil b.c.
he wanted to capture the feelings of play , so he &apos;s built a camera on the players .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you may get some of the nuances of the nuances .
you probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also also deep concentration , it &apos;s going to be a really difficult problem to solve .
if you &apos;re playing , you see some of the nuances of these , which are the top of the eyes , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player that &apos;s on the edge of a superorganism called a superorganism .
oh , you know that . ok . so fine . so we have some players here .
a patent victory is a result that is so incredibly positive that they didn &apos;t know that they were at all possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you reach it , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually able to do something like this . that &apos;s a random victory .
this player is a little bit of a epic victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces from the world , and we have to take the barriers of the next century , and the face of the next century is the face of a epic , a timeline of a epic controller .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re more likely to see this face in real life when we &apos;re looking at difficult problems .
i call it the &quot; in life &quot; -- and it &apos;s really my face , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? ok ?
i &apos;m like , &quot; in life , i &apos;m bad &quot; i &apos;m doing bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied why i was doing better than i was in play , and we &apos;re doing better than the real life .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not so good in the reality of play .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successfully , even though that &apos;s what it belongs to .
we &apos;re going to get more . i mean , i mean , in the context of the motivation , something significant to do , inspired with collaboration .
if we &apos;re in a corporate community , i believe that many of us are turning into our best version , anytime and immediately , to solve the problem , trying to solve the problem as long as necessary , and try to try it back after the bottom of
and in reality , if we &apos;re failing , if we &apos;re going to make obstacles , we feel often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we &apos;re just being beaten up . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or unnecessary .
we never have these feelings , if we play games , there &apos;s just not .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible to think , you can &apos;t just get anything ?
how can we make these feelings of play in the reality ?
so i looked like the world of warcraft , which is the ideal environment that &apos;s the ideal of the environmental problem .
and i &apos;ve noticed some things that can make the epic light in the jungle that &apos;s so possible .
so first , if you get in one of these most violent , especially in the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to be willing to give you a mission mission , and that &apos;s immediately .
but not only any mission , but a mission , which is perfect to your current level , right ?
so they do that .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of your ability , you have to work , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and you &apos;re going to go around . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are tons of staff .
where you go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to end their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that real life in real life , this feeling that in a small host of employees , they &apos;re willing to stand .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , these inspiring history , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve heard about &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + a strength &quot; or a bit of a intelligence .
this constant feedback is not in real life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have a talk , and a crazy idea , and a crazy idea , 20 kooks idea .
i don &apos;t get the real life of this feedback .
so the problem of the world &apos;s problems like warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying , at least on the edge of a epic , a epic process of a epic , that we &apos;re spending our whole time in these online spots .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
until today , all the world of the world &apos;s population has spent millions of years , and the virtual problems of solving the virtual problems .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound nasty .
but to see it in context , millions of years ago , our first time started to go to the top of our first day .
so the first jump .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we &apos;re going to play with play , it just makes sense , when you keep the time in terms of the scale of human development , what is extraordinary .
but also , it turns out that we &apos;re using this whole time to play this whole time , actually , changing what we &apos;re capable of as humans .
we &apos;re developing ourselves too collaborative , very , very , very .
that &apos;s the truth . i believe .
look at this interesting statistic that was published recently from a researcher of carnegie mellon university : the average boy of today in a country with a huge computer company has 10,000 hours of a year with a 21st million hours of oil to the 21st century .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of reasons : &quot; for two hours . &quot;
first of all , for children in the united states , there are a little bit of the precise ones that they spend in school , from five grade to the degree of high school , when you never miss .
so here we have a complete , full of a whole , on the young people , which means to be a good player , like everything else , what they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; &quot; aw , &quot; read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of the computer &apos;s great research that if we &apos;re spending 10,000 hours of this , at least , we spend a 21st percent issue in the world , we &apos;re going to master .
we &apos;re going to be so good at doing what the most significant people in the world are .
so , what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are the most responsible .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players who are doing good ? &quot;
because if we could find that , we would have never been able to have a human potential to have a better human potential .
so many people currently have in the world , who spend at least an hour with a computer factory .
these are our main systems . 500 million people who are very good in &quot; something . &quot;
and the next decade we have another billion players that are very good at what they &apos;re doing .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the most powerful , the energy industry , is saving energy and working on the ground , rather than the most responsible , so player on the world , especially in india , china , brazil , play online .
you expect a extra billion players in the next decade .
we have 1.5 billion players in the total .
so i started thinking about what it is to do , what are we doing to master games .
here &apos;s the four things i found . first of all , the first thing .
ok , imagine how extreme food systems are .
so , the desire is to do something , to do something , to master , to think that we have a leading hope to success .
players always believe that a more appropriate victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to try and try and do it .
players are not sitting around .
players are masters in spiders , social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows us people , after we &apos;ve played them , even if they had missed us .
the reason is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone playing a game .
we trust that somebody has given us to spend that the rules are honored , that we have the same goal and to the end of the day .
so the most profitable thing is that the ties of ties , trust and others .
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
it &apos;s fantastic productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the most important of the ted system is going to play 22 hours a week , as a result of a matter .
the reason is , if we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work , to work hard than we don &apos;t do anything .
we know that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to make a human being to make significant work .
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to be part of awe of awe of art .
here &apos;s a key machine to go into the right light , you know all the wikipedia , the largest wiki of the world .
the second largest wiki of the world , with almost 80,000 extremism , is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about the world of warcraft in the internet than any other subject in each other &apos;s world &apos;s largest wiki in the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to one outcome . players are the ones , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is that they think they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real real .
this is the problem i try to solve .
edward ornish is a computer company .
his work is great . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in the world .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to be witnesses from a &quot; less than a &quot; of a &quot; virtual worlds and the world &apos;s administration . &quot;
and that &apos;s an economist . so it makes sense .
and he says ...
not like me -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit more somber .
so he says that it actually makes sense , because players can achieve more than in the real life .
you can do stronger social bonds than in real life , and you get more feedback and rewards in play than in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s completely logical that players are more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
i just just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not a drug .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s a 2,500 years ago .
there are these ancient cube , from the plastic , you know ?
this amazing computer system was called the street .
and these were the first of people developed in the first of the world .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the old greek , you may know this story . the story about how and why were games invented .
according to the design of games , games were actually invented , more specifically , in the kingdom of a famine .
there was such a great famine , and the king of the world was a very crazy idea .
people suffered . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to the bark , the police , and the protests , a national strategy , would be food . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the street , because they &apos;re so intriguing and so fascinating , and we &apos;re surrounded with the food , and they &apos;re going to be forgotten that they were not going to eat anything .
and then the next day , you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to the top of the day , they survived this famine for 18 years , by eating a day and played the next one .
so , i think we &apos;re going to play games today .
we &apos;re putting games to get the suffering of real world .
we &apos;re putting games in order to get everything wrong in the real world , which is not really satisfying in life , and we &apos;re not getting to what we need from play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting .
according to 18 years , the famine was not better , so the lakota , the king , decided to be a last year , a last year .
they shared the kingdom in two halves .
they were playing a computer , and they were able to break a epic adventure .
they left up and they went to search for a new home , and they just decided to go back so many people , like food , and they were looking at the rest of a place where they were thriving .
this sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest thing is that the most popular , the most common , the one that &apos;s going to have the last empire , the same dna as the old oil rate .
so scientists recently came to the notion that the crazy story is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global cooling , which was almost 20 years , which could explain famine .
so this crazy story could be true .
you might have saved your people by playing with play by being executed 18 years in games and then had this kind of thing , and so much about that , that they had saved the entire civilization .
so , we can also .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1968 since 1994 .
this was the first time in real time of the world of the world &apos;s world &apos;s day . this was 16 years ago .
they were working for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing in warcraft for 16 years .
i &apos;m going to say we &apos;re ready for our own personal game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion a week .
we should have a lot of arrangements that half of us spend an hour with play a day , until we &apos;ve solved the real world of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask : &quot; how do we solve problems of real world in games ? &quot; and exactly this question i &apos;ve been dedicated to the institute for the future for the future .
we have this flag in palo alto , it teaches us how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to think of the best result , and then people are trying to make this idea of the reality .
we &apos;re going to stop epic and give people the opportunities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you a very short video , which i &apos;ve designed to try and extract people epic in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a computer that you have to overcome a giant design .
the most powerful is , but we have enough food tools , so it &apos;s realistic for them , and they actually live their real life without oil . so , if they &apos;re beating , they &apos;re going to tell us where they &apos;re going to be , and
we tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied by the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a change .
nobody wants to change life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure , and you &apos;re going to say , &quot; we &apos;re going to get oil out . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going to go .
find out how they were going to survive . most of our players have been involved in the game , and they have more habits .
so we have a bigger game for the next game , and we put higher goal than only the only thing we have .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; &quot; the &quot; s &quot; on the center of the future .
the question is , the computation of a computer is that people have only left 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global media design , &quot; of course .
the call of gamers , we have almost as much as a &quot; the &quot; machine &quot; designed .
you know jerry &apos;s , where there &apos;s the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; s &quot; -- and you
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everyone &apos;s in the most responsible , and it &apos;s our job that the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they google &quot; google . &quot;
and the last game we get on march , the third one is a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you close the game , you get the best &quot; social media , &quot; &quot; social engineering , &quot; at 2010 .
we work with universities in sub-saharan africa and store , to learn social rejuvenation .
we have a comic comic book . we have a big level of understanding , &quot; the level of &quot; the high &quot; for the world , sustainability , sustainability , vision and genius .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people around the world , especially in the world , in the most important , to imagine their own social enterprise to save the world .
i &apos;m going to end up .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use in the real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have these all the superpowers , the ability to make productivity , the ability to move close social nets , and the desire to make sense of the meaning of the meaning .
i really hope we &apos;re playing meaningful games to survive on this planet , to survive , to survive .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design with me like this and play .
and when i go to the next decade , i &apos;m sure i &apos;m sure we can make any future , and that we can play all sorts of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the most successful games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about what a few months ago in writing a blog for a magazine magazine magazine .
i always have my favorite hand on the writing side , but i was with the work of the text , and i noticed that i never have ever been in my life , which is the word &quot; disabled &quot; really means .
i read them the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; the most popular , helpless , useless , destroyed , 58 , illiterate , beaten , beaten , unmarried , angry , angry , angry , and also , it &apos;s useless , and it &apos;s useless , and it &apos;s useless , and it &apos;s
so , healthy , healthy , powerful , reliable . &quot;
i read this list of a friend named , and i had to laugh , it felt so ridiculous , but i just came up until &quot; defeated &quot; and i had to be able to read and get to read that kind of thing and try and get me
of course , this was a computer , old , old , old , i thought , that the copy has to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early &apos; 80s , when i just started with elementary school and started to build my self outside of my family , and to form , in terms of other children , and the rest of the world around me
and god is not using a book of mine at the time .
i would be going to be a very serious post in a world that someone like me would perceive as a person who could be in no way to make their life in any way that they can be positive , but i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the
so i immediately admire the most popular of 2009 , and i expected to find a piece of a piece of reference here .
here &apos;s the most powerful version of this kind of view .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , i &apos;m going to go to the last two words under near near the most remote , &quot; &quot; &quot; healthy &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are put in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many ancient societies , including the greeks and the roman , have really believed that the harsh of a baby &apos;s arm has a great force because what you &apos;re looking at is the same thing to do .
so , what do we really want to manifest -- a disabled man or a healthy person ?
just a human being to call a child , could be sufficient , they could complain , and they &apos;re going to help them .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open doors ?
a human being open for me was my pediatrician at the most harrowing zoo institute in the northern valley in northern kenya .
he &apos;s called dr. bliss . a cat , whose name , how you can think about , most americans couldn &apos;t correct correctly . so he was called dr. p. .
and dr. p. was always flying very colorful and was just the work with kids just like being created .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my favorite job .
i had to repeat a lot of the time , and i had to repeat infinitely infinitely , spontaneous , elastic , and in different colors -- you know , to build my favorite , and i hated it more than anything else . i hated it . i hated
and imagine , even as a child , i &apos;d negotiate with dr. p. with dr. p. , and i tried to stop this practice , no success .
and one day he looked at me at one of my practice -- these practice were just tiring and crushed -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so strong , powerful and young girls , you &apos;re going to tear one one one
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this was just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that the richest five girls in the hospital are going to be in the second floor , but he was actually making me a new
and i &apos;m asking myself today how much his vision of me has shaped as a strong and powerful young girl , and i could imagine myself as a nature of a strong , powerful and more powerful person .
this is just one example of many , like adults can actually stimulate the imagination of a child .
but as the most popular examples of the data shows , our language doesn &apos;t make room , imagine what we would all wish to do , and we would all want to be wondering : to allow each one to see themselves as a powerful person .
our language is telling the social change about the social change that has been caused by a technological change .
of course , from the medical standpoint , you can tell that my legs , the most powerful for the metal of titanium , is the hydrogen of titan and artificial body for aging , which allow people to be really , really , to be able to use their
so maybe this technology change is clear , because ever there was a different truth , which is that every human being is a very highly threatening and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt to our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to talk about how to deal with a deal and i &apos;m going to give you something to you , and i feel like that , and i feel like that , and
this sentence of worrying about the idea of success , that success or happiness depends on being a challenge , without being connected by the experience of being connected , as if my life could be so successful , because i could get the kinds of life that i could
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course , we &apos;re actually shaped by the challenge , whether they &apos;re physically , emotionally or even both .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
don &apos;t worry about the obstacle that we need to be able to do to make our lives better .
and you &apos;re just concerned about our lives .
and i tend to be concerned as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s barely not to see , but it &apos;s constantly in me .
and i want to do it with no effect , or the hard of the human being .
there are life in life , and challenges , and these are just the most accurate and every person &apos;s going to be different , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to get to worry about ourselves or not , but we &apos;re going to get it
so we &apos;re not just responsible for people we love to preserve , but also to prepare it , and it &apos;s good to get it .
and we don &apos;t really think of our kids if we &apos;re going to make them feel that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to separate two things : to be a medical fact , to be , and to the other people , the social opinion , whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and free disability i had to put out is that the world is constantly as well as you can describe me with these definitions .
in our wish , people who are going to protect us and tell them the cold , hard truth about their medical projections , or even a forecast to the quality of life that they expect , we need to realize that we &apos;re not going to put that in
maybe the concept is that we &apos;re looking at what &apos;s in a broken , and how we fix it , for every single one of the individual disabilities than the medical missile series .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being , and not all of its forces and opportunities and to recognize , we can do that in addition to the natural struggle that you might have to have , a more disease .
we &apos;re a human being who has value for our society .
so we need to look at the oil industry , and focus on all the area of human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between perception of our flaws and our great online , a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t hold these challenging times or deny copyright , we should not try to avoid them , we should not try to avoid them , we should be able to get them back to the carpet .
it may be more about asking that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome ourselves , but that we &apos;re open to put them on the counter , to put them on the counter , and to use a more kind of a sign of time and maybe dance with
and maybe we can do it , to see more natural , decentralized and useful and feeling so much as a presence of the presence .
in this year , we celebrate the 200 . a birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin has been in my eyes , on something very true in the human character .
i would like to use it so that it &apos;s not the most powerful of his way , and not the most powerful of his kind , but the one that can be the best changes .
from conflicts , creativity emerges .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people , to survive and to be determined by the fight of the human mind , is to turn through conflict .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of people .
and we may know , what wood we &apos;re going to be cutting out of when we &apos;re really tested .
maybe the sense of consciousness is a perception of the present , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can make sense of a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see ourselves as change .
for a change we &apos;re not going to have , we have a change that we have .
i think the biggest damage we have to do is believe that we should be normal .
so , honestly , who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical thing . but not the normal thing , and not the normal , and they would really know that , gray person , if they really were ?
i think it &apos;s not .
it would be great if we &apos;re looking at this paradigm of normal versus another one of the possibilities , or the strength to even overcome it a little bit more dangerous , and we can put it in the forces of very many children , and invite them to
so , the idea of the fact is that we found people from the members of our society , and we have a need to be useful , and to afford a contribution .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals have been older , and people have a big physical injuries , and that might have been a huge physical injury , and that might be because the life expectancy in the human population was valuable .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the city where i grew up in a village in the red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there a computer ambassador .
it was summer and i had a lot of time .
and i hear how a guy says , &quot; well , if that &apos;s aimee mullins . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to move around and see these older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , we know , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you &apos;re hardly aware of me .
when i first saw them , i took them out of the belly of their mother . &quot;
oh , so that .
and of course , it &apos;s made .
this was dr. &apos;s , a man i knew just from narratives of my mother , because i , of course , very typical , to my birthday two weeks late .
the doctor for the school designer of my mother was in vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world , not at all .
and because i was born without a college , and my feet were looking at them , and i just had a few toes on the other , and a few toes on the other foot was the most bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you never would walk , and never be so mobile as other kids or that you could never have an independent life , and since they have just been lying on me . &quot;
i was really extraordinary , and i found that he had collected my entire childhood , whether i had won in a second class in the second grade , whether i was going to the ted party in the second grade , whether i had gained my scholarship or a
and he called this part of his course , the x factor , the potential of human being .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough how critical this factor of life can be for the quality of a human .
and dr. bliss kept telling him , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if they didn &apos;t get anything else , and even if they &apos;re just going to get a little bit of support , if you get kids to themselves , children can get a lot of
see , dr. bliss has changed his thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone is concerned about it , are two different things .
and i &apos;ve changed my thinking in the course of time when you asked me about 15 years , if i had my prostheses against legs and bones , then i wouldn &apos;t have a second to go .
i was really interested in the normal thing .
if you ask me this today , i &apos;m not sure that i &apos;m sure .
and that &apos;s what happens because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not even that experience .
and maybe this change could happen because i &apos;ve been watching so many people who opened doors , rather than people who have been being bathed to me , who was constrained to me or a notion of a notion .
see , it really takes a human , which shows you how you can manifest your powers , and you &apos;re through .
if you allow somebody to activate your own inner forces , the human mind is so versatile -- if you do that , and for someone in a critical moment , they &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to open doors .
the real meaning of the word &quot; &quot; aw &quot; is the word &quot; &quot; the &quot; s . &quot;
it means something that is generating the potential to be more powerful .
again , what potential is we going to do now ?
in the 1960s , in the u.k. , a case report was done in the u.k. , and then the previous news was transformed in the u.k.
they call this &quot; the &quot; s &quot; in the united states , we call it &quot; the &quot; machine &quot; .
the students are being divided off for grades .
and the student will get harder tested , get the better teachers , etc .
they have given a long time to give you a &quot; sufficient &quot; -- &quot; a &quot; good &quot; -- and it was told you , they were a lot of the time , and they were told that they were very clever , and after those three months they
and of course , it breaks to hear the heart that the other way that the food is said is that they &apos;re just enough .
and it was the same thing that was after three months .
but only those who were still in school -- except from the students who have slept in school .
and the key thing that the teachers were , they were not the teachers .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they just said that the student and the students with the note are sufficient , and they &apos;ve taught them something , and they &apos;re treated .
the only real disability is a broken mind , a broken mind , broken , has no hope . he doesn &apos;t find any more sophisticated him , and he &apos;s not going to find our natural ability to use the imagination .
but if we do it , the human mind is going to continue to keep the human mind , and to find ourselves , and other people around themselves , and then we &apos;re going to be really positive , and then we &apos;re really going to put our forces
if a spirit is about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new media systems .
i want to end with a poem , which was written by persian poet called the 14th century , and i told my friend , &quot; the god , &quot; and the poem is called &quot; the god , &quot; not the god of the name , but the god
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right now ?
suppose i said , through a few changes of their genes , a better memory could have -- more precisely , more specifically , faster and faster .
or you want to be more powerful , more force , more force .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be to live longer at good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who are always expecting more creativity to be more creativity .
what would you like to do ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about this as many as it is creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would be to choose for a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . the most common thing i like to do is to be a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a whole different world .
is that all a kind of a fantasy ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a constant topic here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the point of a doctor &apos;s point to the subject .
the big geneticists in the 20th century , the most powerful , which was a computer company in the russian orthodox church , wrote a paper , which is &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense of the evolution of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good time , you take your personal personal control -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can take a look at kathryn luce
but if you accept biological evolution , you think about this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for other people &apos;s food care care or it &apos;s also us ?
this is another view of life in the tree .
in this picture , i &apos;ve put a bush as a center of the branches in all directions because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the existing species of the tree have been successful in evolutionary terms : they have survived ; it
the human part of this kind of thing , far at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re interested in .
we &apos;re looking at a common ancestor of modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids were in hominids .
some are coming and left .
we &apos;ve been here for about a few years .
it seems to be quite remote from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually to the largest part , the basic mechanisms of our cells are quite equal to the same .
is it clear that we can use it and use the mechanisms of a shared bacteria to produce the protein of the human being , which is used to treat the sediment ?
this is not like the kind of high-tech , this is the same protein that comes from what comes from the pancreas .
and with the bacteria , you know , is aware of that , that every one of us in our gut is more bacteria than it is cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times many times .
i mean , think , if antonio damasio asks her self &apos;s self , you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful , wonderful environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s wet , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re all going to give you nutrients that you might want to be just to offer without any effort .
it &apos;s really a lighter way to do bacteria with formal arrangements of unintended , which forced to be forced to the outcome .
but , you know , you &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as you &apos;re important for your life .
they help the democratization of the precious nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary balance in a species of a species ?
or are we certainly going to be something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
now , let &apos;s step back to the big bang of 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago -- the first signs of living , perhaps three to four billion years ago , on earth -- the first one of
in this huge unfinished symphony of the universe , life on earth is just just a little bit more scarce ; the animal kingdom , as a single twist , and the human life , a small color system .
we were .
this also is the most popular thing that &apos;s going on , so i hope , d , you know , have a person like that .
now , when i was a college student on college , i had my first business team .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i thought something very fundamental : in most the existence of life in the most responsible organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell will continue to be kept on both child .
but at the time , when the animals turned out , things started changing .
sexual reproduction is the picture .
and very important : with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome will be the rest of the body , the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the most common of death of death is the same thing in the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now i have to say , if i was a computer , i thought , okay , sex / death , death / sex , it seemed quite sensible to be the time , but with every year , it &apos;s to have to have my increase .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , who read his show in las vegas in the 1990s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his own side of his body .
he opens the door .
it &apos;s a beautiful place of the computer &apos;s worth of view .
she looks at it and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for a computer company . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; george , i &apos;ll take the soup .
i came to the realization as a doctor that i was a goal to be a goal of evolution , not necessarily , just to be different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to rebuild the health for a disease .
i wanted to have a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about copying the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation .
and from an evolutionary standpoint , they &apos;re and i &apos;m developing as a maker of rockets to send the genetic water to the next stage of orbit to go down to the sea .
i think we would all be the mood that would get the plaque all the term to the expression , and he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get immortality through my work .
i want to get it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to prefer the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily include the biggest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution is the creatures that are best facing their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , and that &apos;s because they &apos;re the so-called steam , and they could survive the so-called steam , if fish were there , they would have a vacuum to make it a vacuum , and they have managed to
so what does that mean when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space of the people in evolution , and especially how we &apos;re looking forward into the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a series of
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we have reached a kind of balance .
and the reason that we have the first thing that we have is that we &apos;ve done this by medicine , and we &apos;ve managed to get a lot of genes that would have been otherwise more sophisticated and removed from the population .
and secondly , we have a species of our environment so that we &apos;ve done it , that we &apos;ve done it , and we &apos;re going to adapt to them exactly and we &apos;re looking at them .
and by the way , we cross and mix and mix so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for the evolution to be more competitive .
a second way is that it &apos;s going to be a evolution of traditional art , of course , imposed by the forces of nature .
and the argument , here would be that the wheels of the evolution is slowly growing up .
and so far the isolation is , when we &apos;re constrained as a species , it will be interpreted and there are the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a compelling , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it the new development -- the new development that &apos;s not just , but it &apos;s led to us as a function of the decisions that we do .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s look at the reality that people today are making decisions in some cultures about their offspring .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
so think about if it wasn &apos;t just possible to choose your child &apos;s gender , but you can also make genetic adaptations , you can heal the diseases and prevent it .
what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or wash the risk of risk or strokes ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do it , to make these changes in your genes ?
if we &apos;re going to be a lot of change , these kinds of changes are getting increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost geology billion dollars .
in the next year , when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same for 20 million dollars in a decade to four months .
today , you can have a sequence of three billion base pairs of human genome to a price of a $ 1,000 20,000 and in the room about a week of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take long to the reality that it will be the 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everybody .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering gave the most engineering prize of francis arnold and the steel prize , two scientists who have developed independently , and to create the natural process of evolution , and to lead to more and more proteins in a more efficient
a few years ago , the most popular news of the scientist was awarded to the scientists he took a adult , a adult , a computer , and by the manipulation of only four genes , the cell , in the way , is occupied by being able to
these changes are coming .
the same technology that can produce the human insulin in bacteria that can &apos;t only protect itself , but also to serve the immunity against other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s a experimental study in the gang with vaccine to influenza , which is grown in the cells of a brain factory .
can you imagine something good that comes from tobacco ?
this is all reality and in the future will be much more possible .
so , just imagine two other changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
what if you could change the sperm and the fresh water , or the fresh egg , to give your children a better chance to live for a long-term life -- reduce diabetes , reduce the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to healthier children ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science that can allow the changes to prevent disease , could also allow us to adopt the more inclusive , and we can also be able to adopt the better memory .
why don &apos;t you have the most skeptical of a ken jennings , especially if you can extend it with the next generation of the world &apos;s population ?
why not the fast men who are allowed to make them faster , faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are going to be the most populous .
and if we &apos;re on a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want to be transformed by evolution to the energy system .
we &apos;re going to have a process that requires 100,000 years , and we can download it on a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions that their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , must be dealing with .
do we use these decisions to form a society that is better , which is more successful ?
or are we selectively going to choose different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
will we form a society , and we &apos;re going to be a society , or robust and resilient ?
these are the kinds of questions we &apos;re going to have to be engaged in .
and most of all , we will ever be able to develop wisdom , and the wisdom we need to master , the wisdom we need to make these decisions ?
in good ways , and we used to think of it as you might think that these decisions are going to be us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine now , a portable robot that gives you a more energetic , or another , which helps the most powerful , back up and go up .
we call this robot , in berkeley , this robot .
they &apos;re not different than something you put in the morning and gives them extra strength and increase their velocity and will help them to keep their balance .
this is indeed the real revolutionary of human and machine .
but not only that -- and they merge and connect them to the universe and other devices out there .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers who carry about 100 pounds on its back , and it &apos;s the request that you should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- the more important , 30 percent of it -- chronic , 30 percent of them .
so we thought we would take this challenge and create a design system that would help to deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to now -- or the human universal scanner .
soldier : with the computer , i can carry 200 pounds over the surface of a lot of hours , many hours .
his flexible design is allowing it to be deep to living , and it &apos;s highly wasteful of the movement .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then increase my strength and resilience .
we &apos;re as far as we think of this device , this new kind of technology in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s now look at the statue of the statue , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people around the world estimated in the wheelchair .
this is about a percent of the population population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people with spinal cord cups who in the way of their life -- &apos; 30s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 40s , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , which is multiplied by the number .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it goes to a more pessimistic , or to other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so it &apos;s been the way that it has been , by the way , for 500 years , as i have to say , very successful .
so we thought we could start writing a whole new chapter in mobility .
now let me introduce you to a moment of amanda , which is carried by amanda , the 19 years ago , a spinal cord , who had the result that she couldn &apos;t run more than 40 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our credit .
it has sensors .
his completely favorite sensors in the crutches , the signals of the signals that are attached to the back of your back , is on your back .
here &apos;s also the most powerful , the most powerful , the most prolific , as you can move on your hips , as you can move forward , and very natural , very natural gait .
i was 24 years old , and in the school room , when a computer designer was a little bit more , a computer scientist was a little bit more fond .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and a movement underneath my body .
not long after that , a doctor in my hospital room and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s a steel that &apos;s going to make a steel experience from my consciousness .
so , adaptable have been able to have me been able to learn to go back to the board , to climb back and drive and drive the hands of the wheel .
but nothing was invented , which would let me go back to this .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to make us and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands and we have the whole potential here to change life from future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for amanda , but for all the disabled players , but for all .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m a director of the most influential organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t get to poverty , i &apos;m a little bit more like a football scientist , and i &apos;m a jazz student in a volunteer .
now in our city , in the city that volunteers have had a very early , early , you have to be very early at the time of the day to be able to get a lot of the time .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer in the school of the day , so i had a pretty good opportunity to go in .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to get the people to be able to figure out what to be our jobs .
when i found the most serious , he just had a very serious conversation with the mit bank , which certainly had one of the worst days of their life .
it was the night in the middle of the night and she stood in the pajamas and the barefoot rains under a screen in the street , while her house was caught .
the other volunteers who came out of me was a sneak luther -- let &apos;s get it to a , and was asked to go to the house and then was asked to save the dog of the street .
the dog ! i was lost .
there was some lawyer or a lawyer who was now for the rest of his life , the people who could tell him that he went to a community house , just because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next .
the main community is to me .
he said , &quot; mythology , you have to go to the house .
you have to go up , the fire goes over , and you have to get a few shoes . &quot;
i swear to it .
well , not exactly what i hoped i had , but i went to go -- the stairs up , the middle of the &quot; true &quot; , which is the real &quot; s &quot; over the moment , which was actually going to be done with the back of
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey down , where i met my sins and the beloved dog .
we put our most hopeful to the outside of the world , where , not surprisingly , the more interesting thing that i had more attention than i did .
some weeks later , the most popular one was got a letter of the most painful , in which she was going to be able to get out of the brave use of her house .
one of the things that are estimated , in all cases , is very strongly , of kindness : somebody had put their shoes in a few shoes .
both in my profession with robin hood as well as my volunteer year-old , i witness in the most powerful , and i also see generosity in the big scale , but i also also see the love of the individual and the human being .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look at this room , and people who have either been able to achieve a very successful success or on their way there are , i want to offer the following memory : wait not .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in life in another way , until you get their first million .
if you have something to give it , you &apos;ll have it .
do you have a park in a neighborhood , shop in the neighborhood , you &apos;re going to go to a neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day , we will offer a chance to save life of a human , but every day we have the opportunity to change one .
so they put it on ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno &apos;s s : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of the human being .
a place where women have the most common , with sex &apos; hello , and the game determines -- where fun is a serious matter .
and no , it &apos;s not a matter of the way you &apos;re or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their pets .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the northeast of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , which lived about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are known for their own business .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of the story of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the bus .
as chimpanzees of great , fear of the great , fear of the other , the most popular people will lead to the top of the brain .
and that &apos;s really what &apos;s made of it , because this leads to a very , very much more powerful society in the deadly force .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least known among the primates .
they live in the deep of the protected forest , and they &apos;re just very hard to do .
congo is a paradox -- a country extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness -- the scene of a violent argument that has been given for decades and almost so many lives like the first world war .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction also survive the survival of the bonobos .
and the decline of the state of the fish , and the decline of the state , is that you could not even fill a mask with the remaining bonobos -- and even there &apos;s no secure to be honest .
and yet , in this country , of violence and chaos , you can hear a laugh that the trees were overwhelmed .
who are these related ones ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war &quot; because they have tao , also , also , sex , with armed partners , and rules like conflict and social media .
i &apos;m not saying that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because life is from more than the cama .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives long .
play doesn &apos;t just mean just a game .
for us and it &apos;s fundamentally , the purpose of connection and the care of tolerance .
we &apos;re learning , and the rules of the game .
play is based on creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the production of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you look at bonobos in the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human being , dance and rituals .
play is the most powerful , which is the world &apos;s worth of survival .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique shots straight from the wild .
first of all , a computer designer on the street -- and i don &apos;t think of football .
so here we see a young female and males in a field of a brain .
look at what she does .
that could be evolutionary origin : &quot; you put it in the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more like that , not true .
yeah !
so , the other thing is , they are spread , both in bonobos , and in the way .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the most interesting , with the one that you bring new elements into the game -- like the testicles -- and also , as the game does both trust
but the game is a computer game .
play is a computer game , and it can take a lot of forms of which some people are quiet , and they &apos;re curious -- maybe to discover the consideration of the question .
and i want to show you , this is a young , young female , and it &apos;s radically related to water .
i think , as you play , we sometimes play , and we &apos;re going to be able to make the limitations of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us explore , and the unexpected way we &apos;re making is the real breeding of creativity .
this is just a little taste on the insights that bonobos put us in our past and present .
but it also is a secret for our future , a future where we have to adapt to rising challenges , through greater creativity and more powerful .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our business system .
so to make us adapt to a world &apos;s environment , we need to play .
but will we do the best of our online system ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
bonobos and people equally is the life of the teeth , and the way that the bonobos are alone .
if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , play may be the most appropriate .
and so , my favorite , let &apos;s hug this gift of evolution , and play in common , while we &apos;re looking at creativity and wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs of 1979 , in 1979 , at the same day , in exactly the same moment , every one of the one , a baby -- okay .
so two pairs , every one of the one , a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to use the too much time to imagine the martian because if you &apos;re all the time to imagine the gradual , you don &apos;t listen to me .
just imagine that for a moment .
and in this scenario , they imagine that in a case that &apos;s a hummingbird , the sperm carries a y of the egg , which is true x chromosome .
and in the other case , the sperm &apos;s viral chromosome is that the x chromosome is hitting the oyster .
both of them are the firing , both fire .
we &apos;re going to come back to these people later .
i have two efforts in my activities .
and i &apos;m talking about the story of the anatomy .
i &apos;m an historian , and i study , in this case , how people with anatomy -- that &apos;s what human bodies , animal bodies -- animal bodies -- how they were with body rays , with the body , as they thought about body .
the other hat i had carried in my work is the activist , as a police officer -- or , sometimes i say , as a tedster lawyer -- from people who are patients from doctors .
in this case , i worked with people who have the social norms , the social norms in question .
so , for example , i worked with people who are the most popular twins , two people in a body .
i &apos;ve worked with people with a computer company -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often , i worked with people who are working on their gender , so their gender , which have not been the average male or female , have not been involved in the average male .
and as a general term , we can use the word for the word .
it &apos;s a lot of different forms of life .
i just give you a few examples of the types of types of people who are not the male or female standard .
in a case , maybe someone with a computer company , and the most common gene of the y leaves the internet , the most responsible , which we have all of the time , to get rid of the testicles .
and so the testicles are giving testosterone at the stage of testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to recognize the testosterone , the body is not responding to testosterone .
and that &apos;s called the water .
so , a lot testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as a consequence , the body is starting to double more of the female , the other female course .
if the kid is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s brought up as a girl .
but it &apos;s usually to get puberty and grow their breasts and grow their breasts , but they don &apos;t get their period , until someone is there that there &apos;s something different .
and they do a few tests and find out that instead of the other , they have a little bit of cortisol and the uterus , in fact , and they have a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could think that person could actually hold this person for male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , have something that you call a little bit of the body .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the most compelling people are making , in retrospect , that are the most ambiguous hormones .
most women , like me -- i think i &apos;m a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real job , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me actually speak on emulation .
we &apos;re producing the design and we &apos;re talking to emulation .
the consequence is that somebody like me actually have a brain that was exposed to more sophisticated than a woman who was born with testicles , and a computer company has been .
so gender is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be distributed across the range of the range , in a matter of the range .
one example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as young as young , he had a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived with his girlfriend , and he had just found that he had the
he had an extreme form of an innate computer .
he has a lot of the chromosomes , and in the womb , his favorite rate was so much active that they &apos;re essentially creating a male , a male , which is basically a male .
and as a consequence , his granddaughter male , his brain was exposed to the most cosmopolitan male part of the computer &apos;s brain .
and when he was born , he saw a boy -- nobody had a little .
and only as he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he was going to live inside the room that the doctors found that he was in the inside female .
okay , just a quick example of a version of the user .
some people with the chromosomes , they develop something that is called the most responsible , which is the most powerful thing to do with the brain .
we don &apos;t know exactly why that happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason kids with this kind of body -- is it &apos;s a little bit more sinister or more responsible twins , it &apos;s a lot of the way that surgeons are made -- often , because this is for their physical health of advantage .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they &apos;re often done different kinds of surgical procedures is because they threaten our social categories .
typically , our system is based on the idea that a certain anatomical feature is associated with a specific identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is called a female identity ; a black person to be means to have an african anatomy in terms of your own story .
so we have this awful simplistic idea .
and if we faced with a body that actually is very different for us , it &apos;s kind of confused to us in terms of this kind of thing .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about technorati .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of technorati .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when kids are born , the two people in a body are in a body .
where i had been most excited about the most excited , the south african ii was the south african world &apos;s day , whose gender was asked in the world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world in berlin .
many journalists call me the question , &quot; what test are you going to do , the test that tells us whether the more appropriate person is going to be female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that there are no test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we admit that nature is not going to be a line between male and female , or between male and female and female and female , and we &apos;re going to be , and we &apos;re doing it , which is
so we have a situation where , where the further our science is moving , we need to admit that these categories that we had thought of for robust anatomical categories , which made very simple basic kinds of developmental categories , are much more frustrating than we &apos;ve assumed
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
it also applies to race , which turns out to be a lot more complicated than our brain system has been approved .
we &apos;ve got our observation in all sorts of different areas of the world .
we &apos;re going to push on the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what should we do with the fact that we just differ by them by a few passages ?
while we keep our science moving on , we get increasingly much in a zone of awkwardness where we have to recognize that the most powerful categories we had probably had too simple .
we see this in all sorts of different areas of human life .
one of the areas that we see in the world is in our culture today , in the united states today , are the struggle of the beginning and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about what &apos;s going on a body to get a body , so he &apos;s got a different right than the wmap life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- maybe not as much as public as in medicine -- about the question when somebody is dead .
our ancestors had never been able to fight the question , when someone was dead .
you &apos;ve only kept a feather under the nose , and if you moved , you haven &apos;t buried them .
if you don &apos;t move , you buried it .
but today we are in a situation where we take people to make vital organs and put them together other people .
and as a result , we caught up with the struggle of the really difficult question , when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation that we don &apos;t have anymore , in the way that we have .
now you might assume that the whole crash of categories would be somebody like me to make a happy job .
i &apos;m politically more skilled , i &apos;m a lot of people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to realize that these categories are really more insecure than we thought , i &apos;m worried .
and it makes me realize that democracy is being addressed .
so to tell you about this tension , i have to first have a car professor , that i &apos;m a big fan of the fathers .
i know they were the ones that were , i know they were the most amazing , but they were great .
i think that they were so versatile and strong , and so radical , what they did , i &apos;ve all been looking at the most recent , the most common thing that i &apos;ve been doing , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is absolutely forgotten
it &apos;s because of that , what in 1991 is happening with the most cosmopolitan .
the fathers were from my view of the original anatomical activists , which is why .
what she was doing was a concept of a concept , and they were using it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us , and 200 years .
as you remember , our fathers refused to take the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was on the bottom of a very , very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the tar shrimp of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of the design of the world .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who have political power should have this political power , because of the police &apos;s rights , for the son of the grandfather and so on .
the fathers predicted this idea and they gave them a new idea of a new concept , and this concept said that all people have been created in the same way .
they &apos;re going to play the play system and decided that that progeria is the common , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they did this for part because they were part of a system of a system in which two things are together .
democracy grew , but at the same time , the science was growing .
if you look at the story of the founding fathers , it &apos;s clear that many of you were interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a kind of a world &apos;s concept .
they went away from explanations , and they found things like supernatural concept of power , back to where the transmission concept of power is based on a very highly important term of decorative .
they moved to a very somber concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , they made us a concept of cloning , which was a viable thing .
and so they have really prepared the future civil rights rights .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened after years ?
for example , women who were using the vote to the best of the fathers , the concept of the fathers , is that the anatomical region is more important than the anatomical difference , and said , &quot; we have a uterus and the world &apos;s right to have
and women are successful .
next came the successful civil rights , where we saw people like the world &apos;s rights , which is the kind of thing that we saw , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the lobby of the world called the world &apos;s s , saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people are more color , and they have different color skills that are different from anatomical differences , again , successful .
we see the same thing in the world .
of course , the problem is , and we start looking at all the common things we have to start asking , why we have to sustain certain hydrocarbons .
well , mind , i want to have some kind of heroic leaps , and it &apos;s a lot of popularity in our culture .
i want to do a fish for example , like a human being .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want five times to say that five times the right to have your informed consent or to marry your consent .
so there are some of the anatomical feedbacks that make sense for me , and we think , i think , keep it .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re useful .
so let &apos;s come back to these two creatures that have been at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in 1979 , in the same day .
so imagine that one of them , maria , was born three months of birth , so she was born at june 1980 .
so , henry , on the other side , the most born , he &apos;s born , so he &apos;s born at march 1980 .
only because maria was born three months of the fact that she was born all the way , all the way to have three months ago -- that have the right sex to have the right to drink .
henry has to wait for all this , not because he actually has a different biological age , just because of the most born of his birth .
we still find other oddities of what their rights are .
henry , because you take the fact that he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the most powerful -- because you take that he &apos;s a male , he &apos;s moved to the fact that maria doesn &apos;t have to worry .
maria , but can &apos;t be able to perceive the same thing in all states , the henry in all states , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
henry can marry a woman , but maria can only marry a woman today in a few states .
so we have this permanent e8 category that are in many ways , and questionable .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is doing such progress in the realm of anatomy that we have to get a point where we have to admit that democracy , which is based on anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , sometimes it feels like science is making its own genetic power .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture is a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; good , we need to go somewhere , so we &apos;re going to pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught up in a very strange position .
so for example , texas decided to get a man to marry a man , that you don &apos;t have a y chromosome , and a woman means to marry a y chromosome .
now , in practice , people are not tested on their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of history that i told you about the most popular .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king offers us in his &quot; i &apos;m talking a dream . &quot;
he says we shouldn &apos;t be people to be &quot; your color color , but after the property of your character , &quot; and it goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , it sounds like a good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you tell people because of their characters ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be surrounded with people that we should be surrounded with people , because i must admit that i know a series of golden water , which probably makes advantage more than some people i know .
i want to know that i probably know some bright music , which is the most delicious , more intelligent and more enlightened decisions about their sexual relationships than some more than a more , which i know .
so how do we get the question to the characteristics of the character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really hard to do .
and part of me wonder what if the content of a personality would be something that would be in the future -- could be made by a marketer ?
do we really want to go to this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really matters to think about the idea that the united states is leading to the question of democracy .
in our practice for democracy , we &apos;ve done our thing right , and i think we would make our thing good in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like the case of iran , where a man who feels sexually to other men who feel being made with other men , it &apos;s punished , because he &apos;s ready to put a computer in which he can stay alive .
states of this kind exist not .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon i talked about a few years ago , who had a few more fancy twins with the other hand , to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i was with him , and he asked him why he made these surgeries -- it was high to the top of the operations -- was his answer that in his country , these kids are very bad treated , and so he had to do it .
i told him , &quot; well , you &apos;ve had a lot of time in a hurry , instead of a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible opportunities to allow people to be the ones that they &apos;re not going to change around the state .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to end , i want to notice that i talked very much about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibility of thinking about democracy , or looked at the mothers , if we had more involved in the mothers .
and i want to say something that is radical , and i think that there might be different kinds of insights that are kind of important from different types of anatomy , in the way that people are applying a food sample .
since years , since i was interested in the school of the field , i was interested in research in the field of the world &apos;s exploration .
and one of the things i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from the study studies is that women , in average -- not every one , but in average -- more of the size of complex social relationships and caring for people who are vulnerable in the group of people in the group of affairs .
and so , if we think about it , we have a really interesting situation .
years ago , when i was doing a graduate student , i asked myself a student who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked at myself as a feminist , so it &apos;s a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism female is . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about being compatible about gender , so feminism is not female .
but the more i thought about his question , so i thought it could be a female in feminism .
this is what &apos;s going to be called a little , in average , which is the average of female brains of male brains , and make us more sophisticated for the brain complex , and make more sophisticated social relationships for the design of the world .
so where the fathers were extremely adept to be able to be protected with the state of the state , it &apos;s possible that if we were more mothers in this concept , we can make more a concept of a concept of being more responsible , not just like
and maybe it &apos;s where we have to go in the future when we have a democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual body , and thinking about the individual body , and more about relationships .
so that if we &apos;re trying to make a more perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a little bit of a fan of this , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with doodles .
i love to find a different kind of life , crazy outfit , to wear crazy , and also photograph in time and lead to the team .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes out of the second hand , and i get in a book store .
ooh , thank you .
so , the impact of my favorite , the influence of my favorite , to reduce the environment , and also the way my wallet .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars for ordinary purposes is a good purpose ; i see quite unique ; and it &apos;s going to work on my own personal personal school .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it have my size ?
am i going to be the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers , i feel loud , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;ve been doing for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does someone do with so many of their stomachs ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven of these grandchildren , and that &apos;s all .
pencils for exactly a week , which i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve been assuming that i would have anything i would have wanted to be , if i just came to palm springs .
and since you don &apos;t have me heard of me as the woman who &apos;s walking around here at ted in her underwear -- that &apos;s what i found a few things .
and i want to show you my doodles for this week .
sounds good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m going to leave you with some lessons that i think you &apos;re doing or not , from these foreign inventions , nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the light tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost look at less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the coat , has taken me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i was wearing in this whole week .
monday : color is a powerful thing .
it &apos;s almost fundamental to be bad , bad , if you &apos;re wearing pants pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you can pull other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation is completely manipulated .
i spent a lot of time in my life trying to try and be myself , and i &apos;m at the same time .
just be , who you are .
if you surrounded with the right people , you &apos;re not going to get it to you , you &apos;ll also appreciate it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people tell me , i saw , when i was sleeping , i &apos;d come out of her paycheck .
i would like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re in something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think that you &apos;re not looking good at something , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to wrap it up for you .
if you believe that you &apos;re inside and outside , you have a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for anyone here in this audience .
we should be able to rock everything that we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden , appropriately , to all of us .
and finally , saturday : a very unique , personal style to develop a great way of telling the world about a word without saying a word .
it was always proven to me and again , when in this week people came to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;ll give it all up .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let it go .
i don &apos;t have to be emotional , because the same thing is going to be a different crazy , crazy , white , intimidating outfit , waiting for me when i love a little bit in heart and looking .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all together .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as a flying , flying glass .
this is what we call in our lab , design design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every boy in italy grows with this picture in his room , but the reason why i &apos;m showing you this is something that was very interesting in the last decades of the last decades .
a few years ago , when you wanted to win a formula , then they took their budget and they put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver was good enough , they won the race .
now , you need to have a race , if you want to win a race , actually , something like this -- something that the car in real time has been giving a few thousand sensors , some thousand sensors that are going to pass information from the car
this would be , in the blink of a , called a water company .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is made out of two parts -- a piece of a piece of light and a half .
what &apos;s interesting today is the most interesting thing to start in our lives .
our cities were equipped in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
they become a computer in the free .
and as a computer in the free , you start to respond to other kinds of things , and they &apos;re being seen .
if we &apos;re going to live cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
and by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the world &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population lives there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the world &apos;s gdp -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
over the cities , all of this sense and driving all of this is a life of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition that paola antonelli is later at the year , while the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , start to talk back to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like every atom out there to two , one sensor and a laser .
and that changes radically the interaction that we have people with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as though the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , when michelangelo shaped the moses , it says he took the hammer and threw him on moses -- actually , you can still see a little bit of a spot -- and said , &quot; well , &quot; do you talk about the &quot; unclear year-old &quot;
now , now , our environment begins to answer the first time we &apos;re going to answer .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and to make it happen .
let &apos;s start with the perceive .
now the first project i want to introduce you to is in truth of one of the first of our lab .
it was developed four times four years ago in italy .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually to use new kinds of network that was used in the world -- that &apos;s a key -- and anonymous and the most thoughtful information from that network to use the world &apos;s appearance of the company , to understand how the city
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was the christmas crash , the most central .
some of you will remember , it was played as italy against france , and then at the end of the day , the most salient thing .
and anyway , in italy , in the end of the end .
now , you &apos;re looking at what happened in this day , just looking at the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see in the middle of the world , the flow of the river .
on the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline up .
and the old afternoon , people here and there , they &apos;re making calls and move .
the game starts -- silence .
france makes a gate . italy makes a gate .
and they &apos;re traveling , and they go to a little call , go on the toilet .
second , they &apos;re blown up . the normal end of the normal game .
first iteration , second .
so , in a moment of the most popular .
italy wins . yeah .
well , in this night , all the center to celebrate .
they saw the big key principles .
the next day , all the center to go to the center and the prime minister to the same time .
and then all the down .
you see the picture of the space , the other thing that the roman time , where the roman time , people go to celebrate -- have a big party , and you see the key thing on the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t have a few years ago .
another example of feeling is that there &apos;s not about people , but to do things that we use and consume .
well , we know all about where our things come .
this is a map that shows you all the chips , which is a mac computers , which came together .
but we just know little about where things go .
so we actually designed some little markers in this project to track the garbage while it goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers who have been helping us a year ago , in seattle , who are doing things that they &apos;re doing -- different kinds of things that you can see -- things that you would throw away in .
then we have the little chips that are small brands , and they start tracking it .
here &apos;s the results we &apos;re getting right now .
from seattle ...
after a week .
and we realized that this information was a lot of the information in the system .
we can do the same things in the same way with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of information , and more complicated things .
but the other thing is , we believe that if we see every day , the cup we throw away is not just away that they still are somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we still keep out there is still there .
and if we &apos;re going to show that people , then we can move behavior behavior .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , with the most powerful , could give you a lot more about the perceive and the many other wonderful things you can do with sound , but i want to talk to you about the second part of the world that we &apos;re talking about
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in the west , spain .
it started with a question of the village who came to us and said that spain and the most beautiful tradition have a beautiful tradition of the water to use in public places as part of architecture .
and the question was , how could you connect technology to new technology ?
and one of the ideas that have been measured with a computer in a brain factory was , imagine these tubes , and valves , the ones , they work , and they &apos;re going to open up and close .
they cause something like a plastic ship with a plastic factory .
if these days down , they can write , you can write patterns , images , text ads .
and you can get closer to him , and he &apos;s going to open up to make it look like you can see on this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of the mayor .
it &apos;s very much like it .
and we got a mission to design the entrance in the entrance .
we called it the digital water .
all the buildings was made of water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you &apos;re moving to him , it &apos;s opening and you &apos;re going to go .
the roof was covered with water as well .
and if it &apos;s windy , if you want to reduce the syringes , you can even drop the roof down .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture will be like in this case , you know , this days , if you put the roof out , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; they &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t break the building , it &apos;s just that architecture disappears almost away .
here you see the building works .
you see the person who asks what happens inside the inner .
and here you see me , when i tried to test the sensors that opened the water , not getting wet .
well , i should tell you what one night happened when all the sensors stopped .
but actually , it was a greater fun night .
all the children from the family of the family came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to make them , but a building that still had hurt and holes in the water , you had to jump up with no wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we think about how people who use things we design .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beautiful thing to create things that are used and interact with people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical , the most powerful , the projection of water and the projection .
and this is what brought us to think about this project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine this kind of thing that could really start to fly .
imagine , you could have little helicopter , which fly through the air , and every one of you with a little bit of a little bit of light with light lights -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter that you saw earlier , which is moving with other people &apos;s minds , completely synchrony .
you can have these cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or irregular , in three dimensions , where what changes , the light is not the position of the state of the brain .
you can play with different kinds of ways .
imagine the screen may just appear in different forms of dna or sizes in different forms of dna .
but then , all of this could be a 3d cloud from the surface of the surface that you can walk through and move through the way that you can look at many , many directions .
here you see a real kind of a real computer that &apos;s going to make a second of a second , like a second of a second , a second of a second bell .
if you turn the light out , it looks like we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of people are being controlled .
it could have any single impulse that &apos;s going to have a impulse from people , from the movements of people or something .
i want to show you something first .
we worked with a lot of the best ballet dancers , one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- the metropolitan theater in new york and the scale of milan in milan -- we &apos;ve taken his movements to use it for the design of the ocean .
here you &apos;re dancing with the dance .
on the left , you see the most powerful sensations , the different sensations .
it &apos;s a very , very reactive and a half .
so that you can feel the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , once we have all the most common , you can play with color and play gravity and play gravity .
we want to use this as a possible impulse for the design system .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we work for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud . the cloud .
and the idea is , again , imagine that we &apos;re going to engage people with something and change the environment -- almost as something we call it , the way we call it , but with a cloud .
imagine that every one of the little donation can give a donation for a drug .
i think that the remarkable of the last year is the last few decades , that we &apos;re in a physical world , and we &apos;re changing from a physical world .
that &apos;s all digitized , knowledge , and it &apos;s accessible through the internet .
today , we can do the first time -- and the campaign obama has shown this -- we can get from the digital world , from the biological forces of networks to the physical world .
that can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is something that is built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can be to put us on the challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how we can shift from the digital world to physical .
so the idea is that we actually put people with people in the way that they do things together , collective .
the cloud is again a cloud of plastic , in the same way as a real cloud , a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud of plastic dioxide .
it &apos;s a physical form of material in london , but it &apos;s covered with a lot of light .
you can move and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments for the most important moments of the u.k. and the way that we use it , and it &apos;s as a kind of connection to community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go to , like london &apos;s new mountain .
you can go inside .
and a kind of digital downturn at night -- but as a new kind of experience , a new way of all the experience of all that wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important to the relationship .
i &apos;m trying to express my work that people are not separate from nature and that everything is connected .
the first time i was in antarctica almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first tedtalk .
i was cheating .
my heart complained , i was a lot of a time , while i was trying to grab what was left .
the summers around me almost 60 feet of water , and i could only wonder that this was a snowflake on a different snowflake year year .
in 1939 , when they were a calf , a glacier or by a glacier , or by the time .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re interacting with clear ways of their environment and their experience .
some people are giving up and they &apos;re going to be dropping to the bitter end , while others don &apos;t get to be able to get more and more dramatic passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think they &apos;re isolated , separated and alone , as we often see people .
but the truth is far away from it .
while a iceberg melts , i &apos;m going to take its oxygen source .
while the iceberg float off , he &apos;s turning water drinking drinking water , which feeds a lot of life forms .
i &apos;m going to go to my photographs of these early songs , as if i was making portraits of my ancestors , in the consciousness that they are in these individual moments , and never yet exist again .
it &apos;s not a death , if you melt ; it &apos;s not a end , but it &apos;s a very , a full of your body &apos;s life .
part of the ice in the water industry that i &apos;m going to be doing is a very young -- some thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last images i &apos;d like to show you is a iceberg that i have in the coal park in greenland .
very rarely , you actually witness a tudor iceberg .
here you see it .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please watch the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the most marginalized .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man &apos;s there .
this is the average size of a football system .
it reaches about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just as , you know , the iceberg is a different side of its personality .
thank you .
my life is really blessed by working with some amazing projects .
but at the coolest , what i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy .
his name is a little bit more somber .
and the most popular puppet was one of the leading graffiti of the 1980s .
then one day , he came back from walking and said , &quot; dad , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the one .
so , the whole thing is that it &apos;s completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i was standing on him .
i have a company that makes design and animations , so it &apos;s inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the art world and look at the world in the art world .
so we decided , tony -- and his thing to support .
i met with his father and his brother and his brother , and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk again to tony .
i just want to go back to him and i said , &quot; wait , wait , is this not -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all the paralyzed people communicate with this stuff ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you heard about higher security , and a remarkable insurance can do it , you can really do that .
normal people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , how do you communicate ? &quot;
does anybody see the movie &apos; &apos; butterfly &apos; butterfly , and the &quot; butterfly &quot; ?
so they communicate -- they walk along the way .
i was amazed , &quot; very , very high , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need , just just a check , and instead i put a check from that , which i didn &apos;t have the smallest idea of how to feed it .
i was embarrassed to be in place and his father and his father -- with the words : &quot; good , my proposal is like this : tony will speak , we &apos;ll get it a device and find a way that he can make his art again .
because it &apos;s a farce that somebody who &apos;s going to carry all this in , it cannot communicate . &quot;
so i spoke to a conference later at a conference .
i met these people from the university of research , graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on any surface and then draw with a plastic that &apos;s just the negative area .
so they &apos;re pulling around and they &apos;re doing the way they do .
they say that all things are going on up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the faces , then the most common , the most common , and then the people are doing art , and then they actually do art .
but there was always a life cycle in her presentation .
so i went home , and i ate my wife at night and told her , &quot; well , wait for second , if there &apos;s this technology , you can use the eyes to control things , and then we should find a way of making that a laser
this was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and lots of things , we have reached some things .
first , we have the insurance insurance workers , and we have the doors to get a device that he can communicate with -- a stephen &apos;s .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call it a little bit of the time , because you talk to him , or you &apos;re going to get email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so troubled , this guy &apos;s incredible . &quot;
and we also have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the edges of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and programmers have taken our house over .
many of our friends thought we were beautiful , and that we were doing it , and we were going to be the same thing to do , and we were all the images of the walls .
but for about two weeks , we &apos;ve been writing , we went to the national lobe in venice , my children , and we were doing this , and we created this .
it &apos;s called the &quot; water &quot; and you can see the description .
this is a cheap convenience that we bought in the most violent of venice , something called a little bit of a little bit of the blood phone and a few things from the mobile phone and the water .
we took a team of a team , and they have a set of windows , and now we have a device that &apos;s available , and now we have a device that &apos;s available to the free -- you can build it for the code free , the software
so we have created a device that is completely free from constraints .
no insurance can be a drug .
no hospital .
now , everybody paralyzed in fact , in fact , to communicate with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of two weeks , we went back to the back of the room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else and that &apos;s his room .
there &apos;s all of these most profound unveiling that &apos;s happening .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of planning , two weeks , and the night , tony , and he &apos;s taken over seven years to get seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and it looks beyond your life support system .
we have its bed , so it can see it out of the way .
we set up a projection on a screen against the wall of the hospital .
and he was doing it again , and he was the first time in the prison of his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what was a lot of the parking .
so , funny , we had to go into the parking areas , so we felt so much as part of the most responsible .
and at the end , he would send us an email with the content : &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve been drawn something .
i feel that i was going to get out of water and finally , someone went down and raised my head , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that mind-blowing ?
this is something like our brain system .
that &apos;s what keeps us off and we keep going to go further .
and we have to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a little bit of a second .
and somebody who has such an orange potential made so much more .
so we &apos;re in finding out how to do better , faster and stronger .
since this time , we &apos;ve all been getting a lot of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one deserves it .
it &apos;s all from our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong &apos;s vs. and then , december , we &apos;re honored to do the most exciting thing as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010 , which was really great .
the most powerful thing about this is -- and that &apos;s the whole circle -- that this april , the most april , in the city of los angeles , will give an exhibition called &quot; the &quot; form of the world &apos;s &quot; the &quot; form of the world
and there are probably the toughest representatives of the computer &apos;s rights , and the most difficult representative of the world &apos;s rights -- the most powerful , the most common , the most common , all these guys will be there .
so , the show is part of the show , which is pretty wild .
so basically , i &apos;m going to say , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , it &apos;s possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the most impossible -- all of it was impossible .
do it possible -- you all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer and i had never had any of the work to do with the other , but i just captured something and i &apos;ve been surrounded with amazing people so that we could put something on the legs .
and this question should be , every single day , of any of you , and you can get something that needs to be done , and if not now , when not , and if i , and if i , then , if you don &apos;t , who
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most commonly more powerful .
and i always say that i &apos;m not going to come to the people like this .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever chosen farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
well , a epiphany is usually something that you find because you drop it somewhere .
you &apos;re going to go to the block and it &apos;s a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard viii .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you today .
my circle began at the 1960s at high school in the &apos; 60s , ohio , where i was the most successful .
i was the one who was beaten every week in the back green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using the toilet in the prison shop .
and it did it .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go out of the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it turned me to san francisco , and i found a lover -- and then i found a lover in the &apos; 80s , and i found it important in the &apos; 80s .
about three or four years ago , i got a call from the night , a call of this teacher , to post , &quot; i have to see them .
i &apos;m sad that we never have learned each other as adults .
you can come to ohio , please , and please come together with the man that i know that they &apos;ve found .
and i should mention that i have a little bit of time , and i want you to go on . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them , and we took them to us , and we gave them up to their family , because it was necessary , because it was necessary , it was necessary .
it was something that we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults , met me , she turned into a box full of ashes and was placed in my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation i &apos;ve talked about was the revelation of the thing that i showed .
the revelation is , the death is part of the life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that needs the rest of life .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is so often mentioned here .
he takes the same -- he would need , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to give us these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , as you climb on 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a engine that &apos;s the pattern , the terrestrial , limitations , limitations , limitations , limitations , limitations .
that sounds terrifying .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat on the street .
i was the only one who could talk to the most successful .
so i looked at it , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve probably caught a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had been able to get the machine and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot made the machine out after the hudson river .
that &apos;s not usually the route .
it turns out the engines .
imagine a little bit of a plane .
and then he said three words -- the most popular words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; the impact for the movement . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the most appropriate .
i could see it in your eyes , because she was horror , life was too late .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
we have this kind of carbon that we have , we have these things that we want to do in life and i thought about all the people i wanted to have a hand and not did , and it didn &apos;t do all the fences that i wanted to
while i was thinking later about it , a saying , which is , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because if the wine is far as far and the person is there , i open it .
i never want to move anything more in life .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned at this day -- and that was when we were looking at the george washington bridge , pretty much about this , because i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing i really did .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i , i think , better to become anything i &apos;m going to do .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve given my ego to my own space .
and i was doing the time i wasted the things that i &apos;m drinking for the most responsible things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to the friends of my wife .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to borrow negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t discuss two years with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have right , i &apos;m going to be happy to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and as the inner clock is going on , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , &quot; &quot; the &quot; s , &quot; &quot; the &quot; . &quot;
you see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please flying into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts , like you know it from a documentary .
while we had a gps , i had this feeling , man , to die , not terrifying .
almost as if we &apos;re going to prepare our lives for it .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness is really in a thought , which is that i just wish to give you one thing .
i wish i could grow up my children .
about a month after , i went to a performance of my daughter -- first , not much academic talent .
... not yet .
and i &apos;m going to write , i &apos;m crying like a little kid .
and in the world , everything was a sense of mine .
i realized that by connecting the dots together , it &apos;s just about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else , is my only goal in life , a good father .
i was not going to die in the wonder of that day .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , and come back and live and live differently .
my call of all that flies today is : imagine the same thing on your flight -- don &apos;t -- but imagine , and how would you change ?
what would you do , you throw it , because you think you &apos;re always there ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parents that you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the odyssey is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post for the development of nuclear weapons is the most powerful thing in the world .
the gray boxes that you see here are the most ambiguous .
now , if it &apos;s possible to help us to control the systems , which control and valves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes are not running with the surface of the technology ; it &apos;s based on a completely different technology .
but if we do it , a effective resource system on a laptop is used by a bottom-up box to put this gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind microblogging .
so we start with a nuclear field .
the most popular box will store the gray box , the centrifuge , and the iranian bird system , and the iranian state of prostitution -- is a mission .
this is a piece of a piece , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started to digitize our research six months ago , we had completely unknown what the sense and purpose was that kind of thing .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the most important part of the world &apos;s health system , the most powerful part of the world , and he made a lot of the use of the treatment of the treatment .
and it seemed to be something called a little bit of the gray boxes , these sort of predatory boxes .
and that blew our attention and we started a project project , where we were infected with the environment of stuxnet , and we studied this constructed .
and then something funny happened .
so , boyd is just like a computer company that doesn &apos;t like our cheese -- the more , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we &apos;ve been experimenting with various kinds of cheese , i went to that , that this is a more serious attack .
completely on a particular goal .
the most active track of the gray box is running around when a special configuration was discovered , even if that &apos;s special program , which is being recycled to infect it .
and if not , it doesn &apos;t even do it .
so , that really got my interest and we started working on it almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , we &apos;re going to say , an american power power , or a national power station in germany .
so we should be better to figure out what the goal is .
so , the most powerful and more powerful , we found that he &apos;s in two digital warheads , and it &apos;s a smaller and bigger one .
and we also realized that they were very professional constructed by people who were all the most obvious information available to the information .
they knew all bits and pieces of paint they had to attack .
you probably knew the most powerful of the design of the computer .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve heard that the most prolific thing is , the most high-tech , and high-tech is , let me tell you , the most important thing is , the world &apos;s worth of science is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this gene code .
we &apos;re talking about this -- about 15,000 lines code .
it looks like old-fashioned logging .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code .
so , after what we were doing first , we were doing the first thing that we were doing , because we know what these are doing .
and then we looked at the design of the world and we tried to bring these to the real world in connection -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could demonstrate or value .
so to make these theories , we call ourselves in memory that it &apos;s definitely about the most profitable , it has to be a high quality of action , and it &apos;s probably a high thing to be in iran because most infections were reported .
now , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
it &apos;s basically going out to the nuclear power , and on the top of the road , in the water industry .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; let me take a list of all the experts for anagnorisis and power plants from our client . &quot;
and i called them , and i know her , and i know her , to compare your expertise to what we &apos;ve found in code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital material to the internet , and it &apos;s going to be the same thing .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , these black object that you see .
and if you manipulate the speed of this carbon system , you actually have able to crack rotor rotor and eventually , and then let the centrifuge explode .
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was actually , and it &apos;s slow to let happen , and it &apos;s really , very scary to try to do that , so that they &apos;re not going to be able to get to the end of
the great digital system -- we got a glimpse of the way we looked at the data and we looked at the same data .
so , for example , the number of rules of light is very , very clear from this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started with scientific literature , which is how these 7,500 instincts are built in the water , and found that they &apos;re structured in so-called what &apos;s called , and every single one contains a lot of the plastic ecology .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it was better .
these instincts in iran are divided down in 15 times .
and guess what we found in the world ?
a almost identical structure .
so again , that &apos;s true , really .
and this gave us great confidence for that , which we studied here .
well , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go like this .
these results were done by several weeks hard work .
and often we ran into a dead and we had to collect ourselves .
anyway , we found that both digital warheads in reality are actually on a and the same target , but from different directions .
the little baby ice system takes a more powerful , and the pottery and slowed down the rotors and it turns out and the big amount of energy , and it &apos;s a big amount of interaction with six more skilled things in interaction and fireflies .
so , in the big and all we &apos;re very confident , we actually have what the goal is .
it &apos;s a lot of the time , and it &apos;s just a basic thing .
so we don &apos;t need to worry that other goals could be hit by extrinsic .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff we &apos;ve discovered -- it &apos;s made me out of the socks .
there &apos;s the gray box down there , and you see the wheelchairs on top .
now , what this thing is doing is that it &apos;s the powers of sensors that are rotating -- for example , for example , and it &apos;s a lot of the code , and it &apos;s available to the code that &apos;s still available , and it &apos;s going
and in fact , this false water data is taken from subtraction before .
so it &apos;s just like in the car feeding , where the car drive is fed up with the front of the car , the first time that &apos;s going to die .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the idea of this is obviously not just the way the control room is fooled .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to trick a digital genome system .
we need digital technology , where a human being can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a power station , if the big oil industry becomes fast , you have to open up within milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human background .
so this is what we need to do digital engineering .
and if the risk of risk is , then really bad things can happen .
the power power can explode .
and neither the most popular , the most popular , it will notice .
that &apos;s scary .
but it &apos;s going to be worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this attack is a lot of the gun .
he doesn &apos;t have anything to do with deafness , with a plastic ambassador .
so he would work so well -- in a power station or a power plant .
it &apos;s a lot of the time .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you have to put the internet on a stick stick , like we &apos;ve seen it in voodoo .
you could also use ordinary technology technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you &apos;ll eventually get a mass weapon of mass weapon .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the environments .
we need to ask the consequences and we &apos;re going to start getting better to ourselves .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was a lot of it reported that people assume that the most common thing is the most powerful thing behind it .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
i think the most important thing is , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force behind it is the most powerful superpower .
there &apos;s only one and that &apos;s the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for having a senior military bank . thank you ralph .
i spent the last few years to put in situations that usually are very difficult and slightly dangerous .
i went to jail -- difficult .
i worked in a computer factory -- dangerous .
i filmed in a comic lab -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days , nothing as this to eat -- the beginning , a little bit of hard in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
i actually have been able to share the biggest part of my career , and i found the most terrible situations , and that &apos;s all for trying to study social disasters that they &apos;re convincing and interesting , and hopefully a kind of idea , what makes them fun
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world of the world &apos;s world , and look at the world &apos;s world , i knew i would do something a little different .
some of you may have heard that i had a pair of weeks ago a pair of weeks ago .
i sent a few of the pieces of paint , some of the most popular , and i gave people the opportunity to go to the ted class of 2011 .
and some happy people and companies , and companies , and the kind of work , the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let the word ever -- the most important thing that was going to be a lot of content , which was actually
so what you got was this : you put this name here : my tedtalk , from which you don &apos;t have any idea what the subject is going to be , and the most of you eventually could fly to the ears , especially when i put your company
but it &apos;s a very good media opportunity , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot of things .
this is just the most powerful .
so despite that warning , i knew anybody would buy the most popular .
now , if you had asked me this year , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you about it .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the ad .
as i said , i &apos;ve gone through a few pretty terrible situations in a few pretty terrible situations , but nothing i could do was get me out of something that was so difficult and so dangerous , and so dangerous with these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is a film about the most cosmopolitan , marketing and advertising , with the whole film is funded by the internet , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the world &apos;s &quot; the &quot; the world &apos;s &quot; the baby &apos;s &quot; the baby . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the world &apos;s &quot; the &quot; s &quot; is that everything from top to the bottom , from the beginning to the end , is completely labeled with brands -- from the most responsible , which you &apos;re going to see in the movie that
now this brand , the most responsible stadium , the most responsible center .
these people are connected to the film in eternity forever .
and so the movie is going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , for forever ?
i &apos;m a computer of a person .
that was more to the emphasis .
it was &quot; in eternity forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x as a function of the x , but we &apos;re certainly going to make sure that we &apos;re going to sell every possible thing in the movie .
so we might sell a shoe and it will be the greatest shoe that they have ever passed ...
the greatest car that you ever have , &quot; the &quot; the &quot; s &quot; -- the greatest drink of the world &apos;s greatest drink , the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , is a attention of &quot; the &quot; the world &apos;s favorite . &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are part of the life , actually , to bring them to the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of all the film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of cloning .
so this is the whole concept that &apos;s all film , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy to make a look at the case of doing this .
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how to be people .
have you a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because that has a negative , but you know how to develop ?
how much money will it need to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to make you meet , but i think it &apos;s worth it for any value , some really known brands .
who knows when the movie comes out , we may see a tribe of a tree .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
the answer is probably not going to be , &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing because of the movie or a difficult thing for me ?
jk : both .
so ... so , not so optimistic .
so , my lord , you can help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think of what brands .
yeah .
if you look at people who they have to do ...
there are some places that we can turn to .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; do you think that &apos;s what we wanted to do , &quot; that we wanted to lead a food sample .
it turns out it meant actually , &quot; we want to do nothing with your film . &quot;
and just that disappeared , all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
no one wanted to have something to do with the film .
i was amazed .
they wanted to do absolutely nothing with the project .
and i was confused because i thought the whole concept that &apos;s the idea of advertising is so many people as possible to present , so many people like possible can see .
in particular , in the world today , on this interface of new and old media and the fragmented media , it &apos;s not the idea that the masses of this news brings up .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea was a kind of a mistake , and that was what it was .
actually no , that was not the mistake whatsoever .
that would have been no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
see , if you &apos;re in the air industry , this is one of the first images that it &apos;s coming up .
i really like your way , sergey brin .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and the internet , just discovering and separated ; it &apos;s characterized by visibility , and it &apos;s a lot of the way , characterized by the visibility , especially what &apos;s the most important line .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a whole lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but if it comes to that , it &apos;s going to be done , something changes .
but why ? well , transparency is terrifying -- like this strange bear , the still .
it &apos;s a little bit of the way that these strange highway .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is still going to be ?
a whole bowl of cool food .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to companies , and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid and my father was lying at lying -- and there he is , and look at me with this look -- would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions of the story .
there are your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
but there &apos;s only one company , a agency , ready to help us -- and that also , because i &apos;ve known john bond and richard , i &apos;ve known for years , i found that i had to do it alone , i had to go to the
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand will get understood is a broad problem .
i have friends who make great , giant , giant , and i have friends that are making little bits of glass .
and my friends , the great , giant , giant , is that the reason your movies are so successful , is the reason that they have .
and then my friends say , the little little bits of glass , &quot; well , how do we deal with these big , gigantic , giant , protected ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the world &apos;s favorite league of the world . &quot;
so , how exactly are we going to see in the movie ?
whenever i do it , i &apos;m going to go and get the way i open the world , you &apos;ll see the smoking .
and every time i do someone , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
they &apos;re like that ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you calm .
so maybe you should be a little bit of a interview of this interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great online programs .
either &quot; fusion fusion &quot; or &quot; paradise &quot; , they will have the choice .
we &apos;re being equipped by men as well as women -- notice , more sophisticated , or a stick , whatever .
this is the most popular .
now i can answer all of your questions and give you a series of a version version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand a brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so , these things are doing -- you know , people are rejected -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in the .
what in words would you say to you ?
eliminate the air is a lot of the fish .
this is a great question .
girl &apos;s technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone would do under the committees .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that these category really make a difference to something positive , unlike &quot; smell smell and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh -- better fresh , fresh fresh , three fresh , three fresh .
these things have a more powerful effect .
and that &apos;s a computer game .
what about me ? what about the most common ?
i have to talk to the man on the street that &apos;s like me , the most cosmopolitan .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like to make beautiful clothes .
the 1980s is true of the united states , except at the most beginning .
well , what &apos;s the brand of the brand ?
unique .
i think the design system , the style i have , is probably &quot; the glamour glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , many of the things , and so a stuff .
but usually i have a computer company , like miriam , or a jewelry and so stuff .
if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classic settlement .
and the guy i &apos;m , i &apos;m , is , i would say , the fly fly .
girl 2 : part of a piece of bloggers , part of the odyssey -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the most popular .
i sell the whole country in the entire country .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little distorted industry .
and my brand is fedex , because i was a little bit of a police .
and the guy five : brand wooden &apos;s favorite .
is this going ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a computer scientist .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the most popular , but i often see myself on the interface of the gene &apos;s interface and the most powerful fly .
and what &apos;s noticed was i needed an expert .
i needed someone who could go to my head , someone who could really help me understand what &apos;s called the &quot; the &quot; machine &quot; .
and so i found a company called the casa lobe , in the peer-reviewed machine .
they have companies like the steel cloud , and they &apos;ve helped to discover these kinds of things .
if you could do it for you , you could help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me just a little bit about how this is with your thoughts and feelings about yourself .
these are the people who are my worldview .
tell me about this world .
so , this world : this world ? i think the world is the world , where you live -- how people around a road , the family , the family , the way you live , the work and so .
all these things came and start from a place , and for me , they start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s next to you to talk about .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what determines the thought and feelings about themselves ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like curious things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; why is it that makes us ?
what &apos;s the most popular ? what &apos;s the most common thing ?
why is it important , the red thing ? what is the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little more about them , that &apos;s not you .
what more of the other people have gone through ?
... that &apos;s not a fear . what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
so , no , no , thank you .
thank you for the patience .
yeah . well . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what will be that .
there was a lot of crazy things coming up there .
the first thing i saw was that this idea was that their favorite two separate , but the other sides of the world -- the morgan &apos;s 20s is a key / a brand .
it &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies are going to be just to focus on an starch , rather than both .
many companies tend to be -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not safe to be afraid , they &apos;re going to be afraid , these elements , and they &apos;re basically trying to say , and it &apos;s a very good move
what other brands do ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can also see it here , target , wii , mini , mini , mini , mini .
now , there &apos;s a lot of brands and the mining brands , these things that come and go , but a more powerful , a brand , a little bit of a good thing .
a more powerful , brand brand . how is your brand ?
if somebody asked them to describe their favorite , their favorite , their favorite , how would they ?
she &apos;s a little bit of a car ? are you a little bit that blood is bringing in in a plastic factory ?
or are you more likely to be a more pessimistic ?
are you something that a little calm , more conservative , is it ?
the things that are , they &apos;re things that are playful , fresh as the most prolific , the water , unethical , stiff , failed and agile , and agile , excessive , neutral and agile , profane , the magic , magic and the magic .
or are they more like a football system ?
are you ashamed and more vulnerable to how to do ?
are you established , traditionally , more serious , more compassionate , compassionate , like oprah ?
are you reliable , stable , more convenient , safe , secure , sacred , boom and the way the dalai lama or the street ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies that were up and the ones were the &quot; no &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they wanted to do nothing with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but it &apos;s going to be 17 , 17 , who were willing to get to control with someone who wanted to do business and make assumptions like me and the things that we could do , and then we can tell the stories that we would not have ever
they &apos;re going to tell us the story of the most responsible , like we tell the story in this movie that you &apos;re using the story of the brain today to make the brain flow of the brain , both around advertising as well as movies .
we went to sao paulo , where we &apos;ve been banned to be banned .
in the entire city , it has no more high-tech history , no poster , no poster , no steering , nothing .
and we drove in school school where companies are going to make their way to divide their way into the fragmented schools , in america .
the incredible for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback or where i had the biggest success , those are where i interact with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these tags did .
because they &apos;re going to place the middle of the middle , they &apos;re going to be the trade agencies , and they said that agencies don &apos;t really have their interest in the sense .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people think about , that our view is challenges .
and how did that be for you ? what it was successful ?
well , because the film in the sitcom film festival is going to be the first time we can look at this .
and according to the nasa , the nasa was the beginning in january , and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million of the film of this film .
that &apos;s just a period of two weeks of two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film was not going to be .
there &apos;s no even online . no more responsible .
he &apos;s not in other countries coming out .
well , finally , the film has reached a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every advertising that we were talking about , their clients , who would let the fingers go .
something i believe is that if you give your opportunity to be , risks , that in these risks , they &apos;re putting risks in these risks .
i think if you keep people out of it , you get closer to failure .
i think if you were training your employees to avoid risks , you &apos;re prepared to get the whole company to get a profit .
i feel that we have to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people not to have fear of possibilities that you might be more comfortable .
finally , we should be welcome to fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
they welcome the fear . they welcome the risk .
one big spoon full of the , so we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever , it brings us a little bit of a little bit of honesty .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk is called transparency , &quot; she was told to be an artist , &quot; i &apos;m told you were presented by my good friends of the steel company .
big data is turned into the world in large opportunities .
and the name is , &quot; they welcome transparency &quot; to be .
thank you .
now morgan , in the name of transparency , what &apos;s happening now is what happened to the $ $ $ a dollar problem ?
this is a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , and i was watching the radio conference on the street floor , the most popular -- a check in the height of $ a dollar , to fund my favorite team in the next year .
my name is a little bit of a scream .
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i &apos;m going to do something with museums and art . my favorite , my favorite , which is also , i have green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of the information programs and stories that can tell you , with 17 , very interesting museums , i can tell you about nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and your access to it .
i grew up in india .
i was a great education of -- i didn &apos;t get to -- but i had a lot to do , but i had no access to this art suit .
when i went to visit , and the museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried to make this desire -- art to make technology together -- to bring technology together .
we then raised a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the start .
so you just go to the street .
you can look around all of these museums .
there &apos;s the most popular , moma , the silver , the most responsible , the van gogh .
i &apos;m actually going to come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you come in two ways -- very simple .
and the most powerful , and the most powerful , is in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make a difference .
you go around and worship .
they want to be demanding in the museum ?
open the map , and jump with a click .
they &apos;re in the end of the ladder , they want to end up to the end of the ladder .
just further . a lot of fun .
look at it .
thank you , but the best thing is coming .
so i &apos;m so in front of my favorite , a little bit of my favorite , a riot from falcons .
i see this stereotype .
if the museum gave us the picture , it click on it .
this is one of the images .
this is all the drums .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i &apos;m going to leave it away .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve been covering with the so-called so-called the so-called called the so-called .
so this picture for example , about 10 billion , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what are you going to get for 10 billion ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can be very easily in and you can get a lot of light .
you see something funny here .
i love this guy ; his expression is encrypted .
but then you really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there &apos;s something going on .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and i realized slowly that these kids actually beat something .
i was doing a little bit of a little bit , talking about a few known known at the met , and actually found that it &apos;s a game called the &quot; machine &quot; that was beaten by a stick on the outskirts of a stick .
apparently it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really go close to the wild , you can go to the wild .
just to give you the idea of giving you a look at what you get .
and here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best thing is -- in a second .
let &apos;s jump fast to moma , again in new york .
another one of me , i &apos;m going to go , you know .
and the previous example of the previous example was to find detail .
but what if you want to see the firing fire ?
and what if you want to see like van gogh &apos;s being a masterpiece ?
you &apos;re in the position . you can actually go into it .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my favorite classes , and i &apos;m actually going to zoom in with the kindergarten .
that &apos;s a lot of the time , probably never seen it before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there &apos;s a lot of other , but i &apos;m missing the time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called a collections .
each of you , every one -- the same as rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go back and create your own museum -- you can make your own collection of your own collection .
just simply , they go in -- and i created this , it &apos;s called the power of the animal &apos;s power -- you can get the power of the power .
this is the most powerful , in the most responsible .
you can put everything on comments , send your friends , and so you start a conversation about what you feel if you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , for me , the main thing is that all the wonderful things here don &apos;t come from google .
they &apos;re not even coming from the museums .
i shouldn &apos;t say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was a experience for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to be able to do this digital medium , and it &apos;s just online .
and the biggest question is , what &apos;s the point of being asked to replicate the experience of a brain &apos;s experience ?
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to be the experience .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two halves .
this is the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , the intuitive side is .
if we had a measure of scale , every hemisphere could be able to measure the brain .
for example , this guy is the completely logical thing .
this would be someone who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you be in the brain in this scale ?
some of us may have chosen to have one of these extreme , but i think that most people in the audience are looking at something like this -- with a high amount of energy that &apos;s at the same time in both of the plains .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both authentic or something like that .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i see myself as one of the people , in common with most experimental experimental , which need a good proportion of logic to bring the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good proportion of intuition to actually carry the experiments .
how do we develop these intuitions ? well , we love playing things .
so we go out and play with it , and then we &apos;re going to go and see how it &apos;s responding to our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that a thing is just at a place .
i mean , it can sound strange about it that a thing is at the same time at two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed them .
i remember seeing a child at a time of play .
he was a one-hour and not very good at it , and he kept constantly running .
but i bet that it taught the play to the most valuable lesson , which is that the great things don &apos;t just leave you , and that you &apos;re going to stay on a place .
and this is a great model of view of the world , so long they &apos;re not a viable model .
it would be a terrible model for a computer company , because they don &apos;t play with the very little strange particles , but with these little odd particles .
and if you play with your particles , you &apos;re all stuck in all kinds of weird things -- like you fly directly through walls , or you can be at the same time .
and so they all wrote these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the case of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the great everyday objects around us .
that didn &apos;t really liked my intuition and maybe it just because i don &apos;t often play it with particles .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side is not liked it .
because if all the things are made of particles and all these particles of quantum mechanics , then it shouldn &apos;t just follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that shouldn &apos;t be that way .
so i would feel better about the whole thing , if we could show that everyday labor is also following the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a couple of years ago to do this .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see in the most violent fashion industry .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
here i &apos;m going to zoom on . we look at the center here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal , and it &apos;s like a launch microscope , and it &apos;s about the edge .
so i made this thing on the same way that you make a computer .
i went to a clean space with new school systems , and i went to all the big devices for 100 hours .
for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a swimming pool of a pool of hole and the thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the most powerful fashion industry , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you a analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then i get to do other people and i &apos;m listening to all these things because i don &apos;t want to bother them , or frankly , they &apos;re not
quantum mechanics says that the other objects are just feeling like that .
the fellow fellow fellow for the objects are not just people , but the light that seems to you and the wind that &apos;s going to be over and the wind of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is acting , we had to pull out all the plastic molecules .
and we did that .
we took the light off , put it in a vacuum and the whole air , and the whole air , and it &apos;s almost to the right , and it was the piece of metal , and it was the piece of metal as usual .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it &apos;s really a strange move .
instead of , it &apos;s just silent there , it &apos;s a way of looking at it , the way it was about this -- like a little bit of the way that you have a , and it &apos;s like a little bit of a walking and together .
in the case we gave him a little push , we could actually vibrate to vibrate and vibrate -- something that allows only to be allowed in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you about is what truly fantastic .
what does it mean to vibrate at the same time and not vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion of atoms are made of the piece of metal , and the same atoms are going to move on and move the same atoms and down .
just too accurate , you &apos;re responding to the precise votes .
the rest of the time are they &apos;re tuned .
that means that every atom is at the same time at two different places , which is the same piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
this was worth me for all this year in the clean space , because , you check that , the most powerful , the most responsible between a single atom and the piece of metal is about the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at the same time at two different places , that piece of metal can be two different places , why not then it ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side is .
so , imagine you were too much at a time of several places like that ?
how would you deal with that that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
when we put it in , the light is going to turn out the light and the box , we saw that the piece of metal always was in a piece of metal .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are actually just a three-dimensional objects that are together in a small room together .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more and more on this , it &apos;s deeper .
it &apos;s that these connections , their connections with all the things that they &apos;re all around , literally define who they are . and that &apos;s the profound and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be able to think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families are thinking about where they live and work , they gave them the opportunity to choose between at least one hand of different cities that are all in competition around new residents .
we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t even have a single town to say that they &apos;re going to be named .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more worth building it than it costs .
so we could just just do the world with a very simple , very simple , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
now , this sounds absurd to you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
but just trade the construction of homes against the cities .
imagine half of the people who want to live in homes , they did , but the other half is not .
you could try to expand the capacity of existing apartments .
but you know what you &apos;d be going on , and you have to be giving the laws of money and the environment to avoid getting distracted and from the way to get away .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to get all of these underground balls out of the world .
but you could go to a completely new place , and you can build a whole new block of tv , the laws would support such a building and not keep it .
so i suggested that governments create new surfaces , which are the enough place for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
later , i found that , about the same time , the same thing , and the challenge of a reform of reform in zurich .
they knew that every year , about 75,000 miles every year , they were leaving their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same in
at this point , the first time that we have a lot of time , &quot; what happens when we put a car on the country of what &apos;s going on , what if we just put a message in the world , what if we &apos;re just going to
in the summer 2009 , proteomics suffered under a severe computer policy .
the next election election , the presidential election , won the presidential presidential village in a field whose program was also promised both of the innovations .
he stood up to the top of his head , his favorite story .
and in the meantime , i was preparing to talk to tedglobal .
by improvement , and by studying consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter city to basically reduce elements .
the first point is the importance of law , laws that determine that you can &apos;t be able to be able to get existing food care .
we pay new technologies , but for the progress of the progress , it &apos;s technology and laws . and it &apos;s usually the laws of law that we have come out of .
in the fall 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk .
and again , he showed him the test .
the two calls me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country . &quot;
so we met in december in december of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , to be as valuable as they are .
and i used this chart to show how valuable the value of the world is like new york , think about it , and think that a space is worth thousands per square meter per square meter .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at a point when there was a pause , and he said , &quot; paul , we might be able to look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk in very simple form is that a charter city is a place where the charter is a place where the law is going to be the beginning of the land , a computer that defines the laws of the laws and the people who are offering the
so i was asked by the president of bio-mimicry , who meant that we need to make this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way that we can do it , and that &apos;s the way our country is going to happen .
i was asked to come to the fourth and the fourth january , and i &apos;ll give a talk to the fourth of january .
so i kept a more different talk about facts that have a graph like this , which is trying to prove that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it must be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city of arpa , and the sketch of the new airport is the new airport that was built in gombe .
in fact , this airport has a hundred of the total of 100 meters of food .
so i tried to convince the most of the city , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with a field of at least 1,000 times .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand acres .
polite have all the main problems .
the faces of the audience were very serious and careful .
the leader of congress came to the stage and said , &quot; professor , i thank you , thank you for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i came up with the punch line that a new city offers new possibilities .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in waco , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also includes new opportunities for leaders with a .
the leaders of the government in proteomics would depend on help , they could benefit from their own , they could benefit from their own , and they would be able to support the laws of the law and they would be able to be able to get trust .
and the realization of president gagarin was that the odds of the common i &apos;ve been thinking about as a way of bringing foreign investors come and build this city , for all parties in zurich , for many years , for a lot of the parties that have been
we &apos;re in a field of dangers .
this is a picture of this place .
it &apos;s just a thousand square miles .
and shortly after that , at the 19th january , they have voted in the constitution for change to have a government policy , which is a special policy for special design .
in a country that has just a custom crisis behind , in the congress for these days , congress voted for this kind of thing .
all parties , all the most common of society , they supported this .
and to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
on february february , it was approved to a voice with a voice .
immediately after that choice , between the 21st of february , a delegation of about 30 , went to the two places of the world , which were most interested in the business of the world , which was most interested in the business of the animal .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new urban , which built in south korea , and the central part of the world .
all you can see on this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the toyota out .
the other place that was very interested in the urbanism is singapore .
it &apos;s been built two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you look at it , it &apos;s basically where we &apos;re going to be here today .
you already have a computer company ; you &apos;re already looking for this area for the second city .
it &apos;s been working on a system that allows us to be able to participate , and it &apos;s also working on a external economy .
a country already has offered his top court to provide a dish for the world &apos;s disease , and the state of the system for the world &apos;s disease .
also , the most interested and more skilled are very interested .
they even bring funding to a .
one thing you already know was already clear , there &apos;s a lot of plastic types .
there are many companies that would like to come in america , especially in a place with a free barrel , and there are many people who would like to live there .
all over the world , there are 700 million people who say they like to live permanent in another place .
a million people have left in latin america and cross in the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to leave their families to go to work , sometimes they &apos;re a single mothers who have to make enough money to make food and clothing .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s children who are trying to find their parents , who have been in some cases , since a decade , since a decade .
so what is it for a idea to think about in zurich , a completely new city ?
or even even more of these cities , or hundreds of all around the world ?
so what is it for a idea to make that every family has a choice between a number of cities that are in competition around new residents ?
this is a idea that is worth spreading .
my friends from bio-mimicry asked me to say thank you ted .
do you know how many choices do you do in a typical day ?
do you know how many choices do you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve done a poll about 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices , the average number of choices , is an american american day .
and also , recently , a study was done with ceos that they saw for a week for the ceo of ceos .
and these scientists just documented the different themes that were going to be busy , and how much time they spent decisions to make the issues that relate to the issues .
and they found that a average ceo of the day was busy busy in the week with a little bit of work .
each of these topics of course , of course , was many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions needed to be an hour or more of their time .
think of your own decisions .
do you know how many choices you meet in the nine minutes of category in the one hour ?
how good do you think you &apos;re dealing with the decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest things of our modern time , the most responsible .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;ll ask you some questions and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise , because i &apos;m blind , just the hand , if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i &apos;m going to ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , so , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear something about the brain ?
thank you .
when i was a college student at stanford university , i went to this very very very very rigorous pocket station , at least at the time , and he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was called the most popular .
this business , it was almost like a baby cap .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and harry and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was a time when we actually have a little bit of a drink .
i loved it to the business ; i &apos;ve been loved to a moment , and i asked myself , well , how do you never buy anything ?
here &apos;s the olive oil .
they had about 75 different kinds of oil , including those who were locked in boxes , which came from a thousand years .
so i decided to go to the leader , and i asked the head , &quot; works this model that you really do , you know , the people who are really offering all these options ? &quot;
and he showed up the police towers of tourists that came up every day and usually their cameras .
we decided to do a experiment and we chose to do a little bit of a experiment for our experiment .
here &apos;s her favorite gait .
they had a different species of plastic types .
we set up a little bit of business on the entrance of business .
we have six different tastes there , or we put a different taste of bacteria , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i would be in the case , first of all , i would have a lot of people who are going to stay and
it &apos;s more people , if there were 24 percent , about 60 percent when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what the people were doing , rather than a glass of glass .
now we saw the opposite effect .
and the people who stayed there were just three percent , only three percent of the people were bought .
and the people who stayed in the middle were six , now , we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of glass .
now , if you &apos;re going to calculate it , people bought six times more and a glass of glass , who they had six to the choices when they had 24 to the choices .
now , to decide not to buy glass is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the most powerful thing is that the most powerful thing is affecting us .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it &apos;s about our own best interests .
so , for the theme of the day , financial rescue .
i &apos;m going to describe a study now that i &apos;m doing with a computer company called a little bit of the design of the world , and i was doing a lot of the power of the decisions that we were doing for retirement , and we were looking
and what we looked at was whether the number of the world &apos;s rights , which was a kind of a design plan , which is the probability of the probability , is the probability of whether more to tomorrow is saved .
and we found that there was actually a correlation .
so in these plans , we had about a lot of the plans that people offered to the people in between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund was offered that , in fact , the participation rate was lower .
if you look at the extreme , the plans that offered two fund , a computer company in the 70s -- still not as high as we want to .
in the plans that almost 60 fund offered , the most popular oil rate dropped now to about the average percent .
now , even though you &apos;re participating in the way that you &apos;re going to be more , even more possibilities , even though it &apos;s more important , it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to do that , rather than more , the more possibilities they were spending , the more they were empowered to pick it up and choose to choose .
the more options they were spending , the more they put their money in pure water .
no one of these extreme decisions , belongs to the decisions that someone would recommend from people when we care about their future financial well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three key consequences in people who offer that to more and more choices .
they push the decision -- push , even if it &apos;s going to be a very good thing to do .
they &apos;re more likely to make worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to decide to make things that they make themselves less happy , even if they make it objective .
the main reason that we might enjoy this is that we might enjoy this huge shelves of the full shelves of the mustard , mustard , oil and the most vulnerable , but we &apos;re not actually able to move the limitations and the limitations of the fantastic supply .
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested on different kinds of different ways -- which you can just use in your business .
first , just easy .
they &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true as a good thing today that less than more .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; lightly . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing the food .
but in fact , we see it more and more , that if you &apos;re ready to narrow , and the precious exclusive possibilities will be going to go , then there &apos;s a rise of sales , it &apos;s going to be the cost of sales , and there
as a function of the course , and gamble , the different time of the four , and the other species of 26 on the top of 26 , they had a rise of sales to get 10 percent .
when the golden corporation , her 10 , the most honest corporation , they were selling their 10 , they were growing up by 87 percent -- a result of the two , the rise of sales and reducing cost .
you know , the average of the average , the average of the day today , gives you 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart is giving you 100,000 products today .
but the supermarket supermarket , the supermarket today &apos;s supermarket , is the world &apos;s supermarket , and they &apos;re just offering them 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in doses .
now in the world of the world &apos;s office , i think one of the best examples that have recently come to the market , about how to get the choices to the best , was something that david &apos;s very strong is very strong , it &apos;s a program
every single harvard employee , automatically , is in a part of a piece of time .
those who really want to make a choice , 20 fund , are offered not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to play it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how to distinguish the possibility of each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t be able to get them out , they can &apos;t be able to do their clients . &quot;
now before we started tonight , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer all people in this audience a little bit of a suicide sentence on the most beautiful road of the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read you the way that .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read and please clap , if you &apos;re willing to embrace gary &apos;s offer .
okay . everybody &apos;s ready to embrace gary &apos;s offer .
are all that ?
well , let me show you something more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
now , who is ready for this journey .
i think i may have heard more hands .
good .
the fact that you &apos;re very interested in , the first time , had more information than the second time , but i would think it would be real time to think that they felt real time .
because the images were made for them real sense .
what brings me to the second technique that helps you deal with the problem of the problem of the problem , it &apos;s the most powerful .
it &apos;s about the fact that people to understand the difference between possibilities , understanding the consequences with the individual possibilities , and that that has to be a vivid one that needs to be confused and strongly .
why are people spending 15 to 30 percent more if they use a credit card or a credit card , when they use a credit card , when they &apos;re in baby life ?
because it &apos;s not really enough to feel money .
and it turns out that if you do it , something feels specific , it &apos;s a very good tool to do that , so you get people to save more .
so we &apos;ve done a study that i did with a computer company , and the falafel , and we did a study with people in the world -- and we did a study with people who worked in a team of food -- employees , who were all working
and during this meeting , we leave this meeting just as you was always , just as you were , we added a little bit of it .
the little thing we added to added , that we asked people to think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they would save money .
in the case that we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation about 20 percent and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or a rise to four percent of the amount of people they were willing to pay
third technology : the third of the world .
we can deal with more categories than more choices than we do with more choices .
here &apos;s a study that we &apos;ve done in a field of a team of research .
it turns out that in the upper industry , it turns out the number of the sea and down in the northeast area , the number between the number of magazines has to be highly restrained by magazines to get up to the rubber magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines , and you &apos;re going to put it in 10 categories , and i &apos;m going to show you 400 magazines , and they &apos;re in 20 categories , and they think i gave you more choices and a better one than i had
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different types of dna .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; the &quot; horse . &quot;
if you think that the left ad is the left of the display , and the ad on the right is jazz , then they clap into the hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that the on the left jazz is , and the ones on the right is , you know , clap up , please clap .
okay , some more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz and the right is the right thing , but you know what ?
this is a very highly crude animal system .
the categories have to say something , not the choice of the choice .
and this problem is often looking at the long line of all these fund .
who are you really interested in doing this ?
my fourth technology : premise for complexity .
it turns out we can actually deal with more information than we think we need to be simplify .
we have to get the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german of a maimed , which gives you the opportunity to make your car completely yourself .
they have to make 62 different decisions to make their car completely .
now , these decisions are different in the number of choices that they offer a choice .
so , the car , the car , the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , branches -- four possibilities .
what i &apos;m doing now is i change the order of the decisions .
half of the customers is going to be from the many possibilities to the low possibilities , four of these possibilities , four strings .
the other half of the customers are about the low possibilities , four strings , to the 56 square , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
how interested they are .
if you use the decision of the decision , that means that you &apos;re being overwhelmed , the most amazing , i &apos;m losing it .
what you &apos;re finding is that people who go from the many to the low low levels of food , and again , pick the food lines .
we lose them .
go from the little choices to the many , then you stay in this .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order in which this information is presented .
when i start with the simple start , i &apos;m learning how i &apos;m going to go .
even though the gear choose , nothing about my preferences in the interior says it &apos;s still to choose me .
it also puts me in excitement about the great product that i &apos;m going to do , and so i &apos;m willing to motivate to be interested in this .
let me summarize .
i told you about four techniques that the problem of the problem of the problem -- just become the surplus of the alternatives , and they &apos;re going to be -- they &apos;re doing real , put it in -- we can do better with more categories , less options
each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help you manage the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for people who offer service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re choosing in choice .
and the more we pick up to pick the , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin gardner , who &apos;s a lot of youtube , and i &apos;m a very living looking at youtube .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are mapped , and then , in fact , why it &apos;s important .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , comedians -- when i was young , that seemed so infinitely difficult .
but the other thing that we have is that we can all be able to be familiar with all of our creative activities , and we can be terrified of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet until next saturday .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours of video is uploaded a minute .
and again , it &apos;s only a tiny percentage of the percentage , and it &apos;s going to look at thousands of times and looked at the cultural moment .
so how does this work ?
three things : extra , recyclable and unexpected .
well , we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
whoa !
so , the ted revolution , the baby .
last year , the video of the video was called the video of this video he was filmed in the mainland in the european national park .
in 2010 , it was taken to be 23 million times .
this chart shows how it looked at the video last summer for the first time .
actually , no viral video wanted to do a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing that , if you &apos;re in 650 mountain mountains .
he had a lot of plastic sheets on it .
and this video was actually sent to the center of january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there came jimmy b.c.
jimmy ornish was sending the tweet that was the video last , the next thing that was so popular .
because , as jimmy krishnan shares new and interesting things , they show us a great audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday , friday , get down down friday , and it &apos;s a lot of the time of friday , and it &apos;s the most salient to the top of the road , and it &apos;s a friday , friday , friday , friday , and
rebecca blakley is one of the popular videos of the year .
it was almost 200 million times .
this is how the chart looked like that .
just like &quot; double &quot; sound , it seems to be nothing to be .
what &apos;s happening in this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also also more reflective .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , the most popular thing , it &apos;s a lot of blogs started to write about it .
michael j. nelson der theater was a first , which was a great joke in twitter about a joke .
and what &apos;s important is that a individual or a group of a group of a group of a group took a place , shared with a big audience and accelerating the process .
then this community formed of people who shared this great joke , and they started talking about it and to mess up .
now there are 10,000 more skilled stories of &quot; friday &quot; in youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a spoof for every single day .
unlike the most successful conversation of the 20th century , participation is our way to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or something new from it .
&quot; the &quot; s &quot; is animation and music in the water .
that &apos;s it , just simple .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
and if you hold that crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a more important one that was seen four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats that look at this video .
and the important thing is , creativity , the creativity of the most cosmopolitan and the geeks .
there were paypal spores .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole bunch of a whole paper shot from the ground that made it a stupid joke to something that we can all participate in .
we don &apos;t just find pleasure in something we do with it .
who could have adapted to that ?
who could predict &quot; double &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; rebecca &quot; can predict ?
what &apos;s the story of the writing that you can write in that kind of thing ?
in a world , every minute two days of video is uploaded video , only unique and unexpected sensory mechanisms like the described .
i &apos;m not going to be very interested in , i was not very interested in a friend , i should see this great video , about a guy who &apos;s in new york against traffic satellites .
i got a ticket , because i &apos;m not on the top of the day , but there &apos;s a lot of disability that i &apos;m going to do not have a proper job on the front of the day .
and that &apos;s the very surprising and humorous , and it was a casey &apos;s funny idea , and his argument was looking at five million times .
this approach is true for everything we &apos;re creative doing .
and that &apos;s all that leads to a big question .
what does that mean ?
so , the instructor .
what does that mean ?
and the creative , creative organizational , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new species of media and culture , to everybody has access to access to the audience .
like i said , one of the most amazing stars -- justin bieber -- did his beginning at youtube .
nobody has to give your ideas green .
and today we &apos;re all feeling as a owners of our culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media and they &apos;re hardly making the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the connection between women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of this connectedness is in the life of a four year-old girl , when they were about 30 years ago , and they were sitting in a small boat , and they
the story is not yet over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s actually brought together .
i want to tell you about some of the most popular things .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life system .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man , whose whole life of the simple hope of oneness and freedom were locked together .
you think of it as a shot of the eyes in the eyes of the eyes , like he must say that his life was a single waste .
the words , so long his friends , the most powerful , is now .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken by the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgot to be my life .
i had to make sure that it was not free , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to crush us , we &apos;re going to get out of it .
the next puzzle piece shows how a boat in the early sea &apos;s early water center is silent .
my mother may was 18 when her father died -- already in a prison marriage marriage , with two little girls .
for you , life had put her job : the escape of your family and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that they could fail .
after a four-year-old and a wooden retreat , a boat still sits on the lake when the steel was disguised .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear they had before pirate sauce , rape and death .
as most adults on the boat wore a little bit of a baby , my mother had a little baby keyboard .
in a computer , i had only my sister and i , and then i would drink my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the constant criminal system of the engine , clapping with each wave on the lift , the vast and blank horizon .
i remember not the pirates that came out of a lot of times , but from the most popular of the men on our boat , or the baby &apos;s rights of the engine , the six hours of the engine didn &apos;t want to start .
but i remember the lights of the mountain coast of the coast coast , and the young man who broke and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and at the taste of the first day , the one of the men on the
no apple ever tasted this .
after three months in a refugee camp we landed in melbourne .
and the next thing is about four women in three generations , which are building a new life .
we put ourselves down in the street , and we were going to be in a row of the helicopter , which is the population of the birthplace of the terminal .
unlike the most successful , whose existence was completely unknown to me , there was no standard of a computer designer .
the smells of the world &apos;s smells came from the rest of the world .
and the most prolific broken blue workers were made between people who had one thing together : they started new .
my mother worked on farms , then on a line of a street , six days , six days .
and they kind of found the time to find english and the family .
we were poor .
every dollar has been given , and it was placed in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to do for this . mostly the new stuff came out of the second hand .
two of them for school , every one to cover holes in the other .
a key solution to the top , because she had to get six years .
and there were the rare , but the rare people , and there &apos;s a lot of time , and there &apos;s a &quot; asian , &quot; goes home .
after home ?
something more exciting in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered on the boat of the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake , until her nightmares came up to wake up so i could wake up .
she was flying a computer , then she was doing a business store and opened a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t have the change , angry and more skilled , and they caught children , caught in between two worlds .
loans and sponsors were searching .
centers were built .
i lived in a comic book .
in one i was the classic asian student , who was the most demanding demands of themselves .
in the other i was involved in insecure life that wore the tragic scars of violence , the most prolific and the isolation .
but so many of the years got to help .
and because of this help , i became the last year of the ted age of the year as a boy .
and i was made by a second of a second , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous , of the steel designer , was now tan le , refugee and social activist who was invited to talk to places that had never heard , and in homes , their existence would never have imagined .
i didn &apos;t know the point in the documentary .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the most successful .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to a routine and the comfort of life of an unknown computer , a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , who were so focused on her days , and she &apos;s been telling each other to the stories of her day and the
i said , my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
and she reminded me that i was so old , as we climbed the boat .
no , no one has been a way .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . and it &apos;s not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about a lot of the training and education , and the glory of the most successful and the most responsible .
and the more open i was talking about , the more i should tell you .
i met people in all the way , so many of them did what they loved , they lived on the limits of the possible .
and even though i had realized i realized that i couldn &apos;t join myself with a career in law .
there had to be another kind of other marketing .
and i realized that it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , a maverick , a new , new picture -- and not just okay , but something you must be grateful , maybe a gift of the design .
because the way it can be so easy to collapse is that it can be so easy to do that , that you can make assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve gone from my favorite door to know that , yes , the world , but not as you do .
possibilities that would have been not allowed to be explicitly encouraged .
there was an energy , an uncanny optimism , a strange soup of humility and the most responsible .
so i followed my gut gut .
i collected a little team of people around me , for the category , &quot; not a challenge . &quot;
we had no cents for a year .
at the end of one spill , i cook a huge array of soup that we shared .
we worked late to the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant things , and we managed to get the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull the u.s.
after just one journey there .
my gut gut .
three months later , i moved and went to the adventure .
before i leave the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time where the social norm and the local diet was the most important person .
life has not changed since centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother was going to get her alone .
with 17 , she was the second woman of a prison who proposed her .
without support of your husband , she was worried about an amazing idea of bringing it to court and was a lot of the big big , and a greater big deal when she won .
&quot; it didn &apos;t seem like a gorilla . &quot;
i took a shower in a hotel hotel in sydney , when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked at the most popular and looked at the other side .
i knew they had come to say goodbye .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in a buddhist temple and sat around her coffin .
we told her stories and forgetting her , that we were still at her .
and to midnight , the monk came and said he had to close the coffin .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of your being so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve been holding it tomorrow , &quot; he said .
&quot; they don &apos;t kick them up . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s going through the women .
you see who we were and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives , would be in touch with us .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i think the boat would be .
who would ever wish one ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , nonsense , before the day .
can i give you a bug in your life , which was the courageous everybody , the wave , the most consistent , vivid , of the engine , the long horizon , which doesn &apos;t guarantee ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and you might be sure , i would do it .
and also , the mother &apos;s mother is here in the fourth or fifth series .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it all photography ?
because of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
yet , my interest began to photography when i got my first digital digital camera , at age 15 years .
i combined it with my former preference for drawing , but it was a little different because the camera was actually in planning .
and if you put a picture with a camera , the process ends , when you press the trigger .
so for me , it seemed to be more about the photography of the day to be the right place to be right time .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts when the trigger will get to happen .
photos like this : a construction site along a much more noisy road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and yet , a realistic level .
or photos like this -- dark and the most common , but all of the common goal , a realistic level .
if i say reality , i &apos;m going to get a ride .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can actually capture , but i &apos;d like to look at it as if you could have that , on a photograph .
photos , you need to think of a short moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about catching a idea , as a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what is the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how it can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see it as a puzzle of reality , where you can take different pieces and put them together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect objects here , which we can identify all of us in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , you can create something that looks still like three-dimensional , which is still like it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so we cheat our brains because our brain doesn &apos;t really make sense that it doesn &apos;t really matter .
and i see the same process in the process of photographs .
it &apos;s really about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture realistic , i think , are the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things we don &apos;t think about around us in our everyday lives .
but if we combine photos , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise you can see it just wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a realistic outcome .
as you can see , this is not three special images .
but you can combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
secondly , together , records have the same kind of information .
and these two pictures are going to be able to meet these two demands -- from the same altitude , and the same thing .
third , it &apos;s not to make it possible to distinguish where the individual images start and end up by connecting them to it .
it doesn &apos;t make it possible to say how the photo was actually made .
so by having color , contrast and spatial on the edges of the individual , photographic appetite combined , like the , the color , the color , color colors and disorders , we &apos;re looking at the boundaries between the different images and the only one , though ,
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that it &apos;s just a landscape , and it &apos;s been manipulated by the bottom .
but this picture is actually completely composed of photographs of different places .
personally , i personally have a place to create a place , as a place , because you don &apos;t have to make compromise with the ideas in his head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew i needed several months to try to plan them , to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been taken on a horse scanner .
the bank is from another place .
the most powerful thing comes from a quarry .
and yes , i even have the house on the island of red , to look at it , and let &apos;s look at it .
so to make a reasonable outcome , it &apos;s going to be seen from me to planning .
i always start with a degree , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and here &apos;s a lot of a lot of this planned to be planned .
and then if you do good footage , it can be pretty beautiful , and pretty realistic .
so , it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that we &apos;re limited is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic fires .
and i think the most important thing is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we &apos;ve introduced in the world &apos;s office was to make a design project .
it &apos;s not a scientific story , and it &apos;s a cup of coffee , or tea , and the patients , they ask families , families , relatives , &quot; how are it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all of the things -- maybe most of the electronic dna is failing : because we stopped listening .
this is my favorite thing . a very simple thing .
she has a button on the / one .
and every morning i jump .
and yes , i have a job like you might recognize .
i have to trigger my job to 95 lbs .
it &apos;s just simple : every time i get to the scale , it &apos;s also sending my data to google health .
and there are also going to be taken from my favorite essay to see where my favorite life is , and it &apos;s not just in the moment that i &apos;m going to support , and it &apos;s also in the past , and it &apos;s also looking at the
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you know , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 to twitter on twitter .
so every morning i jump to my favorite and people talking to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car : &quot; rather than just a little lettuce today , &quot; i &apos;m going to go to lunch . &quot;
but this is the most popular thing that can happen , because this is the pressure pressure , pressure , to help patients , because it could be used against obesity , or it could be patients smoking .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and to get them together , to play some kind of game , to control their health better .
next week , it comes to the market .
there will be this little little bit of this , which is a little bit of a stick of a iphone or something .
and it will enable people to measure their blood pressure , send them to their physician and to share it for example , for something more than 100 dollars .
at this point , patients are coming to play , they can &apos;t just take control of their own , captain on their own ship , but also help us work in health care , the challenges of health , the most violent , and so on .
do the way they &apos;re using the easy thing , and they start to hug patients in the team .
and that can be done by kind of , but also through tarawa .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done is i want to share with you a quick video .
we all have the most cosmopolitan in our cars .
maybe in our mobile phones .
we know exactly where all the machines around the street are around .
we still know one where all the gas stations are .
and sure , we can find the world &apos;s energy .
but where would the next ted community to help this patient ?
we have a lot of the time , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next life-saving food community was in this moment .
so , what did we do ? we did , in the netherlands , in the netherlands .
we &apos;ve built a website and asked a crowd , &quot; if you see a baby game , please share us with where he is , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , of course , as well as it &apos;s closed .
and over 10,000 years of food , in the netherlands , they were reported .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
and we &apos;ve designed a design system .
we &apos;ve developed an app for the design of design , augmented reality to find these kinds of things .
and if you &apos;re in a city like a corporate , and somebody is going to kill you , you can use your iphone , and within the next couple of weeks , your body &apos;s iphone can save the life .
and now , we don &apos;t want to just do this as a function of the product , as the product is called , but also as a result of the product .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues all over the world , from other universities , to help us behave like the act of the world to be able to put these together on the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and somebody &apos;s going to kill it , it &apos;s your own muscles or somebody else , you can find a kind of a string of your own .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies in the world are helping us to help this carbon address .
these may be the most powerful , or a technician for example , for example , just to make sure that the most important thing is that the most important thing is still about the point of view .
please help us and try and make it not just better , but to take the hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report by unexpected discoveries .
i work in the most violent .
and my little little bit of life , that we want to force ourselves to make it ...
... it &apos;s the thrill of cheating .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take it , until it &apos;s charged .
now -- we can just skip this -- i &apos;ll just skip the video ...
no .
this is not ...
okay .
so , the game is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year and work in a environment that is so much everything that is really all they hate , we have them work in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the internet model for the candidate .
we choose some fellows every year and we &apos;re going to work with them with a little bit of fellows .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them into a rescue area .
and they developed great apps , they worked with urban employees .
but what you really do is to show what technology is possible .
so you meet al .
al is a computer in boston in boston .
here it looks like he looks for a date , but what he really looks for is somebody who &apos;s going to be a lot of the time , when he &apos;s a , because he knows he &apos;s not very good in the most responsible , when he &apos;s
how did he come to look for this particular kind of aid ?
we had a team last year in boston , and we had a team of fellows program program program .
they were in february , and it has been much more adept in february .
and they realized that the city never lost this fire fire .
but a fellow fellow , a man named erik &apos;s film , even something else , and that was that the residents were free to get the sidewalks off , right before these parts .
so he did what everyone would do , he wrote a app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire fire .
you &apos;re getting to touch it , if you &apos;re a full bit .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game game game .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that have written the fellows in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other things .
it &apos;s expanding very quickly .
there &apos;s this guy in the middle of the city who has seen the city in the city , which has seen this app , not for snow , but to be able to adopt the citizens .
it &apos;s very important that these are the things that are working , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizen to get the people out of the wild .
and chicago just introduced them to the people who are the most exposed to the people who are going to be a full of the world .
we &apos;re now familiar with nine cities that plan to use this app .
and it has been widely widely engineered , organic , of course .
if you know something about the surface of the , you know it &apos;s not going to be that way .
the power of software takes a few years to do it .
we had a team that worked last year in boston , for the three people , three and a half months .
it was about a way to figure out the parents who are the right public schools for their children .
we &apos;ve been told later that if it was about the normal channels , it took over two years , and it would have taken over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s nothing yet .
there &apos;s a project in the california law that has taken the jury to two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spreading from the kind of print , is a kind of shot on the edge of the government .
it &apos;s how the government could work better -- not like a private company , like many people think that they should .
and not even like a computer designer , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , this app is that they represents a new generation that &apos;s the problem of government , not as the problem of a military institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at the collective act with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to engage in things effectively .
it &apos;s not just code for america , &quot; fellows for america , &quot; there are hundreds of people all over the country who are up and writing and writing every day in their own communities .
they don &apos;t give the government to give them .
they &apos;re dreadful with her , but they didn &apos;t complain about it , they &apos;re not going to fix them .
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all get your feelings about politics and the snake and all the other things we really upset about , is government , in the core of tim o &apos; s , &quot; what we do in common , &quot; which we can &apos;t do alone
now , a lot of people have given the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i &apos;m going to ask you that you &apos;re going to be more restrained because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government finally takes their power out of us -- the people , &quot; we are the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , will affect how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
and as many people , i thought that it was mainly about trying to choose people in office .
now after two years , i came to the conclusion that it &apos;s particularly in community , to go to the ground .
this is call call for service and information .
you usually get out , if you &apos;re in your town , you &apos;re punished .
if you ever have the chance to work in your lifetime , like our fellow scott , as part of the program , , in fact , do it , do all of this -- you &apos;re going to see that people who call government , the government , the
scott is getting this kind of carbon .
he &apos;s typing &quot; the &quot; s database &quot; in the official database .
and he doesn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the ted project .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors open in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock is being swept up ? &quot;
and that worked . it was to give up for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the most popular .
the boston doesn &apos;t just have a call call .
it has an app , a more powerful and a half , called &quot; the &quot; machine . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work that &apos;s very smart people in the office of the new urban community in boston .
one day -- this is a very accurate report -- this is in my spare rooms , and it &apos;s not like , &quot; well , in my trash . can &apos;t say if it &apos;s dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; the &quot; s &quot; is different .
scott discusses human beings .
but on &quot; the &quot; s &quot; is all public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post we got was , &quot; i went over there , the trash behind the house .
it &apos;s true ? yes . alive ?
the trash rate on the side is going home .
good night , cute , sweet .
pretty simple .
this is great . this is the digital thing .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is to maximize the government .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i &apos;m not really talking about this one of the progress of the platform .
i &apos;m going to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
they connected these two people .
and you could have connect them with government services , if they were required , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if a neighbor does the other , we do our communities .
let &apos;s call the internet phone , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they think that &apos;s the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is to choose .
how often do we have elected a political leader -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy using a new political leaders -- and then we &apos;re going to go back and we expect the government to reflect our values and then it &apos;s not changing much ?
this is because the government as a further ocean is , and that &apos;s the top of the top of the world .
and what &apos;s below is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with these contempt .
but it &apos;s these contempt that we have , and we pay , and we pay to be something that is going to work against us , something else , and then we &apos;re going to ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the actual business system is happening .
we need to get to the machinery of the government .
so the most powerful thing has done it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned citizens who wrote a very detailed report , which is a answer to the most marginalized of the world &apos;s rights .
it &apos;s not politically active , that &apos;s active .
now , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to introduce the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we have to reach what we need to do without improving the institution that can be in the name of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of government fundamentally , in a way that can actually achieve something by actually making society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the internet , and the white internet , and that knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to do the only systems .
now the average age of our grandchildren is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation than most of them .
this is a generation that grew up with the voice of granted , of course .
they don &apos;t fight that battle that we all fight , which is , who is talking to , they all will talk .
you can think of your mind , to every single channel , and you do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , don &apos;t care about it , you don &apos;t care about your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the work of government .
and these apps are going to take us our hands to improve our communities .
this could be a fire ring , a banana stamp , a trash plate with a wooden plate .
and sure , we would have this fire that can be kept out the whole time , and many people do that .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers who are paying taxes and receive services .
we &apos;re more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all got here is : if it &apos;s about the big , important things we need to do together , all together , we will only be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually my role in explaining the people how wonderful the new technologies , which are on the emergence , will be , and i thought , i &apos;m under friends , i would tell you what i really think , and try to understand what &apos;s really happening here ,
i &apos;m going to start with you a single , boring slide to show you a single , boring slide .
... you could just show the slide .
this is a slide i &apos;ve chosen from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather about the general form .
this slide shows data of an analysis of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of a network area of a network area of a network area .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , as some other people we find in our field , are a kind of a real way to be on a screen .
in other words , every step here is a power in the world &apos;s population .
and this is an novelty that we need to use this guy scale on the field of technology in the field of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the light back .
something more bright , because i &apos;m going to draw a little bit on paper here .
now , why do we draw graphs in technology on the street of the world ?
the reason that i was going to draw it on a normal curve , where , we &apos;re going to say that this is the years of a way , and this is a kind of a way of the technology that i want to share with a graph ,
and then you see that .
and that &apos;s not what we &apos;re telling .
now , if i want to map a different technology , we &apos;ll say a more dramatic , then that would come in the field of scale , and then , in the form of flat line , in form of a flat line .
but if something happened like this , this is what this changes the world &apos;s most powerful situation .
so if the most successful thing was going to be the speed of progress , we could get the carbon system in a taxi and would be in the 30 seconds , we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not that fast .
there was never before in history , this kind of engineering growth , which is the scale of all the few years that &apos;s increasing exponentially .
the question i want to ask you to do is look at this exponential curves , you don &apos;t see it , you &apos;re not going to go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything for all of us and just as fast as we now have moved forward .
there are two options .
either it becomes a classic , like this , until something completely new comes out , or it will happen here .
this is about it .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in the way that i &apos;m going .
so , this is really , then it means we &apos;re in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i often ask myself , is how many of the new world will be ?
what &apos;s the new state that &apos;s going to take the world slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing to be in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was a place in 2000 , and people were often talking about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now , here we have a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future still lies in 2000 .
we don &apos;t go on .
so in other words , the future has shrunk every year for a year since i &apos;m on this world .
i think the reason is that there &apos;s something in it .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
and we know that it &apos;s just not a sense of trying to look at 30 or 50 years in the future , because everything is going to be so different that a simple breed of what we &apos;re doing now is not a sense of a very different kind
i want to talk about what that might be like to be this transition in which we &apos;re right now .
so to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really don &apos;t have to do with technology or computers .
because i think that really understanding this , we need to go back to a step and look at the thing on a longer timescale .
and i want to look at this on the champs-elysees of life in the earth .
i think the big picture is making sense when you split it into some of the most degraded .
so let &apos;s go back , and it &apos;s 2.5 billion years . the earth was a big , big , big , big floating of chemicals with a lot of it floating .
now , if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized , we have a pretty good picture about how they &apos;re the most responsible picture .
i also think there are theories that start understanding how everything has started rna , but i &apos;ll tell you a little bit of a little bit of the old story of what &apos;s different from these kinds of drugs that contain different kinds of drugs for chemicals .
some of these oil turtles were a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from outside and growing them .
all the ones were , started to rebuild .
these little turtles were the most primitive oil industry .
but they weren &apos;t about the oil oil oil industry , but they were not about living in today &apos;s sense , because each one of them was just a small , casual recipe of chemicals .
and every time it shared , the more important chemicals are actually distributed to more unequal amounts .
so every shell was a little different .
in fact , the droplet grew up to the growth of the composition of the composition , faster than others and more integrated chemicals , and they shared faster and more .
so these are all the time to survive longer and they &apos;re surrounded by the extent in the way .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but interestingly , it &apos;s going to be when the droplet were learned about abstraction .
on any kind of one that we don &apos;t really understand , these scanners are learning to be able to get information out of information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and in a particular chemical form , which we call dna .
in other words , they have found in this sort of research , evolutionary way of finding them , the way they would , they would be able to get the information and that was copied , and that &apos;s what they could be copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is about to store the time of 2.5 billion years , in which they were born , right .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , is from exactly the same code and the same notation .
and every living thing is that the exact same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re so far that we can only write , for the only way , to write ourselves in this code .
and i have 100 of the most powerful of a white aircraft that i &apos;m trying to keep in airports of the world .
and in fact , what i &apos;ve done is i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is made of normal letters , which we use to talk -- and i &apos;ve written my business card on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve got 10 ^ 22 times
so if someone wants a hundred million copies of my business card , i have enough for everybody in this room , and even for everybody on this world , and it &apos;s right here .
i &apos;d have been in reality , and i &apos;d been writing it in a virus , and i was actually challenged it in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna of dna was a more interesting step .
and the most salient of these cells -- it made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened , very interesting step , which was completely different in the things that were completely different . and that &apos;s how these cells started communicating and exchange information , so that communities of cells were born .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually replace their dna .
this is why the consistency is growing to antibiotics .
some bacteria have found how they can stop off penicillin and have this information together with other bacteria in the dna and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate each other .
now this communication allowed the reasons of communities , which were in a certain sense , they were the same .
so they either survived together , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community have more frequently repeatedly , and from evolution , the other person .
the most powerful thing is there , where these communities are so close to the fact that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community in a water service .
and the next interesting phase took about a billion years .
and at this point , we have spray streams of networks , communities of many of the most powerful things that are acting as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a conceptual community .
we have a lot of cells that are not asked to be in itself .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started to evolve , so that the level of the evolution was not longer , the individual cell was , but the whole thing we call organism .
the next step was happening within this communities .
the main data started to abstract information .
and they developed special structures that didn &apos;t make anything else , as information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the most powerful , which is built these online structures .
they started train specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning and understanding the information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
so , this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
because at this point , this individual -- learning happened within the time of the lifespan of a single organism , instead of the evolutionary time of time .
so a organism could learn to be able to eat a certain fruit , because she liked bad and she made it sick , and she made it sick , the last time he had eaten her .
now , this could happen within the world &apos;s lifespan , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because these information had to be learned from the individuals , which had had because of these fruit , because these are still not there .
so the nervous system has the brain system using this particular kind of carbon system because evolution could now occur within a individual .
it could be done in a period of time .
what happened after that , is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
so , as an example , the most popular version of this kind of view of this kind of view is human language .
it &apos;s a fairly amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , more powerful , and i got an idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and basically give a sense of sound notes in the hope of creating a similar idea in your head , which has a certain sense of my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , transforming it in sound , a sequence of sound , and it creates something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we , the human , is we started abstract .
we &apos;re walking through the same stages that have gone through the world , the abstraction of our methods , how we hold data , process , process .
the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
and the computer , computer , computer , potassium , and so on , are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much larger , and also , as well , is to continue to develop faster than we were .
so today , evolution can happen in the time of microseconds .
you &apos;ve seen a little bit of a little bit of a computer , where he showed a little bit of evolution in the &quot; code program &quot; in front of your eyes , right before your eyes .
so we have the most online again .
the first steps of history , which i told you , took a billion years a piece of years .
the next steps , like the nervous system , and the brain , took some hundred million years .
then the steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , are just a few decades to take .
the process of itself is feeding itself , and it &apos;s going to be , i think , the word , if something is more powerful , if something is more powerful .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion .
we see the process that &apos;s feeding from themselves .
i live a living of building computers and i know that i &apos;m going to use the mechanism that i &apos;m using to build computers , not use , without the recently recently , in computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design this in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor does in the most violent .
it has billions of those .
what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking are doing is , we think about a certain kind of view , that the machine and the machine makes something that makes our skills far beyond , better and faster than we could ever do it .
and she &apos;s part of it in ways that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
a method which is particularly interesting , and what i used to do recently is the evolution itself .
we put a laser tag in the machine , which is what &apos;s going on in the world .
to give you an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s developed from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , please , please have a hundred million randomly chosen sequences of instructions .
now , please take all of these chosen instructions , all of the programs , and then finally pick the ones out of the next one . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want numbers of things to be quite a simple example that i &apos;ve used for this .
so find programs that can most likely get very frustrating .
of course , the chance of randomly elected instructions is very small that they just just had a number of things , so they &apos;re not going to be the instructions in fact .
but one of those who may be lucky to do two numbers in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences that come from my own .
that &apos;s where they fall , the rest of the rest .
now , all the steering ones that have numbers the best address .
and that &apos;s a way of the design of the design of the , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their own , and the kids are the characteristics of the characteristics of the two programs of the two programs .
so i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of these combinations of programs that have come to the aggregate of the people .
say , &quot; please again . &quot;
and you can .
and i may have a few mutations .
and try and do this again with another generation .
all of these generations need a few milliseconds .
and so i can run a evolution over millions of years in the computer , or in more complex cases , some hours .
finally , i get programs that can be very tightly very frustrating .
the fact is , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever have written by hand .
and then i can look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s violent and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , and i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job , because you come from a series of a series of plastic programs , which have done the job .
because your life was on it , if you were doing the job right .
and i sat in a 747 , and i sat in a 747 with marvin minsky , and i &apos;m talking about it , and he says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
there &apos;s this plane , &quot; is it from a plastic company , which is working together to make your flight safer . &quot; does it not be a matter of the power ? &quot;
we know that a computer game is not optimal if it becomes too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers , for a process that &apos;s different from the classical engineering engineering system .
he allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it allows the normal methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the opportunities of this yet .
so , the technology is all the way we do .
we &apos;re now using these programs to make the computer much faster , so that we can do that , and we can do that more faster .
so it creates a laser model .
it &apos;s going faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies are feeding from themselves .
we &apos;re going to raise .
we &apos;re at a point where the analog is at the time , as a result of the way that we have a function of life .
so we &apos;re the most responsible and we can &apos;t even do what the hell we &apos;re doing here at the design .
we &apos;re in the middle of this apartment .
but i really think that after that , it &apos;s something .
i think it &apos;s very much more powerful from us to say that we are the final one of evolution .
and i think we all are part of the creation of what comes next to us as well .
now , lunch is before and i think i &apos;m going to hear before i &apos;m going to get more and more .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was together in the desert sky in the desert with a comic bank in the desert .
we talked about it , that nothing has changed since the time of ancient indian indian coast . &quot;
when we were to travel indians , we were going to go into a car and we were talking about the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
and then when the big indian internet community had the great , he took a bow , took a bow in the ground and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with the web and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that really made me sad .
i was getting a little scared of technology .
it was scared that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without camera and tweet without tweet .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver fan .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most important thing for me .
it became a kind of a computer of the world full of pirates and the food vessels and the pictures in my mind .
i was so , when we were holding our send , and we started to dream of the camera .
they were inspired by us .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it , to make magic rather than kill .
and i started illustrate books with 16 .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling , the readers in the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s bringing pictures and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
the storytelling of storytelling used more sense .
but what do we do with that ?
i &apos;m just going to go to the street , a interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s &quot; let your fingers go on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s what this box is : &quot; this box is the -- &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to get a character in the book .
and again , a letter is down to me -- and the ipad knows by gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the child in me is really excited about such opportunities .
i talked a lot about magic .
i mean , i don &apos;t mean a magician and the dragon , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies found in a glass , and i always found very exciting .
so you have to go out here and go out the ipad and fireflies go backwards .
and the light is the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single light .
and so every book and the world is going to be a little sketchy that i &apos;m going to get here to the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
the whole maps had always been , but these maps were static .
this map grows and it goes to the orientation in the rest of the book .
it turns out it &apos;s also in other places .
i &apos;m going in here .
it &apos;s important to me , to make something that is more important , but also very much more sophisticated .
this is the most popular .
we &apos;ve all heard of the design of the world , and how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the most successful of the world ?
the poor people were caught up thousands of years in northern chambers , in a ancient book book .
and we bring them back , in an contemporary story for children .
a story that projects with new issues , like the most cosmopolitan .
the theme of the last 10 years , a big problem of the last 10 years , is that kids in their rooms are sitting on their rooms , without out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in a context of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search , you have to go out and collect the camera of the ipads of the brain .
as a child , i had collections of the steel of the , rocks , and the currents .
somehow , the children don &apos;t do it anymore .
this is the return of return . you have to go out , to make a picture of a flower , and tag it .
in another chapter , you have to have a piece of light , and tag .
so , you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can put online .
a child in london shows the picture of a football system , and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i saw a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network about a digital collection of photos that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities that are magic to connect the world and technology .
the next book we &apos;re planning to do is use a interaction of the ipads , and using the video of augmented reality , and it looks at a animation of pulses that appear on a plant before the house .
and in a place , the screen is filling up with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the laser , you throw away and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the natural forces of technology are coming closer and in the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and we &apos;re closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really a very extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in prison houses , prisons or a family .
i spend most of my time with the social weakest in the most responsible and in places that there are very much hopelessness .
here at ted , to see , and hearing how stimulating this is , i &apos;ve given a lot of power .
in the short time here , i got a clear thing : ted has a identity .
you can say things that have influence the world .
and sometimes , if something comes about ted , it gets meaning and force that otherwise didn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we saw some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher &apos;s own important , but that &apos;s the words of a dedicated teacher &apos;s own concern .
you can do good , as a doctor , but you can do more than a doctor .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional household household , which was dominated by a matriarch , and this matriarch was my grandmother .
she was a big , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every single book .
it was also the beginning of many human differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a prison .
their parents were born in the 1940s in virginia as a slave .
she was born in papua papua and the experience of slavery shaped her view very much .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met them as a little boy , she came to me and gave me a staff .
they put me so stuck that i couldn &apos;t breathe . then they took me .
one or two hours later , if i came to her , she came to me and said , &quot; do you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said no , &quot; no &quot; i said , &quot; i said , &quot; yes , i said , &quot; yes , she would put me in quiet .
and she was something that made it , that you &apos;d always wanted to be in your near way .
the only problem with this was that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins went around everywhere .
i remember , i have to have eight or nine , that i woke up one morning and went into living rooms . all my cousins went around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room and i &apos;m staring at me .
first of all , i thought that was a game .
i saw her and smiles , but she looked very serious .
and that was 15 or 20 minutes . then she stood up and came to me . she took me in the hand and said , &quot; come on , &quot; come on . you and i have to talk . &quot;
i remember it as if it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out to outside and said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t have it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down me and saw me . she said , &quot; i want you to know i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me just three things , &quot; you &apos;ve got to be more restrained . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i &apos;m going to be able to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby and you must have to take care of them . &quot;
i scraped my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
then she said , &quot; next , i &apos;m going to be able to do the right thing , &quot; and if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing .
i thought , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you need to promise me is , &quot; you never have to drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old south and i have a brother , who &apos;s a year older and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , my brother came home and brought this kind of a beer to my sister and i went to the forest and went to the forest .
we &apos;re just going around there like otherwise .
then he took a quick beer and offered my sister &apos;s father , and she took me , and then she offered me to one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . already , you &apos;re just ok . i don &apos;t want to do beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do it . we do this today , you &apos;re doing anything else we do .
i had what i had , your sister , and go , a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . just make your mind . &quot;
my brother &apos;s staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? well , what &apos;s going on . &quot;
and then he looked into the face and he said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t always do you crazy because of entertainment with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells everybody that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
i should probably not do that .
this is probably going to transmit public gas .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m not going to drink a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s a lot of the time , i say , because identity means power .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people about us things that they don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they could not .
of course my grandmother would tell all of her grandchildren , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was in prison during the prison department .
my uncle died in the wild of the disease .
and she believed that this is the themes that we need to take care of .
i tried to say something about our system system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1945 , 300,000 people were in southern kenya and prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest annual rate of the world .
seven million people are released on the verge or with inefficient modes of music .
i think that the world &apos;s most fundamental has changed our world .
in social , and black parts of the population , liberals are suffering and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three people black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , in the prison , and in the prison , or with a prehistoric computer program .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles across philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of all black young men , in prison , on the left , or with a prehistoric computer program .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have to do with the power of food , it &apos;s also being emitted by poverty .
we have a court system that you &apos;re treating a system much better when you &apos;re rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
wealth , not pumps , it affects the result .
but we seem to be very pleased with that .
a policy of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a couple of other things that are happening .
my home state of alabama is permanently breaking the vote when they &apos;re forbidden .
here today , in alabama today , 34 percent of the male black population is permanently lost their voices .
we predict that in 10 years the average of the population of civic growth is going to be so high as the average of the oil of the ocean .
the silence is a little bit more .
i live children .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world , convicted of children &apos;s death , convicted of the prison .
in this country , there are a living system of living technology without form of life .
we &apos;ve got a lot of time running .
the only country in the world .
i represent people in the wild business .
the death penalty question is a really interesting question .
we believe because you &apos;ve taught us that the real question is : is a human being made , for a person , to die for a person ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other view is not : does anybody deserve a crime to death , but : did we deserve it to kill ?
i find this fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
on nine people that we &apos;ve executed , one that we &apos;ve been executed is that we have a innocent , which was released and out of death row .
an amazing thing . one of nine innocent .
i find this fascinating .
we would never let anyone fly with a plane if for nine planes , the open , a crash .
but somehow we do it , from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question whether we &apos;re right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m african-american my students african-american history . i talk about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , the time for the end of the reconstruction , to the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
but for the pregnant , in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people have had to fear fear .
or bombs .
it was fear of terror , which shaped their lives .
these older people now come to me and say , &quot; mr , wal-mart , you &apos;re talking to you , you &apos;re saying , you &apos;re going to be told that you should stop saying that we &apos;re going to do it for the first time in our nation
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after that terrorism , of course , the mutilated and decades of the world &apos;s caregivers came to worship and apartheid .
and yet , in our country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what our actions are in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly walking together .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to get us to the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the mutilated ones are not to overcome the willingness without the willingness to the truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve kept some talks in germany about death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply disturbing , you &apos;re talking to you . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , it can never give them more . &quot;
it was a little silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever kill for the systematic people .
it would be a lot of us , consciously , and most of us are in people . &quot;
i thought about it .
as it would feel , in a world where german state had been able to live in people , especially if there were a lot of jews in the middle of a lot of jewish jews .
it would be excruciatingly .
it would be a lot of a car .
and yet , here in this country , in the united states , we &apos;re going to get people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted of death , to death , and we &apos;re going to be more likely to be , and the green , when the
and yet there &apos;s this mental disconnection .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with this difficult topics , the positive and wonderful things are affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities of suffering , abuse , abuse , apartheid , apartheid .
i &apos;m important to unite both .
because we ultimately talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment , to be able to be in a complex world .
for me , this is what makes it happen to be able to think about the poor , and to talk about the poor , the spaceshipone , who never will be at ted .
but think about a way that is embedded in our own lives .
we all have to believe in the end of the things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re also rational , so we appreciate the intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just coming from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief of the way that they are .
it &apos;s this kind of high-tech , which i think is driving us , not just being open to all the light and the things that are the dark and the most powerful and the dark and the most powerful .
preity ornish : the great killer politician , once
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe against oppression , we wanted to do everything . but what we needed most needed was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be a free guidance , and to be witness . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i think is also the most powerful thing to do .
there &apos;s no gap to technology and design that allows us to be very human , and as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears , and injustice , and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity is a lot more of us than if we don &apos;t care about it .
it &apos;s going to touch them deeply .
as a young lawyer , i &apos;m a great privilege to meet pink parks .
woman &apos;s and back , and again , once back to the ted community , where she was going to go back to the other , you have two of the oldest friends of the elders who had these older women , who had the most educated , an incredible
so these women were meeting and they were just talking .
and then , when i was , woman was then crying down and said , &quot; well , &quot; aw , woman park in the city . we want to talk .
do you want to come in and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very happy . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just heard .
it was always so inspiring , so the way it was .
one day i sat there and heard these women , and after a few hours , woman was told to me , &quot; well , now , you know , i &apos;m going to tell you what the initiative are right now .
what do they try to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go to injustice .
and people want to help people pay innocent .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the climate system .
we want to eliminate in the lifestyle of the world &apos;s life , without making a difference for children .
we want to do something about death penalty .
we want to lower the number of death .
we want to eradicate the world . &quot;
i thought my usual talk , and after that , she looked at me and said , &quot; well , the word . &quot;
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
then , ms. , he was going to get to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore , you have to be very , very reactive . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be the ted community .
we need to make ways of putting ourselves together , and we have to make this challenge , this fear .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a few very simple things .
that we all are more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every human being .
if somebody lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes a little bit , it &apos;s not just a lonely one .
even who kills someone , not only a murderer .
and because this is , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that needs to respect the law .
i also think that in many parts of this country , and with safety in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think that in many places , the opposite of poverty is the opposite of justice .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so stimulating , we &apos;re not measured at the end of our technology , not at the things we &apos;re developing , not in our intellect and minds .
finally , a society will not be measured as they treated their rich and powerful and privileged , but to how they deal with the poor , the child rates , the pygmies .
because in this context , we just start to understand the truly amazing things that make us happen .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story to finish .
sometimes i press too much .
i &apos;m going to get tired of all of us .
sometimes they &apos;re tagging on our thinking of our thinking , in the very important way .
i spent these kids who were convicted of very hard disabled .
i go to the kitchen store and go to a client that may be 13 or 14 years old , and the age of a crime is supposed to be a personal age .
then i wonder , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn somebody into something that he &apos;s not ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night , i stayed too long and thought , my goodness , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he has to have a lot of time .
right , the judges , the judge has a lot of the time .
you should also want to do that .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think more right , i started working on a post .
i had a 14 year-old young young young young boy than clients .
and i started with this , and the headline said , &quot; promised my arms , 14 black customers like a privileged , white , white , white , white , white . &quot;
i said , i explained that error of the computer is the most powerful and the police and the police .
there was a crazy line about that that in this country , nothing is more conductive , that there &apos;s still a mess .
the next morning , i woke up and i didn &apos;t know if i was just dreaming that crazy , or actually , i was writing it .
and i didn &apos;t just write him , but i was sent to the court .
a few months away , and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to the court and that crazy case .
i went into the car , and i was really overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard , so painful .
and then i went out of my car and went to the stairs to the court .
when i was the staircase to the court , there was a elderly , black man , the janitors in the court .
and when he saw me , he came to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and gave me a celebration .
then he pushed me into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched something very deep in me , identity , the ability to support every single one , to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i went to the street .
and once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. fischer , put it in this crazy term ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to debate .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
that i had written these crazy things .
and the business workers came in and the office workers and office workers .
in the most competitive , the most popular was full of people who were angry that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
i saw my thumb , and i looked down , and i go .
he always saw through the window and he could hear the whole thing .
he went and down .
finally , this old black man came with a very senior , very senior , and sat straight behind me , almost on the street floor .
10 minutes later , the judge announced a break .
during the break , a computer company came in , which was the janitors in the prison .
this is the place that ran over the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the prison ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he saw the most popular , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to say , &quot; i &apos;m here to say that boy &apos;s not going to be the end . give it a goal
i came to ted because i think that many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far more profound , but that justice is the case of justice .
we &apos;re not fully developing as humans , unless we don &apos;t care about human rights and we don &apos;t care about human rights .
that our survival is all connected to the survival of each individual .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity , and our justice , compassion , justice .
and i &apos;m particularly interested in this one of you who just see that , just say , lose the goal of the eyes . don &apos;t give it up .
they have seen this one , this community , an obvious wish , and to help them and to do something .
what can we do ?
and so , the instructor &apos;s gardens : well , there &apos;s opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a mountain that &apos;s in this spring , which is about , actually , a effort to do , actually , a effort of business , which is going to be flowing in the politics of punishment .
here , in california , you will be a billion dollars for the death penalty , a billion dollars for a death penalty company .
and yet , 46 percent of all the oil companies don &apos;t end with an outrageous .
56 percent of all the time are coming in front of the court .
there &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
this is a little bit of a trivial notion of investing in the money , and security is to invest in more educational and safety .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the most powerful news is the most powerful in america .
this fact is going to be a lot of the increase in the increased oil industry .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
now , in fact , the number of people in the world are not very changed .
most of the most popular in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of the world &apos;s class .
it was the most popular pennsylvania car in pennsylvania .
so the dramatic numbers are coming up with the prisoners .
we have a point of the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have &quot; the &quot; s &quot; , which is the people who are going to bring people behind grid vehicles for a drug company , for a drug , for the theft of the good , rather than that you force them to make things back .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a food system , not less .
and i think our current world &apos;s current is not helping us .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
and they &apos;ve actually got a string string here , and they &apos;ve actually brought a string of string .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
my death is a permanent increase with a more active person .
: famine in somalia . 3 : spray the police .
four : 13,000 , five : dangerous , dangerous .
six : social degradation . 7 : 65 .
eight : six : 00 speaker .
different speakers . mass weapons .
recession . gridlock . egypt . syria . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could be the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative topics because our minds are exactly causing attention to these issues .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this .
every second , our senses will catch a lot more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first leave for all the information is a part of our temporal lobes , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early team , our main team .
it &apos;s a conversation and the whole information on the search for any proposition in the environment of the environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to keep looking for negative news .
and the old adage , when it &apos;s going to go up , the demand is very true .
now , with all our digital devices that we have seven days the week , 24 hours a day , all these negative messages is not a miracle , it &apos;s not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is going to be worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the enormous progress that we &apos;ve made in the last century is that we &apos;ve made a series of forces in the last century , so strong that it &apos;s possible to create us in the next three decades , a world of abundance .
well , i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have a big problem -- climate crisis , water , water and energy -- we &apos;ve already got .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at doing problems in very long times , but they eventually get to overcome .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century so that we can predict the development .
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , which has tripled the agricultural land of inflation .
child mortality has a tenth of a tenth of child mortality .
and that &apos;s the fact that the most popular , the more powerful , and cost to reduce a pair of glasses .
steve pinker has shown us that we currently live in a very peaceful time of the world &apos;s population .
and according to charles singers , the most popular news is up in the last 130 years of 80 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we keep our expectations constantly on .
in fact , we have new poverty .
remember that a large percentage of americans who live under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toilets , fruits , the air , air phones , and cars , and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the world &apos;s most popular , could never have dreamed of luxury luxury .
the basis of a lot of it is technologies , and they grow these things .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that becomes information technology is going to be big jumps to the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the most recent , and the most 12 to 24 months .
so this is about a million times in your pocket , about a million times less and half times faster than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how smooth she goes -- in good times , war or peace , recession , depression , depression and engineering .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
it &apos;s slowed down for none of our big problems .
and despite their logarithmic , the left on the left , they &apos;re going up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to all of them .
&quot; the &quot; s , &quot; something that my friends call &quot; the &quot; rockett &quot; , sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers , that allow the personal production to democratize our planet , synthetic biology , fuel , hydrogen and food , digital medicine , fuel and
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm supercomputer in &quot; jeopardy ? &quot;
that was big .
i &apos;ve been looking for the newspapers and looking for the best headlines that i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson &apos;s human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that these artificial intelligence has been available every owner of a brain .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i started a new university here , which is &quot; singularity university &quot; .
we bring our students all these technologies to work with how they can be used , and to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students , businesses , products and services that can affect the lives of billions of people in a decade .
think about it , a group of students can affect life from billions of people .
30 years ago , this had been very compelling .
today we can integrate in dozens of companies that have done this .
if i think about making abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for each planet on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about making a potential of goods .
scarcity is a finite , and technology is a finite force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of deregulation in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of the king of the house .
and the soldiers were getting out of the street , shiny , even got a lot of credit .
but the king of the king of the king of the world got a lot of the king .
aluminum was at this time that the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and platinum .
this is why the dome was made from aluminum , from aluminum .
although aluminum refrigeration of the oil system is not going to come up as a pure metal .
it &apos;s connected through oxygen and a plastic .
but then the technology of the internet technology was developed and made a production so cheap that we use it with our environmental rights .
and then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we think about the long-term movement today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet of the world with a more energy system than we use every year .
16 square of the energy , all of a sudden , is published in the surface of the earth .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve been able to reduce the cost for solar growth in india , to 50 percent of the most powerful -- compared to 17 rupees in comparison .
the cost for solar resources in the last year is 50 percent .
last month , this has published a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the united states , solar has six cents per capita average , in comparison to 15 cents per national average .
and if we have an excess energy system , we &apos;re going to have water in the abundance .
let &apos;s talk about the future of space .
do you remember when carl sagan was the most born of 1990 , when it was on saturn &apos;s ocean , back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it ?
&quot; a &quot; a &quot; a &quot; blue blue trail . &quot;
because we live on a computer scanner .
we live on a planet that is covered by 70 percent of water .
yes , it &apos;s the kind of water tanks , two percent , and we &apos;re fighting to 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new food systems on the way , the way it &apos;s .
and from a conversation today with dean kamen , one of the innovators of doing it , i want to share with you something -- he gave me permission -- his permission -- his favorite , the &quot; the &quot; machine &quot; , and the many of you may have
it can generate a thousand liters clean water a day -- whether saltwater , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents per liter .
the president of coca-cola has just been a big , big , big , big , a big set of units in developing countries .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola will apply this technology globally in the entire planet in the entire planet .
this is a natural innovation that &apos;s now known today .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
you mean , you know , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent of the mobile phone in the developing world to the end of 2013 .
just think that a computer company with a mobile phone in the middle of kenya has a better kind of a car that has a better animal than president reagan .
and if you look at your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowing and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the abundance of no one ever could have predicted .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you have and i spent a thousand dollars spent -- gps , the , and photograph , libraries of books and music , technology of books and music , technology to medical imaging -- now , literally , and cheaper in
and the best thing about this is perhaps what we expect in health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure of the pleasure that &apos;s called &quot; $ 10 million &quot; 10 million miles of &quot; chemo x prize . &quot;
we &apos;re asking teams all over the world , and all these technologies in a mobile phone , that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equipped with ai , because it &apos;s equipped with ai , you can test it or test your brain .
and to win , the device has to have a better diagnosis than a team of physicians .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of the people who have a lot of health care and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
if this device was sequenced , or a computer , which is not known , it &apos;s called the disease rate of the disease , and it &apos;s a pandemic of your outbreak .
but now , the biggest force that leads us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the world &apos;s military .
and by the way , the biggest consumer policy against a population population is a better education and food in all the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people online .
until 2020 , we climb a floating satellite of two in five billion internet users .
three billion new heads we &apos;ve never heard before , the global communication will be connecting .
what do these people need ?
what will they consume ? what will they want ?
and instead of ecological gridlock , i see one of the greatest economic practices of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that are going to flow into global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier , and they &apos;re trained to be trained by the design of the world , and by doing that , they &apos;re going to have the ability to use 3d printers and &quot; the &quot; s computing , &quot; and so much more
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated members of the world &apos;s population are bringing us ?
as it would be with a sentence , it never had been true before .
how about it , the oppressed , wherever they are , a voice to pay attention to the attention and create change , for the first time ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
how about the internet that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i learned by the x prize is that little teams that get through passion and focus are capable of creating extraordinary things , things that could only create large companies and governments in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might know .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to evolve .
and the behavior of his behavior is we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the most important .
so , this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university and so on .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online .
and it turns out that today the human pattern recognition is better than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked at who &apos;s the best world &apos;s best , this was not a big , not a computer designer , it was somebody from england , and it was a woman who was working in the day as a assistant in a magazine
ladies and gentlemen , what &apos;s enormous to me is that there are more faith in our future , that we have more power than individuals to put us up the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a nuclear system .
we have the capital of the oil system .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work online to solve the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s needed .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to have a little bit of a health program to do a little bit of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical medical and i &apos;m .
and maybe i &apos;m a long enough time in business than i can give it a piece of my own wrong word to give this .
but before i &apos;m going to talk to you about the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re close to the world cup , and we &apos;re moving to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of a great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; the &quot; s &quot; seems soon , and it turns around statistics and to use a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to get to a statistics that i hope that most of you have heard of .
it &apos;s the most powerful of the internet .
we talk about a 300 if a bat is 300 .
that means that the player is safe to beat three of the 10 beats .
this is the ball in the window , and he &apos;s going to come up , he won &apos;t catch , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball to the first base , it didn &apos;t have done it and the shelves was in safety .
three from 10 .
do you know how to call a car factory in a wooden league baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a more serious one .
you know how to do a laser call ?
this is a guy who &apos;s safe from 10 .
so , as ted williams is a , the last ted student -- the last summer league of baseball , who was a regular season over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to the world of medicine , which i feel more comfortable or maybe a little less likely to do , or maybe a little less than that i &apos;ve talked about .
imagine you have a design and you &apos;ve gotten a double and you &apos;ve got to put it in a car , which is 400 in terms of the car .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine life in a certain remote area and you have a beloved people with clogged and her favorite , and your favorite of the water , which is a little bit of a plastic , which is the most responsible at the time of the water .
but , but do you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better that year . it &apos;s on the board branch .
and she &apos;s going to beat a laser .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the most like a parent or a nurse or a nurse or a nurse or a baby company , a computer company , should be a laser , a plastic ball ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody knows all the medicine , which is a good surgeon or a doctor or a doctor .
but what we do is we &apos;re in each of them , including me , in the world with a really perfect thing .
never make a mistake , no one does it , but the details of the details should be done .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was a marilyn student .
in high school , a school school said that brian was learning to learn for a blood test .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little little school of school in the early league of the toronto general hospital , and i learned from here .
i learned everything .
in my favorite school , i learned the origins and the tail every single stick , every branch of a stick , which is from the aorta , obscure and ordinary .
i even knew the most popular to classify the most powerful news of the street .
and i &apos;ve got more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i was going to cut up with a little bit of a police drum .
and i left medical school with the impression that i knew if i knew everything and knew everything , or at least as much as possible , as close as possible , that i &apos;m immune to mistakes .
and it worked for a time until i met a little woman &apos;s printer .
i &apos;m going to be in toronto here in toronto as a woman to me in toronto , and i was brought in the prison printer of the hospital .
i was a tour of the training layer at the time of the service .
and it was my assignment when the most popular advice was looking at the most important of the book .
and there &apos;s feedback in my own business .
i studied ms. printer and she was in the book of a book .
and when i listened to her , she was making sound sounds .
and when i was a breast , i could hear a little bit of sound on both sides , and i told you that she was suffering under the heart failure .
this is a condition in which the heart is failing , instead of pumps the entire blood , and it &apos;s a part of the blood in the lung , and it &apos;s going to be filling up this , so the most the design industry came .
and that was not a hard diagnosis of the way .
i put them and made me care .
i gave her a demonstration . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call water pills , water pills , so they &apos;re going to be blowing the liquid .
and over a time of a year , two hours , she started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
i actually made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my favorite story .
i didn &apos;t take the track and i did what i should have been , which was a call of my favorite , to be able to have a chance to have a picture .
and he knew it was able to have the possibility of her being able to get more information .
maybe i did it with good reason .
i couldn &apos;t be the most popular doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so to take responsibility that i was so , and i would be able to worry about my patients without having to contact it .
my second mistake was worse .
and i sent them home , i &apos;m a quiet voice in my , trying to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . do not . &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s so hard to do that in the way i asked the nurse , which was about woman &apos;s printer , &quot; do you believe that in order to be right when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and he said in a way , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to be good . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
so i stole the most selective and a ambulance and a foster and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this nagging feeling in my stomach .
but i kept working on .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , and i went to the parking parking , and i went to drive the car for a lot of the car , when i did something that i didn &apos;t do .
i went home to the street &apos;s office .
and there was another nurse who was not seeing the sister &apos;s s to the wife &apos;s hat , but to me , a different three words , and i &apos;m afraid of three words that i know .
other medical doctors fear , but the critical issue is very special because we just see the patients as so strongly .
the three words loud : remember ?
&quot; remember the patient that they &apos;d thought about home ? &quot;
the nurse was asked .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular kind of business .
so she was back .
she was back and she died .
about an hour after that she came home after i sent her home , she collapsed and the family called 911 . the most successful , the air soldiers brought them back to the front of a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous one .
they &apos;re barely breathing and was blue .
the most prolific thing was all the strands .
they gave her their credit .
they closed them on the front of the road .
i was shocked and to the inner police .
and i travel through this rollercoaster because they came to the intensive care system , and i hoped they would recover .
and after two , three days realized that she would never again be again .
she had no more of a more empathic metric .
their family gathered together .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , they began to get the baby &apos;s license .
the day of day , she &apos;s going to go -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say that you &apos;re never hearing the names of those things .
and that was the first time i learned this .
the next couple of weeks i did , and i learned to myself , the first time the unhealthy shame , which exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isolated , not the way of healthy shame that you feel because you can &apos;t talk about the
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret of the best friend , although this one on the top of a car &apos;s and you get caught and the best friend of a thing , and it &apos;s a terrible discussion when you get the bad
if you do it , and you never do the mistakes again .
this is the kind of ted genome .
the unhealthy way i talk about is that it &apos;s a very unfair way of doing it .
it &apos;s the one who says that it &apos;s not what you did , but you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t in my favorite process , he was very dear .
he spoke with the family and i &apos;m sure he &apos;s going to put the bands of the bands and safe , that i wouldn &apos;t be sued .
but i asked myself to ask these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the most popular ? why do i send them home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a dumb mistake ?
why went on to medicine ?
slowly , it &apos;s done .
i started feeling better .
and then on a day , a hole , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke and i could tell myself i could feel better .
and i was with me that if i doubled my efforts to perfection and never even get a mistake , the voice could be dismissed .
and she did .
and i kept working .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the prison shop in a hospital hospital in a hospital park north of toronto , and i &apos;m a 25 year-old man with a medical doctor .
it was a lot of time and i put it in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked at the most popular and it was a little pink pink .
and i gave him an prescription for penicillin and sent him away .
and yet , when he went out of the door , he showed his head on his chest .
two days later , i came to my next ted project and asked me to speak to a conversation in her office .
and she said three words : remember , you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the ted system ? &quot;
it turns out he turned a laser .
he had potentially a potentially more powerful disease called the iliad .
you can google the google , but it &apos;s not infection of the internet &apos;s top , but the top of the top of the body is getting the open of the water .
and fortunately , he died .
he got a few days of college and recovered , a few days later .
and i went back through the same kind of comic , and the self-doubt of the shame , and the self-doubt , i felt free and went back to work until it comes back and back and back .
in a computer , i have a little bit of a professional arms .
there &apos;s a lot of time to think about it , especially if you think that you work in a hospital that &apos;s just 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and there was no substitute in their treatment .
i thought he had a thought of that .
i &apos;m going to take the credit of the kidney , when it was no more balanced , my colleague was stuck in the bottom of the patient &apos;s rights , and i called the surgeons in the lower right-hand sector .
the other had strong diarrhea .
i &apos;m going to get a lot of the time to go to him and asked my colleagues to speak .
and he did and he was in the right at the right the bottom sector , called the surgeons .
in both cases , it was a lot of time and it was good .
both cases of mine , i &apos;m standing on the side of it .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which is what many of my colleagues say , but remain nonsense .
some of my favorite projects happened in the last five years .
alone , and no support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t end with my mistakes and talk about them , if i can do the quiet voice that i can tell you , what really happened to me , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes , so that they don &apos;t make the same ?
if i was in a room -- like now , i &apos;m not going to know what you think about me .
when did you hear the last time of someone who &apos;s talked about the ted system about the world &apos;s worth of cancer ?
oh yes , you go to a cocktail party and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about your own mistakes .
if i had a room with colleagues , and to ask their immediate support , and they started telling them what i &apos;m telling you , i would probably not get to the end of the second story before they really would be uncomfortable , and they would be able
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues , that a child &apos;s office would have lost the wrong leg , then you believe me , i would have trouble to look at it in the eyes .
this is the system we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of errors .
it &apos;s a system that is two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do it . those who are not doing sleep deprivation and the good results that are demanding the bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response like antibodies that attack people .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we are to borrow those who are thriving , we have a secure system .
but there are two problems in this .
in my about 20 years of medical school and journalism , i have a personal medical study , and i &apos;ve made a personal medical study to make all kinds of things i do for the toronto star i wrote for the toronto star .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely more nuanced .
we &apos;re working in a system in which every day is either a false or wrong , or a false , or a false , and the more unequal , and the most unequal , cause the locals and the most common .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians die of the disease .
in the united states , the institute of medicine has been brought up with 100,000 .
both of these are strong , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as well as we should .
and is the most popular .
in a field of medicine that the medical wisdom is doubling all two to three years , we can &apos;t keep anywhere .
sleep sleep is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error , so that we can take a perfect diagnostic for a patient with chest chest cancer .
then i take the same patient with the same patient , making it a little bit of a light and give it a little bit more lightweight and a little bit of a breath to get a handle and suddenly have a little bit of a mess with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same way .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things like that .
and my patients are not cars ; they &apos;re not telling me their symptoms always in the same way .
all of this is inevitable .
so if you take the system like i was taught , and all the most sophisticated things that i &apos;ve been taught , and all the most prolific things , it &apos;s no longer left .
and you know the most popular about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , white , black , black , i have the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everybody from the most responsible to the street of the computer , &quot; this is my worst mistake , blah ,
and then their horizons expand , they &apos;re just coming down the head , and they &apos;re going to look down and eat them , and they &apos;re going to get to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes that i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what you need is a environment that you can put in the position .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new word is a human being , knowing about his humanity , accepted , it &apos;s not a pride to make it , but it &apos;s all about learning to learn that it can be passed out .
it shares your experience with other people .
they supported when they speak to their mistakes .
and she shows other people whose mistakes , not about the most cosmopolitan , but in a supportive family , all of them benefit .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture that recognizes that people are putting the system with life and when that is , then people are doing mistakes from time to time .
so that the system is going to be developed to make the system that makes it easier to make people inevitable and make it really beneficial , and also also supporting the spaces , supporting spaces where everybody is watching the health care , and that &apos;s what makes the
my name is brian goldman rouge .
i &apos;m the new doctor .
i &apos;m a person . i do mistakes .
but i &apos;m working on the other hand , but i &apos;m trying to learn best to give it to others .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding me , but i can live with it .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny little idea .
it &apos;s about the most populous .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories about the time to use the time .
the first story is charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he &apos;s in 1965 .
you might think he &apos;s wearing the piano , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he collected fish .
he described one of them as a very common &quot; usually . &quot;
it was a computer factory .
until the &apos; 80s , it was breaking in great style .
now , he &apos;s listed on the red list .
and we heard a lot of times from the galapagos or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the most popular you &apos;re still describing as pristine .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is a different concept that &apos;s going to be put in the world &apos;s worth of view .
because i &apos;ve experienced a lagoon when i was watching a lagoon in 1971 .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad blast , and i was convinced that i was really not there .
it was my first blast pump .
as you see , the lagoon of palms and some of the trees were running out of the nest .
there were a lot of the news of about 20 inches , a subset of the design of the world &apos;s office .
the fisheries of these predatory forests were very productive and the fishermen lived well , and they were doing good at ghana in the upper sea .
when i returned 27 years later , the fish was blown down at half its size .
adult measurements are five centimeters .
they were genetically modified .
it still was fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had happiness , even though .
so it doesn &apos;t change anything , and yet everything changed .
my third little story told me about my favorite story of the most popular of southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- more to the dawn of the 1960s -- the european europe .
and the media companies that were already growing over 100 fish started to get the industrial fishing of this relatively ugly ship .
i went to this and we did the whole entire entire city of the entire entire ocean , and especially in the south african sea .
we had no words for what we started .
i know that it was the reason of the ocean .
90 percent of our most powerful were sponges , other animals who are connected to the reason .
the largest part of the fish that the small dots there are on the rubble , the most cosmopolitan , were the most salient .
basically , the reason of the ocean was thrown up and then thrown back .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you &apos;ll get an essay and start with the work of the labor .
the reason is going to change . from that case -- a hard reason or soft coral is going to be a little bit of a soft crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we started a living life .
she wasn &apos;t drowning .
then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat it well .
in fact , this mountain is accumulated by the rubble every time , every time they go in areas , they &apos;re never going to fish .
it &apos;s not going to be recorded .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we &apos;re betting our online level of the new level , and we don &apos;t call us in memory , which was there .
if you &apos;re going to get it out , this is what happens .
on the y-axis , a few good things : biodiversity , number of the most powerful , the green of your country , the green of your country .
it &apos;s changing with time . it changes , because for people , they are very , of course .
every generation looks at the images that you can take in the beginning of your conscious life as a standard and it &apos;s going to be able to get it .
the difference is then being seen as loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
there can be a sequence of changes .
and at the end , they just want to get the most popular remains .
that &apos;s what &apos;s largely our goal .
we want to get things that are gone or things that are not more like them .
you could think that the problem of people who were certainly being in the world in the world , they killed animals and they were killing them for a few generations , which they did .
because obviously a animal that there was very often , just rarely , before it &apos;s going to be the same .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of raw animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not going to be a big loss .
and we &apos;re focusing on the big animals , and the ocean is the big fish .
they &apos;re going to be less rare because we &apos;re catching them .
and the time , there &apos;s a little bit of fish left and we think that &apos;s the most powerful .
the question is , why people accept that .
well , because it &apos;s not that it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
they &apos;re going to confirm it because the evidence , as you &apos;re in a previous form of shape , are not like you would like to express the evidence .
for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of a computer project , which is a big scale of the project , can &apos;t be used , or not , or not , usually , because it &apos;s not a scientific thing .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in educated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this is the enormous amount of role that can play a marine reserve .
because in marine marine terms , we &apos;re basically going to be the past .
we &apos;re going to ask the past , which people can &apos;t understand because they have changed the world &apos;s rights and very low .
so , the people who see a marine reserve and the benefit of the view is that it allows you to reset your body .
what about the people who don &apos;t do that , because they don &apos;t have access -- people in the middle of the west for example ?
here , i think , i think the art and the movie may fill the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was a lot of time in front of it .
and the most popular and more of the world &apos;s mind is , you might remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think &quot; avatar &quot; if you think about why people were touched by this , besides the most powerful , why were they so touched by the most responsible , why were they so touched by the animal .
because it &apos;s something that has been lost in a way that &apos;s lost in a way .
so my only , the only one i &apos;m going to give you , is to go to cameron , so he &apos;s going to turn &quot; avatar ii . &quot;
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist century , you had to , if you had a typewriter , that in the government .
they also had to beat a sheet of a cockroach with a typewriter .
the reason that the government was able to track , where a text came from .
and they found a paper with a computer company , and they could discover the creator of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do something like this , and how much that would be replaced , and how much the freedom would be replaced .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
but if you buy a new computer project today , and you &apos;re buying a new world &apos;s leading , and a page , then this page has light yellow yellow , on every page , which is a very clear thing to do , and you can see the
this is what happens today .
and nobody seems to be a lot of noise .
and that was an example of what our governments are telling us about , the citizens , use the citizens .
and this is one of the three main types of people today that are existing .
let &apos;s look at what really happens in the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three main centers .
there are a lot of the data .
for example , here &apos;s mr. &apos;s favorite , and this is the gentleman &apos;s favorite , in ukraine .
and the motives of the internet skills are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use the energy skills to make a lot of money , a huge bunch of money .
there are several known cases of the oil of the , which is the money that they made through attacks .
this is a video of the cotton company in estonia .
this is alfred &apos;s film .
stephen watts .
so , the most powerful .
this is matthew anderson , who &apos;s the most powerful and so on and so on .
these people have come online to wealth , but they &apos;ve made it illegal by using the water supply to transport money from our bank bank , as we do our online online , or we &apos;re going to do a more online , or we &apos;re going to buy
the american intelligence agency two months ago , the swiss bank account by mr. sam gordon , and on this bank , were a failed million dollars , when it was frozen .
mr. gordon himself is on free feet , the shocker is unknown .
and i &apos;m going to argue that today we &apos;re becoming more likely to be victims of a food of a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will be even worse .
in the future , most crime will play online .
the second largest industrial industry we can observe today is not motivated by money .
they are motivated by something else -- protests , a belief , or through their audience .
and groups like anonymous are moved over the last 12 months and become one of the most successful at the field of the ocean .
so these are the three main points : criminals , who are doing it for money , the way they do , but the last group are nations , but the last group are nations , governments who lead the attacks .
there are cases of the way that we have .
it shows a piece of a piece of what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
and the truth is a very reactive of the netherlands -- or it was that .
the last fall , it had to scream out , because it was a bleeding .
somebody was hacked and had a lot of hacked system .
and last week in a meeting with dutch , i asked one of the senior people who had the question if he could make it possible for the most successful people .
and his answer was yes .
now , how do people die in a series of remote diseases like this ?
so , the most powerful is a water .
they sell out the water .
what do you do with the water ?
now , a certificate you need when you &apos;re having a website with a plastic company , for example , to build kerosene .
now we use all of them , or many of us , kerosene or a half of their competitors , but these services are particularly common in the state of state states like iran , where dissidents are using the foreign lottery , and they can be encrypted , they
but you can , if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign .
and so , hacking , and fake , and fake , attracted to the counter .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens in the case of the brain .
how about the arab spring and the things that are happening in egypt ?
now , egypt was thriving in april 2011 , 2011 , the headquarters of egyptian food , and they found a lot of records .
in these records , a folder was called &quot; the &quot; police &quot; .
and in this folder , notes of a native country were local company who sold the egyptian government a few programs that they were -- in very large scales -- all of the communication of egyptian citizens could sustain .
they had sold this program for inappropriate euro to the egyptian government .
the main system is right here .
so western governments provide governments to do with the people who can do their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , just a few weeks ago , the so-called two weeks ago , this was a rice officer , which was used by german , to be used to be their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be in a corporate citizen , it will be pretty much your phone .
but today we are far beyond that .
they tap their internet connection .
they use the tools like the most cosmopolitan to put their computers with a horses , to monitor their entire communication , their own , their whole communication , their cad scans .
so if we think about things like this , the obvious answer of people would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a good citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i don &apos;t hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy must be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we now , in 2011 , our governments are trust , but every right we &apos;re calling is that we &apos;re being emitted forever .
and trust us , trust us in a future , to a government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to deal with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the computer .
the first offshore , the first time , were made by optimists and a simple idea : durkheim from cement with the remaining measurements that fit .
the most quickly fast , very quickly , were the most powerful of the world &apos;s population .
they put us in the situation to build things larger than we , buildings , bridges , a stone after the other .
essentially , the most powerful thing was the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of this .
it &apos;s called &quot; automatically scientific rock . &quot;
and within less years , lego was in every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful building .
lego made it for all possible .
lego basically has the most basic , the building building of the world , and it made a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the same year , in the same year , the next revolution was announced , the next building building .
the transistor was a little bit of a little bit of a plastic that was static to us from a world of static , and it was something that was interactive to a world in everything that was interactive .
as the average of the , we allow the transistor to build much more complex , more complex chains , a stone after the other .
but there &apos;s a key transistor : the transistor was only for experts .
i personally accept that that the building building is a lot of the time for experts to get us to the experts and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab and i started exploring this idea of how to put the power in the engineers of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing the street .
let me show you how they work .
so , the electronic modules are electronic units that have specific function .
they &apos;re a light , light , sound , motor and sensor .
and the best thing about it is that they connect with magnets .
they &apos;re not going to sit around them .
the stones are the ones .
green is a copy of a brain , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange cord .
so everything you need to do is to connect a blue and a green one together and you can build very quickly , very quickly .
they add a blue one on a green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between and you have a little bit of a plastic structure .
take the switch out of a car , which is here , and you &apos;ve made a little bit of a little bit of light .
add this kind of extra effect to a more important effect and you &apos;ve made a laser system .
i &apos;ll stop that .
the simple play , it &apos;s actually a pretty powerful thing , is actually a pretty powerful thing .
instead of coding that you have to program , or you have to do a little bit of programming , you have to mix with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to accelerate the physical , or slow down , just turn it into this button and it does the momentum faster or slow .
the idea behind the street is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world in a field of rock .
lights , sound , more reflective , motors , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve spread to kids , and they &apos;re going to see them playing .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how you start to understand the electronics that you &apos;re in the everyday world and you don &apos;t learn in school .
like a computer , a computer system , or why the doors of the baby &apos;s doors are responding , or how to react to a ipod .
we also brought up with the oil system .
so we had a designer with no experience of any experience in electronic things that started playing with the material as a material .
here we see , with a paper , paper and water bottles , like the water cloud ...
a few weeks ago , we took the street to risd , and gave them some designers that had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; do what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a little bit of a business .
but wait , this is really my favorite story .
it &apos;s a hummer from play-doh , fear in the darkness .
for those of you , a more material , was a different material , electronics just became another material .
and we want to make this material available for all available .
so , it &apos;s open source .
you can go to the website , all the main prints and make them .
we want the world of creators , the inventor , the contributors , for the people we live in , that interactive world , we heard about it .
so , pull out and start to invent it .
thank you .
