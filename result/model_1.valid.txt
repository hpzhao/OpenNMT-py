now , why does this matter for human health ?
here &apos;s a graph of the north of dolphins in 1919 bay .
and i remember sitting on my desk , and i thought , &quot; now i know it . what a great scientific discovery . &quot; but it was so awful .
they &apos;re always closed around the world and increasingly closed from the same reason , and i think that we should let it go .
at first i showed you how much we have the ecosystem of monterey bay , and the most common and all kinds of problems .
the -- the street -- the car -- the car .
about the same time he asked his mother , &quot; do you know the book of michael &apos;s book ? &quot;
we really really had scared .
craig here is moving the head .
you saw the skeleton .
we also have this ability .
it &apos;s our modern way of a little bit about a little bit about the benefits , but i think we should recognize what price .
clay shirky , this great thing of all of the individual , has the premise that &apos;s been asked to be asked to be found on the top of this wonderful way .
today , there are so many new foundations that are highly dispersed and investments that people together , together for a goal , in a larger context .
and i &apos;m hopeful , because not only is the philanthropy organized , and other big parts of social media , and business business is doing business as usual .
i &apos;m in this photograph , i &apos;m standing on my office . it &apos;s in my office , because i &apos;ve always been a mystic connection to these two men , i &apos;ve never seen them .
my own research to mobile phones and the computer &apos;s that 80 percent of all calls are actually going to four people in the process of four . 80 percent .
whenever you have a moment , immediately you &apos;re going to share with each other .
and with the modern bureaucracy , a very rational approach , where there was a clear disconnect between the private environment and the public environment .
we &apos;re worried that texting , sms , facebook , the most powerful intimacy , but the most powerful research is how to promote the most profound relationships to help love love like remoteness and food levels .
one of the things we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed several vehicles -- is , as we believe , the first autonomous design system of the world .
for example , the brain &apos;s brain tends to create a lot of alpha waves .
no challenging task .
at the time , the taxpayer spends about $ 60,000 in the year to send a human prison .
their family lives for eight generations in a city called the west virginia .
yes .
we can create these local markets and incentives to use the tools to use more than commodities for manufacturing .
and we should be investing in it .
and he sometimes won , you don &apos;t think it &apos;s a little bit of a football clinic in los angeles -- a reason to love l.a. -- in the 1940s .
i started to help my company to help communities use their existing potential to improve the entire quality of life of their people .
and before you don &apos;t even have kids , you &apos;re not going to understand what i mean . &quot;
these deaf people are discovering in adulthood , &quot; community &quot; for themselves .
it always takes time .
real guilt is just a person &apos;s worth of a person , and someone with syndrome is not a person . &quot;
to the people who are not more , it &apos;s not far more .
but i found that i &apos;ve been born the kids i &apos;m born , like i love a life without they don &apos;t want to imagine .
he wouldn &apos;t get out of his legs .
i come from a privileged family . i &apos;ve been lucky .
it &apos;s about two weeks old . and there are .
this is beginning to start . my son , dimitri -- that &apos;s also familiar with dimitri , many of you know dimitri -- went to cambodia and built from us built , just as you were connected to internet .
think about that -- because there &apos;s other people like bill gates , who said , &quot; man , you have a real computer . &quot;
latin , it &apos;s pretty rare . let &apos;s look at some languages .
and guess what ? we won it .
we have the case of integrating no extra feedback system to keep prices down down .
for a more violent , my apartment is kind of alien like space .
and we can take care of the issues of the world .
and to speak from a cliff , i was told to be a little bit of time , though i don &apos;t know what party is going to support or attack .
wealth is going to fall away from people who are not supposed to be a professional .
in terms of taxes , there &apos;s bigger nutritional insects .
no one of these most important theories was a full success .
we &apos;re afraid that the world is watching .
and as a lot of this work , we found something , or i found something that really fascinated me , maybe you can remember it .
in fact , it &apos;s happening here -- from light to darkness in six seconds .
i see your faces very precisely .
this is not a term of joy .
this lady here has even a particularly special face , and both sides are beautiful .
this thing here , it &apos;s the light of light on it , so if you move , it gets a little bit of an object , even though it &apos;s silent -- just just just just just like brilliantly is doing through the reflection .
i had to move this part , but only about a millimeter .
and that one , which i showed you before was a very complex .
it wins or lose in this moment .
the emotional band between this object and you can make it a little bit more , is a more powerful , which is before you think about it .
i don &apos;t think we need to meet these choices .
it &apos;s also a thought that we &apos;ve forgotten .
i think it takes to return to tradition of the sermon .
we don &apos;t think that &apos;s what we do .
and at the end of the day , they &apos;re all on and saying , &quot; thank you plato , thank you , thank you , &quot; thank you , plato &apos;s , thank you . &quot;
the other thing is that art should not explain that artists shouldn &apos;t tell their motives because if they said they were telling the magic and we might find it .
art would be one of the tools that we can improve our society .
we may not be willing to be the appropriate thing , what religions want to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way that they do .
absolutely . i meet how many of you say , &quot; is there not something that &apos;s bigger than we all , something else ? &quot;
because you agree , because you &apos;ve been a similar view of the way that you have a similar view of so many things , and you &apos;re polite .
so he led me from places like chile -- the most cosmopolitan desert in chile -- after siberia , underground mines , in the japanese alps , in north america , to antarctica and even south pole .
it &apos;s the largest lake in the world . it &apos;s 800 miles long .
and they &apos;re not going to believe it , but that &apos;s what the extraordinary big telescope is called .
this was taken from robert &apos;s scott &apos;s scott and his men , as she came to antarctica , on her first expedition to the south pole .
think , these all wiring people in extreme cold , in southern temperatures .
this is an interesting statement , i &apos;ll end up at the end .
what people first do are the book book called the book , which is where you can look for the book , and that &apos;s fun .
it was quite a lot of people there .
but how do we scan them all ?
we &apos;ve reached the 10 cents per page when we work with big volume .
i &apos;m not sure what borrow right now .
you &apos;re standing on a day of two or three camels .
at 15 dollars an hour , video and 100 to 150 dollars an hour , we can put material online online and have it in the net .
the question is : is that the world we want to live in ?
flowers are coming up .
we all know that the earth has problems .
after the form of spores , they rot .
if you go through the landscape , it &apos;s high up in your shoes and trying to react to the emancipation of the moons .
across all the dirt .
some of these mushrooms are very happy .
this is a remarkable rare family .
i did something else that nobody would have done .
the box of life -- you get a dvd from the ted conference -- you give earth to the earth and water , and you have both the same and you have both the kind of plastic and the other , as the styrofoam mushrooms .
i &apos;ve lived in biosphere 2 .
we wanted to know , is that life adaptive ?
i kind of ate myself in some way .
and the doctor looked at us to make sure whether it was really good at us .
and all of them went to me .
and the time , a part of ethiopia used to be a part of ethiopia , one of these places that are amazing and incredibly reactive , and i don &apos;t know how people do it , there .
this is the beautiful picture , this is the amazon .
this is actually a very crude one .
i had to think about how to make the light-activated and cut , but also how to choose the right person to come into a more productive .
you put the break , you took blood off , you &apos;re going to take blood , you look at the blood , put it on the microscope , put it on the microscope .
but we need a more nuanced tool , pit crews for patients .
and so the medicine is sometimes .
we looked at the wooden towers for skyscrapers , we looked at the most profound , and we found that they have technology and education , and then they have something : they have checklists .
and it &apos;s just hard to get it .
so these are really incredibly , very much bees , and that &apos;s very important .
so that means that beekeepers can replace their dead peoples very well , and that funds could be small .
they take their passengers and their families , and they &apos;re going to be in their families twice the year .
honeybees are in the minority .
take a cave in new york with a new york , now , now , it &apos;s a thousand . this is like san francisco in three years , the population of half the population is the population of half the population .
but now , not all of us have meadows , or hunting , which we can transform , and so you can turn a meadow in a small space area .
and i whistled at the holy night of my wife &apos;s family .
and to defend my title -- like the way that the other athlete and other athletes do that -- i thought i was going to do this again , and i won again .
that &apos;s very promising .
why ?
the blue blue , the largest living creature on our planet . that &apos;s wrong , completely wrong .
while the night they roll their leaves and reduce the movement , and during the day , the leaves will open -- there &apos;s a lot more movement .
he wrote some very interesting letters of his friends , and he wrote the president of his friends , and then the president of the royal society , so the largest scientific authority in britain , in which he spoke from a football party .
and the human being , as well as the human beings , they were inspired by the people , and the animals that he did .
she doesn &apos;t know she &apos;s filmed .
and when it became a common experience , it was funny and something that could laugh about it .
i was inspired by this .
that &apos;s in 2005 .
she got two of my boys who had hidden cameras in the wild .
it &apos;s a wonderful way to spend a more , a , a little bit of a time to watch a stadium in a stadium .
the idea is still in the beginning , but it looks like this .
this is ted .
and this is the orbit i want to break .
now , kids are not yet a big case , they &apos;re a special case .
they &apos;re a kind of a kind of a straw .
and the ones discovered the developments of natural selection are brilliant , incredibly awesome .
this is what we &apos;ve done on this lake .
the ant is not alone .
they just heard this guy .
i really appreciate that .
well , i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what i do .
now maybe we should take the metaphorical .
it &apos;s the devil of speaking . &quot;
so they &apos;re actually a chord , each of them is a single chord .
men , if you don &apos;t understand anything from that talk , is trying to listen to the ted , and you can change your relationships .
the third problem with headphones is the deafness -- the most cosmopolitan of the brain .
so , the big method is a wonderful way .
i &apos;ll leave you with more and more fun that is very good for you .
he said , &quot; i don &apos;t know , but i can show you . &quot;
look what &apos;s in the middle .
you look at this direction , so i &apos;ll close it up here .
we thought this guy .
it &apos;s actually seven billion of the u.s. output that all of their own passion , and they all are as part of a piece of a car and creating this world -- in their own , and in their kitchens .
and yet , you can hear black holes , even if you &apos;re invisible . the reason is that you &apos;re playing on the space-time of the brain .
but our sun is not going to end up as black hole .
now we &apos;ve never seen a shadow of a black hole , but black holes can hear , even though they &apos;re invisible .
we can predict how that will sound .
it &apos;s also supposed to give a mission for space , which hopefully will launch within the next 10 years . it &apos;s called lisa .
it &apos;s closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago we painted even more sophisticated .
trees represent a standstill .
i think that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing for movement .
we &apos;re critical to the west , which is the view of the west , which is our identity to do what we &apos;re going to do , about our women , about our politics , about our politics , about our politics .
but instead , i found a country that was completely ideological and i didn &apos;t get more of the time .
that iran once was a secular society , and we had democracy , and that this democracy was stolen by the american government and from the british government .
i stand here to say that the iranian women found a new voice , and their voice gives me my voice .
on this self , a size , a wholeness , is going to focus .
there is no american compassion .
maybe the swami is right .
they learn swimming through swimming . they &apos;re learning wheel through wheel .
the fossil of this animal is only found in south america -- a beautiful clear field here -- and in this part of africa .
you just see these videos . if you &apos;re bored , you just go further .
but i was thrilled and i was getting on .
the khan academy video is also there .
this is the moving and reflect functions .
red means that they &apos;re going to be a little bit more friendly .
a lot of the efforts to make human beings focused on the classroom is to the teachers .
and the collaboration that they had at los altos was how did it come ?
is it ready for the big toss ?
a few months ago , i got a call from a radio phone in which i work .
but it &apos;s just silent , like a silent movie . &quot;
she said , &quot; who is this charles bonnet ? &quot;
for example , when his favorite paper went to it , he said , &quot; and who are these things that young men ? &quot;
and then , when you were standing , the boy suddenly flew up after the top , 30 feet tall , and disappeared .
these traits of a dialogue is not there .
there &apos;s a region in the anterior part of this fusiform , and the teeth and eyes are represented , and this part of the fusiform is active when people have the most prolific hallucinations .
&quot; kermit means nothing . &quot;
sometimes i find them interesting , and i have a lot of images of this in my lab .
edith widder : i made these pictures with a special camera whose sensitivity of the darkness is being supported by the darkness .
for example , these crab , for example , is bioluminescent material in the water , just like a squid or a squid , creating a cloud of ink .
this is what a plant looks like , actually , but a animal is actually .
there &apos;s something little that &apos;s going on .
it should attack the hunters of the water .
one approach would be to draw a picture .
if we resolve the double helix off in their two strands , they see that these things look like teeth .
it &apos;s triggered and it &apos;s called the water .
one is to a sausages .
again , these are all the things that are all the time , scientific design .
hold your eyes open and your head in motion .
the ability to put concepts intuitive with pictures of objects and processes .
if the most sharp neighborhood is very thin , you can be able to do with care and hard work to the world in the world .
i &apos;m here to commit to you , to help us to support the way people and other creatures are making things more like that .
not by the most violent , but it &apos;s allowed by collective action that comes from literacy .
the other great narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons .
toyota , rather than his suppliers , the same as a network , and they &apos;re treated , and they &apos;re getting it to produce better , even though they &apos;re doing it , even though they train them to produce better for their competitors .
thank you .
thank you .
we &apos;re doing two different things here .
in fact , all about frostbite and difficulties are running and forth -- cold , challenging conditions .
first , we &apos;ve developed a little experiment where we gave people lego pricing and asked them to build something .
and if they said , we gave them a new one , and while they were doing this , we have the other thing that they were building , and they &apos;d be taken apart .
there was a very beautiful relationship between love to lego and the number of people built .
and i think the ceo is basically not understood how important meaning is .
but i should point out that , by the way , that in the shredder condition , people could cheat .
people didn &apos;t want them .
and we had two kinds of people .
think now about children .
and i think that in the industrial revolution adam smith was right than karl marx , but we &apos;re really in knowledge of knowledge . and now we &apos;re in knowledge communities .
this is in modern conflicts , right , because kids let themselves be very easily in the war .
the vietnamese of my mother was so bad that she was doing our history to make our story , all boys and girls , and the new vietnamese names .
afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the population are illiterate .
they didn &apos;t want to do that . it &apos;s just happening . they &apos;ve lost control .
and 70 percent won their lives back .
i think that &apos;s all the energy i &apos;ve got .
this is the european average for the european growth .
up on the right has the same energy consumption per person , in about like canada , about 300 light bulbs per person , but population density is 300 times larger , 1,000 people per square kilometer .
if you want to get a lot of solar cells out , you &apos;d have to take the traditional power system , where you don &apos;t just have the roof , but the landscape is covered with solar cells .
and a third possibility is nuclear .
i tried it . it works . some of the people call it change .
as a boy , since the earliest school age , i &apos;ve been a musician , and god was , thank you , i &apos;ve become it too .
he &apos;s a young one of a community in caracas who ran his name of the back of the night in the prison of the night .
it makes them the new dreams , new goals and progress in the different opportunities , which has music .
this is a very basic technology that helps you to do the right thing to do the right pill at the right time .
as we call simple , more powerful technologies , and that &apos;s the first of five sentences i &apos;m going to talk about in this talk .
this is what happened . she went into the prison .
is the first word &quot; doctor . &quot;
many of these generation will not press the button , even if you have a car company , because you don &apos;t want to fall to the load of the day , even if you paid for the long 30 dollars a month .
the color is different spaces in the house .
i &apos;m going to show you some of the latest and the new inventions of cybercriminals .
if you want your rivalries to go , you &apos;ll go .
how do you get a usb key to a company ?
so let &apos;s imagine that our collusion , which we call a fun of bad hackers , built something more nuanced .
there are some other interesting things that the cybercriminals have uploaded .
well , you probably ask yourself what happened to these people .
in the computer of them , i could identify hotels in which they were recently , with a lot of precision somewhere on the globe .
thank you .
the adults can recognize the juveniles that are the juveniles .
and they &apos;re in something that probably the blood vessels are going through the bones .
we all know that this bone is running and if you appear to appear in acid , should not be left .
the most powerful , the vast wheelchairs are extinct .
so , the point is really cool .
a friend , a colleague , dr. hans cronin , at the aristotelian university , is also working with a lot of time .
people always say , &quot; why do you do that ?
and finally , i started writing my book to write the global scale of this problem , and this shows a prototype of the individual nations in every country in the world .
so imagine that nine cookies i found in the trash , represent the worldwide world &apos;s largest world , okay ? at the beginning we have nine .
this farmer is about 16,000 pounds in growing by kinshasa , which he didn &apos;t put a sheet of a sheet because a little grass , a little bit of grass , are fed up with the pigs .
it &apos;s a living organism , i cut a piece of a piece , put it in a vase , and it would give another two weeks .
and if you use these things , you don &apos;t need to do it .
i &apos;m going to go through a few through .
on the left .
we need to change the stuff .
here &apos;s einstein , of course , the baby , the great fan of the sentence , and i &apos;m not sure that the james &apos;s james harris or richard harris is .
and you can see the icosahedron disappears in the dodecahedron , and then they just merge them together .
what a cat &apos;s cat .
before the horse before the horse .
&quot; 10 milligrams , 20 milligrams . &quot;
so , i said , if i put a circle , i &apos;ll see what the pattern is coming out of , and , boom , the red system .
you have to be exactly ! it &apos;s about measurements , the uk .
there was only two more of the internet in the internet .
i &apos;ll come later to talk about it later .
i mean , all on &quot; the &quot; for &quot; to put in &quot; the &quot; -- &quot; that &apos;s what a call of your favorite card , but for the whole world .
it may definitely be made from people here from the audience .
for example , if we had the chance to have a chance of the last 350 years ago , we would have talked about the current innovation of the military , about the massive industrial technology , and we could have predictions a era of stability in the world or in europe .
now , in this environment where you don &apos;t know whether the potential enemy is going to be prepared to defense or attack whether the weapons are going to attack the attack , the environment is what most of it is , a conflict .
it &apos;s a huge blue surface .
so , if you &apos;ve ever imagined , you &apos;ve ever been able to go back to see how a dinosaur looked like this , so a dinosaur looks like this .
it can &apos;t always shoot and shoot all their strings ; it has to go down to the pants .
he never seems to be in a particular girl .
but what i did was a computer scientist .
you don &apos;t have to worry about the readers in the coastal room , because if you think of a shark &apos;s shark , you &apos;ll have your doubt back to the front door .
you &apos;re going to think of any urgency , so much as possible in the short time possible .
my favorite story was wonderful , more vague , surveys of the wild and pr .
that means i love math and to make the magic to make something that i call &quot; insights . &quot;
audience : 25th .
audience : yay .
audience : seven . seven .
good . then i try the impossible -- or at least improbable .
audience : november . october .
of course , i could make a answer and you wouldn &apos;t know it . i &apos;m prepared .
ok , oh , ok -- you also have a more unfair ?
let me explain what that is .
i &apos;d love to talk about astronomy , but i think the number of people who are interested in the same atmosphere in the world and the other of jupiter is the number of people who are living in a more productive place .
no , if you want to know how society will be in 20 years , you ask a more powerful one .
now , two weeks ago , i &apos;ve been -- you know , i have little , middle and large , big , and big amounts of research for the exhibition .
my mentor . he came up and spent hour to me with me .
i take a test .
right ? that &apos;s simple physics .
if you put it in the book , it &apos;s actually 38 .
and i think ah , that &apos;s the length of the length of the length .
you would think , you know , with all this extra space we would have all of the things that we have .
it &apos;s time i &apos;m going to get away from it .
would that be a little more freedom ?
north of churchill , the , in october , there &apos;s no ice in october bay , november , in october bay .
it took a lot of years of personal health care , before i really started seeing that i really didn &apos;t understand it completely .
frank wilson has a book called &quot; the hand . &quot;
so what does the brain do now for the brain ?
it took a long time -- i had to homer , and i had to homer and i had a computer engineer and the cable and the cable , but as a computer designer , he &apos;s got a joint of a plastic .
their own personal play is unique and often nothing that we think about particularly .
he &apos;s characterized by a sense of a sense of the most powerful , complete blood and success .
how do you prevent the media their work or interpreted the science , what their work now is , about how the most powerful , about like the most , like , &quot; oh , the mri model is going to show the intelligence .
the difference between our nachos and the most cosmopolitan nachos is that our actually is a very valid .
br : and then , after a short kind of a little bit of liquid nitrogen to get this perfect carbon model , we really have something that looks , it tastes , and it &apos;s acting like the original .
and the essence of the ipcc was in paris , his report about the creation of people .
alisa miller gives us news about the news .
it enables it to look at the negative forms that you &apos;re creating , looking at your everyday life system .
for this project , we developed a kind of intelligent organizational pipe .
no matter where i am -- it &apos;s about a process that tries to locate my eyes .
inside is a 400 pounds of serious fusion , which i checked out of a friend .
there were thousands of people , we believe , who were infected with hiv .
: the bottom of a remote region is going to be two hunters of the land , two hunters .
but they &apos;re also going to ask you a different question .
but if we came to this rural fishing market , we found that no one had television there , so they didn &apos;t know his face .
and to say , these viruses are probably going to be extinct in the past with this rural societies in the u.k.
you tell what you &apos;re doing with a very 140 sign or less and less people who are interested in this update .
we constructed an application model what means that programmers can write software with twitter .
&quot; ... give people more information and follow them your intuitions in @ # # ted . &quot;
there was everything i had read books , where people were foreigners , i convinced that books were in , of nature , they had to have , and they had to act from things that i couldn &apos;t identify .
everything i &apos;ve heard about you was how poor you were , so that it was impossible to see it as any other than any other than any arm .
and slowly , i realized that my american roommate has heard different versions of the only story , and saw exactly how this professor , which i said , that my novel is not authentic african .
you start the story of the population of northern america with the arrows and not with the brits , and you &apos;re telling the brits a very different story .
i always felt that it was impossible to be able to do it right with a place or a person if you don &apos;t deal with all stories of this place or this person .
i &apos;ll give every summer to lagos in lagos , and i find it amazing how many people want to say , how many people want to write , to tell stories .
in a recently recently , experiment was done in a group of adults who were doing brains in an fmri scanner -- while people listened to experts .
why did my doctor , when i was operating , &quot; ms. hertz , fit you on , &quot; you don &apos;t get a dent , &quot; and instead , it could have been just saying that i have to take care of no high fever .
my father is sick of alzheimer &apos;s .
and reading is so good as impossible .
even though it &apos;s hard .
so we have to orient to the physical and economic limitations .
and then we also have our promise of our promise .
if you have difficulty , understanding what that means for the average consumers in the united states in the u.k.
if you want a fish , you get a woman and you need a woman , you get a fish . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a longer trip , you can still change the battery and keep on the island .
this is the u.s. bank of the united states .
in india , you don &apos;t understand where the problem is , because most indians , in the oil , are only two or three gallons .
all we need is 10 percent of the energy that we have .
we don &apos;t put it immediately to do it , maybe we &apos;ll take the kids free and keep the slaves .
the argument of the so-called id theory is the same old argument that had been kept over and over again , and over and over again , since darwin &apos;s times .
the natural selection selection is so elegant because it &apos;s the problem to explain the complexity , in shape of nothing else than simplicity .
now the next one : &quot; the president of the royal society let have a strong internal belief , &quot; -- -- that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . &quot;
she feels in a mountain of a minority , but how do american atheists actually do it together ?
i have no idea of other fields like history or philosophy , but i would be amazed if they were different .
darwin was the idea that atheism was right and good for the encryption that the people who are , probably , is , &quot; not being done for it . &quot;
if people like -- if atheists hawking and albert einstein and albert einstein , the word &quot; god &quot; use the word &quot; god , &quot; of course , they &apos;re using it as a practical metaphor for this deep , mystical part of physics .
and the launch cost about 500 dollars , about the value of 10,000 today .

a study of the world &apos;s research for africa has shown that there is a clear thing in 28 african countries .
the state should not be involved in production of production and services because he &apos;s inefficient and insecure on this area .
but what it was like immediately was the kind of the distinction that had been dominated our economic development -- that if the oil prices were high , our economy grew very fast .
the same thing we do in the world .
and otherwise i wish you &apos;d see that here .
he called it , &quot; massive decent , &quot; which means that they could kill 100 million people in the next 50 years .
until recently , we didn &apos;t need to know how a vaccine was just done .
the main challenge for these two viruses is that they constantly change .
these drugs are not cure , but they &apos;re putting a huge triumph of science because they &apos;re the automated death sentence from a very high part of the one to you who have access to them .
but you know , research has been helped us to get a lot of progress to the other diseases for other diseases .
this was a slow , a process of chicken , which was dependent on chicken eggs , millions of living chicken chicken .
and despite the radical increases , and the giant , huge production of the e. , for example , the way that i &apos;ve just talked about -- look at the temperature of the space -- that &apos;s the life of life .
so the challenge is close to the whole force .
the question is , why ?
do you think african union will organize such a conference ?
there are some things you have to know .
the speaker who was on the stage here , i was standing in the front of the dutch muhammad , promised that we had a leader of the leaders in africa .
by stealing it from her people , people .
traditionally the africans hate the governments -- they hate the tyranny .
they decide what they do .
he doesn &apos;t get aid from government , and he &apos;s building a second , bigger boat .
something that would connect us all together .
scott &apos;s results were full of it .
and the challenge for algorithmic filters , these personalized filters , is that they are over the balance because they &apos;re going to go after all , which is first to click .
it &apos;s supposed to be to be able to look at new ideas and to new people and strangers .
and the man said , &quot; well , pretty nice geese , what ? &quot;
i know that you &apos;re waiting for more bad news points -- i just do fun -- but now it &apos;s just coming a short repetition , and then i &apos;ll show you a little bit of the material .
until the most successful in may , it will give you an update on version 2.0 , which you can go directly to buy from the air of the car .
again , all of the republicans here : it shouldn &apos;t go to the ground .
what really struck me in the gulf of the gulf is that they &apos;re a little bit more powerful .
and there &apos;s no one trying to do that , except a few people who are trying to use the beach .
we heard that bacteria eat oil ?
this is the entire floating floating floating through the ocean .
when the japanese pearl harbor harbor , they were recording at least back .
what the donor of birds is working on , i don &apos;t want to have a joke about people who clean birds .
okay , people who call themselves a conservative , if they really wanted to be conservative and really , they should be able to send these companies to the internet floor .
it &apos;s about right and wrong .
and i &apos;ve developed a system to produce medical isotopes .
okay , i &apos;m more than my genes -- all together .
i didn &apos;t ask you to be a little bit of time because it &apos;s true , but to remind you .
they contain a molecule that we know as a computational brain .
and this is just a very , very small thing . it &apos;s much smaller than a human being .
now , neurons like the trees , as well as trees , can grow up , and lose old branches .
and we can actually talk about the most sophisticated .
if you celebrate this number , you can easily get a little bit more difficult for the brain to be in your brain .
maybe this technology will be able to meet ourselves through shooting and put ourselves together in our own brain .
he &apos;s mostly working on music music and ads with his company , the most competitive processor .
so we &apos;ve been prepared to give you a quick experiment to show you this .
ks : no , not yet .
while he did , he noticed a unexpected thing .
ks : so , it &apos;s a matrix of the computer .
ridiculous , right ?
and a few months ago , a friend of mine sent me to this guy , eduardo sousa .
a huge scandal for a few weeks .
but he still did this .
so his farm is incredible .
and then he found this wild plant , which is the most violent plant .
and then they fly in the circle .
i finally came to try to try and get them before i went .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
what the hell is that ?
at least , i think , anyway .
farmers who rely on nature to find solutions to find answers , rather than nature &apos;s solutions .
and from the old to new fire to change , it &apos;s about to change two big stories about oil and electricity that both of the two fifth of the fossil fuel in the air are given .
our fuel for mobility is three fifth to cars .
you can let it calm up , it &apos;s tougher than titan .
trucks and planes can use realistic hydrogen or more advanced biofuels .
even better light and more , and so down the maximum levels of water , and so down to a third .
in about 20 , a little bit more quickly , private growth is cheap solar cells without financial losses on their roofs and lower their own way .
and what we also replace is , in about the same cost , in about the same cost : about six trillion dollars in net net -- although we buy more of what we have or new nuclear power , or renewable power , or renewable , that are more centralized .
so , on results , and not incentives , to focus , to focus on , and conflict to the world &apos;s energy solution , of america &apos;s problems .
i realized that what i had eaten , two of his family &apos;s family , were true .
these simple design systems show that donor donors in areas , where the least kids go to school , they have no schools to do this , and this puts new questions . can aid do that that they need most ?
two years ago , at april 8 , 2010 , i called my father .
i &apos;m not trying to design the toothbrush .
we remember and can look at this in every book of my book son , that life was born four billion years ago -- four billion point of reference two ?
so , i &apos;m not quite sure .
there are risks , there are one trap : the vertical .
you have time to think , you have time to talk about art and talk about things like this .
you go back to the future , back , back , back , so .
they come from families , which are usually one person at home , mostly the mother or grandmother , and they come to their education and their structure .
we bring them to the right and to turn to the left , so they can obey them , and know the consequences if they &apos;re going to roll orders .
let &apos;s go online . &quot;
it &apos;s predicting .
they said , &quot; well , it &apos;s enough for the long-term .
you can support us . this is the task of guys . &quot;
but i have to have my hotdog .
you can listen and join .
so , take the example of the world &apos;s energy system .
if you think about the concept of wikipedia , everyone at the heart is working , and at the end of the world , you &apos;ve created the largest encyclopedia of the world .
there are many people who have the same dream .
a website was made .
there was no leader .
extremism has become tolerance .
the modern tools of neuroscience show us that what happens is that what happens is an incredibly complex process .
we can keep off our own language , but not the stranger languages .
we tested that by the american babies who never heard a second language , at the beginning of the critical phase of the subject .
it may look like a kind of a zero-sum star from mars .
science on one side has a very rational approach to their environment , while art usually has an emotional approach to its environment .
now i &apos;ve got a rented over here to show you this .
let me demonstrate this over here .
the dalai lama once said , &quot; love and compassion are more inclusive .
the box box was the netizens that were burned from a small girl whose body was burned down .
it &apos;s part of every human being .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we choose compassion ?
the wound room in the bathroom .
suppose squares , and honestly , who don &apos;t you like ?
we start with a computer and then we put another more online tag .
then there was even some linux executive , a computer company .
i said , &quot; he &apos;s already a long time .
&quot; have i put what &apos;s burnt ! &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t get a memo . what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what do you do here ? &quot;
so i went to the lobby and saw this indian guy .
marco tempest : if you asked him to fight him , he said , &quot; the greatest thing is : magic is the only thing that &apos;s been done .
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to demonstrate you how deeply terrorism is connected with our daily life .
at the time , when i interviewed the red brigades , i also discovered that their life didn &apos;t have their ideology and politics , but by economic constraints .
i think many people thought i was a little bit more comfortable for a little bit .
but especially they got serious in serious terms of organized crime .
this money was in the street of the room , and the money &apos;s money , understands .
nobody wants the most powerful to control his host and their own blood systems with clients .
some of you may think , &quot; wait a minute . she doesn &apos;t necessarily see how a car &apos;s worth .
clearly , i wanted to leave my favorite card , but what i kind of didn &apos;t have been seeing was that it &apos;s very uncomfortable , it &apos;s a very uncomfortable idea to leave its body .
and i really learned that the bigger the challenge , the bigger the feeling of a special performance when you get to the end .
well , i thought , the atlantic was big , but the pacific is really big .
but that wasn &apos;t without any of the time .
it &apos;s this little green disk on the horizon , which is very nervous , which is a very nervous level .
we can start to make better , more sustainable , more sustainable decisions .
vilayanur savage : why i &apos;m walking across the pacific
this is the world trade system on the front page .
why ? why ? why do you want to do that ?
he doesn &apos;t see any surplus cost . he doesn &apos;t use any extra time .
they were able to make it .
and it &apos;s about comfort , it &apos;s about the comfort of you , that you have no good feeling in places that you have never felt good .
and that &apos;s hard if you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i wondered , how could it be so easy to give up my dreams ?
it &apos;s not so hard to do someone , and one day before school , i said , &quot; sure , you can submit my homework , &quot; and i gave him the wrong answers that i &apos;d written at night .
we both have been fooled by the back mall in class so that we wouldn &apos;t be clueless .
you may have brought your credit card and you brought your teeth , but never told you , because how can you say , if you want to put yourself around you , if you want to put all around you ?
this is french science .
well , all right .
if you look at these trucks here , it &apos;s the largest truck of its way .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the largest and the fastest growing growing of co2 in canada , and it &apos;s also why canada is the number three in terms of the number three in terms of a head .
and as a father , i can &apos;t imagine what that was doing , which is a soul .
by doing that , we &apos;re going to take a big part of our biggest oil technology and replace them with the most greenhouse oil of the future .
the most powerful of their work is the introduction of the most you can buy in every store and the millions of indian women every day on their forehead . it &apos;s about a ritual that &apos;s deeply related to the institution of marriage .
and the shaw shaw was born in the pavement , in the pavement , trained and trained in london .
i hope you can convince that complex and complicated , and it &apos;s not always the same .
the main thing is the one that we want to affect -- the public support for the government .
so i proposed in my first tedtalk that we should spend a planet 21 billion hours a week with video games .
just 30 minutes a day , a day of improvement , and the amount of increase of joy and increase of happiness .
why a game ?
how could a game so much a game in such a profound game could have been so serious , sometimes in the same way that they were eating situations ?
there are four types of strength , or resilience to solve post-traumatic growth , and there are scientifically spacecraft that you can do every day to create these resilience , you don &apos;t need an trauma .
it &apos;s driven by more practice .
here &apos;s another secret for you : if you shake somebody &apos;s hand for six seconds , the most powerful one in your blood is very much increase , the &quot; hippo &quot; .
and in this project , we actually have hundreds of people around the world , and they &apos;re doing this with us , actually , and actually thousands of people are involved in this project , many of his different aspects .
and then a few people came from chicago and said , &quot; the end of 2007 is the slogan of chicago , the global warming festival , and we want to have a huge gallery , and we want them to fill them with their reef . &quot;
wool and the baby care is not two concepts that fit good .
in tourism , &quot; how can i define parallel lines ? &quot;
infinitely . they did it . it &apos;s very .
so , we have a clue , from the local state , the evidence that the most famous of the mathematics is wrong .
and their individual ideas , and their employment with this mathematical method .
this particular kind of creepy property -- the confidence -- is my opinion of the holy grail of neuroscience , the neuroscience , and eventually we &apos;ll hope to understand what &apos;s going on .
this person is otherwise a rough mind , and if he sees his mother , his delusion , he says , it &apos;s not his delusion , he says it &apos;s not his mother .
so if this area is damaged , they lose the ability to see faces .
tables and chairs and chairs -- nothing happens as just as the normal people , and if i show him a picture of his mother , the most low activity is low .
he knows that his arm isn &apos;t there . nonetheless , it &apos;s a convincing , a trivial experience .
you might be able to solve the most powerful , the spasm in the phantom .
and my pain is gone . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , the last three days i didn &apos;t have phantom and therefore , and therefore no longer an imminent , no adequate , no substitute in the nazi , all my pain .
and the blue is blue , kendall is green , another sound could be yellow .
this is the key .
which is kiki , which is buba ?
your favorite thing is to be able to do what most of us don &apos;t deal with .
that &apos;s kanzi .
none of the things you &apos;ll see in this video are the most powerful .
well done .
he &apos;s learned that when he uses both hands , with his conscience of his favorite , very much larger and more powerful , and they can make a lot of the same thing .
a frame means a hut in the forest .
does he look where the sound comes from ?
because we believe it &apos;s not the biology , but the culture .
and some stars die in spectacular explosions that leave these remains .
on the right , gravity is the gravity . einstein explains this .
and it &apos;s going to come out of the way that it comes from the change .
it was still too early , but he was a moral channel , an inspiration for scientists who were worried about control of the guns .
suppose alien creatures have seen our own food point from far outside the cosmos , and not only 40 years , but the total four billion years of the world &apos;s population .
martin rees : is this our last century ?
and it &apos;s even worse : &quot; then i would make a picture of it and make a dozen year-old .
now , these are students , so they gave a lot of money for things like contradictions and makeup .
and then we asked them again how happy they are .
but enormous incentives .
these are the most powerful in belgium .
the teams that we gave money to spend it to spend each other , were to be in other teams and load at the end of the market .
if we hear today from the most successful , from the high school , we often believe that this is one of these most powerful conflicts of the middle east , the roots of the middle east , the roots of itself .
ironically , this was a time when the most of iran was peace with washington , and not the destruction of israel .
this is an analogy that is predicting that , in terms of diplomacy , diplomacy is driven by war , is inevitable .
you can look for certain types of cells or you can look at the different regions and compare them .
the map of port investors at the end was not so good as they could have been , not as good as the map of california .
the trick is .
and the explanation she said , &quot; he was not an environmentalist . &quot;
this system wants to keep the status quo , also the status quo of a government .
so it &apos;s not that my topic is the most important thing . it &apos;s not .
we can &apos;t do anything . &quot;
lawrence lessig : we , the citizens , have to cross the republic
for example , some people in this room will be , &quot; sputnik , &quot; to a scholarship to school .
that &apos;s at all on my pen . &quot;
everybody &apos;s just a little bit of a little bit wrong .
i don &apos;t want to say that the law of entropy is not true , it &apos;s true .
here in the model , you see the attack of the internet .
if you see in north america , they &apos;re all active as many things in the united states , and they ignore each other .
everybody &apos;s most sensitive depends on this critical region , the most important , the more responsible , the more independent cells , which each prehistoric , an electronic rhythm -- a high tension , low -- to send a signal to the pump .
they were a while in each other , and then they were apart .
so i want to show you a few interviews with people who are opening up on the bridge and describe what happened .
now , you don &apos;t usually hold yourself for a metronome , but we &apos;re all running -- we &apos;re going to go back and forth .
im : so , this is just a couple of tons , so it &apos;s going to go quite fast .
it &apos;s the most powerful scientist in his area .
i didn &apos;t say what the list was , but she was in a little bit of order , and i told you , you should search your name , your favorite , or the girl &apos;s girl &apos;s girl .
and also , maybe this fowler , or maybe a computer company , that doesn &apos;t value the moment that you &apos;re economically , a resilience against disease or pests or a different property that is useful for climate change , and the other ones don &apos;t have .
we &apos;re going to see kids in television .
the idea with svalbard was that it &apos;s cold , so you have natural temperatures below freezing .
and if anything happens , you can come and pick it up .
thank you .
look at your body perception ! this is not right .
maybe some lady , a lady ? thank you very much .
you just tried two concepts -- two in the united states , and one at the russians .
madness ! i have to talk about diffusion of innovation -- the things that are going to be , there &apos;s a lot of activity , and then they &apos;re replaced by something else and they die .
i can &apos;t tell you when it &apos;s going to go , because i don &apos;t want the competition to know my schedule .
i mean something really interesting that will happen here .
ok , let &apos;s talk a little bit about the commercial development of space space .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a few years , he &apos;s ready to give up , but one day he has an epiphany .
institutions are going to be naked , and if you &apos;re naked , well , it &apos;s the consequences .
the fourth meaning of openness and fourth principle is a lot of time .
the toothpaste is from the most violent .
you know that bees and fish live in love .
all around us , a medical revolution , instead of a revolution , is going to help us defeat some of the worst diseases of our society , with it .
this is a tumor , dark , gray mass , a non-zero-sum hormone mass , in a brain .
and you can see that the ring disappears from the supply of treatment .
but the real question is : how good does this work work in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add a solar system . it prevents angiogenesis in very effective ways .
but more interesting is the study that the men who have developed the most powerful , so the ones that have more tomato sauce have been the effect that they have fed out less blood vessels to feed their cancer .
albert von the time said that &quot; discoveries are &quot; to see what all of you have seen , and think about what nobody has thought of . &quot;
i &apos;m a demonstration of discover magazine .
it has to be fun , unlike ordinary problems , which are not really good in the very good term that they &apos;re really saying .
this is the background of the other .
you can &apos;t make that physically , but on a computer , it &apos;s going to go over to the computer .
i wanted to make a sequel .
what &apos;s going to be like that ?
so there &apos;s games like &quot; brain republican &quot; for the nintendo , a computer company .
looks like a black character . where is that ?
i really believe that a girl is so powerful that we all had to train , not to be so .
i remember my father , who was very , very violent , i proposed .
we &apos;re so used to to steal girls of the difference , to be the most of their own life that we actually made them to objects and they have turned into them .
and she looked in the eyes of her baby and said , &quot; well , i love my baby . how could i not love my baby ?
when we were there , she did a ritual where she was girl who would have the sergeant , with her families .
and i &apos;m going to be on your side for your life . &quot;
i love that i don &apos;t take things easy .
why should they get me out of it , i want to get rid of it ?
so , in the actual process , all six teenagers said , and the most violent , the most educated they had done by the photo photo .
but the incident was in the middle of january , in the northern hemisphere , to seven o &apos;clock at night .
this is 10 feet away .
and what does this example -- what &apos;s important to us is to keep your memory ?
he was a very religious man .
i got a team of a year and traveling a year by africa where i asked people why they built fractals , which is a great job when you can get it .
and this is going to be on the smallest level to the smallest level .
it &apos;s not really mathematical knowledge .
he said , &quot; if i lived in the jungle , i &apos;d just use a long time , because it &apos;s very fast , and it &apos;s very cheap .
and odd , weird , weird .
we have a more inclusive one .
the bad news is .
instead of turning on friends or relatives , they looked at the workplace .
today , agile development is applied to a hundred countries , and it &apos;s enough to get up in the world .
the fear of huntington is losing . there are beds .
we put some rules on them and we &apos;re stuck with them .
the conversation will run better . &quot;
now , when i first got to go to this tonight to come here , one of my daughters started to come up with me .
and we developed 10 statements .
i was a teenager when i first read &quot; anna chaplin &quot; and the famous first sentence : &quot; all happy families are identical to each other .
i want to show you how something that can be so beautiful .
if i was in the water here , you see a silver piano , and this is the most powerful thing that keeps water from the water of the water of the water . it stays dry .
and plato with all the young boys in his cave , sweeney : woo ...
i &apos;ll show you .
but tesla succeeded wasn &apos;t about the duration .
one thing i want to do is that not all the neurosurgeon that are going to be wearing .
we can turn them down or turn it down , or turn it down .
he &apos;s one of five children .
i showed you that we can apply it into the circuits of the spirit of depression .
we &apos;re in understanding what these circuits are , and what the brain is for the clinical signs and symptoms are responsible for the clinical signs of the disease .
evolution is actually more like a fellow worker than a fellow worker .
that &apos;s enough !
what we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human being , or a banana cockroach or a crab or a captcha , the relative to the relative of this feather , the same for all that we &apos;ve seen .
okay . the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , right ? it &apos;s incredible , students tried it and they couldn &apos;t say it .
he &apos;s doing it with a metal glue .
what we do is we take the hair as a model model , and put them together with another colleagues from berkeley .
and that , by the bare great leaders , they showed the kids , two-thirds of the men who have kids , but only a third of the divorce women have a third of the divorce .
on monday , i left san francisco , my favorite , and i flew to this conference .
and we go out at the end , look at us and say , &quot; how did it go ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous study of harvard business school about a woman named heidi hoo .
and i &apos;ve got my hand back and i fell on the other women , and then you &apos;ve had more questions , just by men . &quot;
a woman invited me to this and i looked at them -- she saw something young .
thank you .
they don &apos;t do it as common as they should , but they do .
so not fear , so the defining factor .
but it hits the middle of the black .
i want to talk about this now , thinking about how we spread in this country in this country , how we get to information .
so they &apos;re in clean , clearly , clearly , and that works .
we tell them that everything is fine ; it &apos;s good .
this patient is about 50 , we can say , quite quite precisely , how big its risk is to get cancer .
they don &apos;t need the way the listeners of the audience in this room .
and this bee certainly had said , &quot; i &apos;m getting this kind of thing , these bloom , i &apos;m going to get the nectar and then go out . &quot;
and if you talk about nature , that &apos;s my favorite thing , how is the idea of the idea of the brain ?
well , we &apos;re all the equally sophisticated .
the only technology here is the cheap carbon dioxide : pretty new , a car battery , in a car battery , even i could close a freak from 10 ar in 15 minutes .
if a computer designer , the grass is going to be on this altitude , and it &apos;s going to be something interesting .
and now i say that i want to build a layer of games on top of the world , but that &apos;s not true , because it &apos;s already in development ; it &apos;s happening .
if not , it &apos;s a bad thing . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
come on a certain time , you get your drinks half the price .
and then you can really get good to different kinds of things .
and it &apos;s powerful .
so , the whole idea is a collaborative dynamic that tries to find the best news that &apos;s most exciting stories .
we &apos;ve been talking to you last time a few years ago .
you can also see , if i turn this around -- hopefully i don &apos;t get the world too much .
you can see here it started .
this is one of our engineers .
so , neutrinos that were supposed to teach students to teach the law of the inevitable , just as a hobby .
raise your hands .
it makes it a place where it makes fun to work .
and so this is something we work on , and we even have people who are excited about it and crazy enough that they &apos;re working on it , that &apos;s really their goal .
thank you .
what brunel said , he wanted to reach for his passengers , was the experience of showing the landscape .
what does life make a difference , more friendly ?
so , in part , they &apos;re doing this by building a great new device , using the basement of a family .
today , the industrial systems of time have been highly restrained and they have become part of the present problem .
and as brunel can do , we can have a lot of the systems that we have on systems , a bigger effect .
from my persistence , the waiter gave me the waiter with his boss .
mark mandelbrot and i have tried to answer a series of studies , right now , to answer this question .
yet it &apos;s exactly what the american paradigm demands .
but for the european union , the sudden availability of all these things were the way that a computer spill .
the americans themselves discover that unlimited choices seem to be more attractive in the theory than in practice .
and the parents would say more things like , &quot; noah was just for the short time here , but he taught us so much .
robert frost once said this , &quot; it &apos;s poetry that &apos;s lost by translation . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant piece of pink . &quot;
the three problems have one in common : they &apos;re more nuanced problems that are controlled by forces .
so , thank you very much .
it should replace competition through collaboration .
and then we build a more powerful , which we can test the maximum performance of machines , and so we can get very , very quickly .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that the most important thing is that the most successful thing is , it &apos;s not a matter of a design , but as a design movement .
the bomb enters the stage .
and then the 92 nuclear nuclear power would provide the energy that would send the rest of los angeles .
then you take it and stick it on the screen with your television , and you &apos;re just going to take it out to the outside , right ?
if you replace the word blogosphere or the internet today , it &apos;s very , very , very true that his perception is now very introverted . let &apos;s hear in it .
i think it was a exchange that was led to computer .
ph : i hope you understand how to make it a lot of time .
ultimately , the race won the momentum to the momentum , when the phone phone is called the phone phone .
mm : because it has given the audience a role to do something .
they produce things for 1,500 and 800 dollars per minute .
and where television has been doing what &apos;s built , what &apos;s built is a very exciting new way of communication , and we have the collaboration of two industries and a new way of thinking about it .
this is a spanish architect and designers .
color can amplify simple blocks , simple materials : if i go through new york , i &apos;m going to be .
i gave it more money -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco , and we all talk to us and build some installations .
the use of the city for public space has been significant , almost a international model .
even the bits of the airplane had french names .
he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s more girls there . &quot;
and that was , after all , as i was , after some of the things that i was , and the design of the chair , i ended up doing the same thing .
he said , she &apos;s got one of the new , better chairs .
or they pull up to the position of the position .
i knew then , but i knew about the office , and when i went around the offices , where there was no one on the idea of the idea that anyone would come to the idea , to turn , to turn , to turn on , to make it in position .
and fever has spread into the wild .
two days ago , i can &apos;t remember that , i can &apos;t remember that in a training room , i &apos;ve read that the first one is the first to say , about 52 young cases , with about 400 likely cases .
we need something that was really a really profound thing , so he doesn &apos;t have the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : males hits females , lots of young boys .
so , the biggest problem is not our biggest problem .
&quot; why now ? &quot; &quot; why here ? &quot;
and most of the time i don &apos;t take it , although i &apos;m a training card .
look at the same data .
now our mobile phones can now engineer a story of our online technology .
bill mcwhorter : your health depends on where you live .
this is my grandfather .
and the simple reason that nobody else talks about it .
so , like at the beginning , plants are moving from water from the ground .
here &apos;s the title of a remarkable article from a design of nature , which is the discussion of the phosphorus crisis .
eighty percent of it &apos;s been heard like this .
and instead of taking a dose of 100 percent , we take one of 25 percent .
we have a functioning technology , and we have a , which is going to be a few of the most powerful outcomes that we &apos;re doing on the earth &apos;s surface .
and he was a writing called the &quot; all of the time , &quot; and it was all the time that he looked at the whole and mutations to find rules and laws , rather than looking at the norms .
and in this example , you see that the individual stages are over , but they &apos;re going to be , without being a little bit of time .
as an architect , i just think about relationships between the individual and all of the things , but in terms of behavioral design , it &apos;s always going to be a matter of business .
we were giving us the level of the building , where we could build the five separate towers , but they should all be on the 60 floor to a single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single thing .
come back again , a few years later , in 2003 , and we &apos;ll see that these landscape are honest in the face of the ice , as a rainforest .
the difference is mostly in the desert in the desert , or maybe maybe the most cosmopolitan in the desert , which you want to do .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that were illegal , and now the air are .
we have doubled the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world , just by fertilizers , which cause huge problems in water water ; in rivers , lakes and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the most important thing to be the most important for the long-term health system .
but we can do that and there &apos;s opportunities to get it .
irrigation is the biggest largest animal in the world .
need to work together .
so -- what is the system that is actually that system d.
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
the entire system of chaos doesn &apos;t pay taxes .
we interact with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biological modification shifts to amplify these kinds of cells -- muscles .
this is what this looks like .
here we go , or cut the nerve , from small parts of the brain , and then other parts of the world , and then we gave the other to our team -- signal -- two other people who are holding our hand -- signal .
ak : it works well .
but i can &apos;t put electrode up , and i can say , &quot; there . &quot;
and that &apos;s our goal -- a little clinically more dramatic to carry .
this is jesse and he picks a joint of a computer .
so thank you very much .
sub-saharan africa is largely , because there are 22 million people living with hiv , that are estimated 70 percent of the 30 million people who are infected in the world .
governments in front of the ground have to create effective for ethical aspects in clinical trials , which are approved in the different developing countries , and they &apos;re going to be placed in the developing world , which is independent of the government and the most vulnerable of the study .
the fundamental problems we faced are a high consumption of consumption and too many people .
so they all fulfill the criteria that usually people would like .
so you see this electricity , which goes north -- the most powerful in this case -- the back to the galapagos , and this is the most powerful , the most powerful , the water that goes up to the galapagos .
we also know that not only are the illegal threats , but the other predators and other people &apos;s disease .
now i want to show you that penguins are moved in the wild .
turbo was walking up with his nationality to pat the door , and we let him go in here .
and then there &apos;s another one who comes out pretty comfortable .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we don &apos;t solved : our fundamental political geography .
the two parts are a pretty long frontier .
again , the case of mongolia , china didn &apos;t have russia . it &apos;s going to be .
for the country of the country , china reduces its own , so that the most powerful and cambodia can be sold as cheap and from the federal revolution to china .
what i want to introduce you to here is , i call a day , day .
these two arrows form a bow , a bow of a football and other infrastructure that connects the west bank with gaza stripes .
a lot of them .
so what &apos;s next ? how does the future of european union look ?
53 countries and at far most of the suspects on the line are the top of the line .
this dream is still his time time .
it &apos;s bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
okay .
and that hormone variability is promoting growth .
so how can a hormone eventually beat aging down the speed of aging ?
we think that insulin and igf-1 are hormones that are particularly active in the circumstances of the circumstances -- in good times -- if food is enough , and not a lot of stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details about how it works , but we know that foxo is genes on life expectancy of people .
and basically , you could adapt the genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process i &apos;ve talked about is what &apos;s going on in the worm , a different normal internet model , like a bird , so that the bird can live much longer .
you will never see such an ad , because nike wants to buy your shoes .
they all show heroes that were the most powerful .
it &apos;s like trying to walk against a computer .
this is a view that many of the things that make the most powerful , like prozac , is basically changing the chemistry of the brain as if in fact the brain of the container would be a chemical soup .
and my colleague , seymour mcchrystal believes this .
and by the time we found that a mutant , a lot longer , needed a lot of time to go back to the top of the world , and when we put the genes together , the gene was able to detect a role , we could discover a more , a more powerful one .
and this question has been asked for a long time , but we can actually test it in a long way .
so , like that , mosquitoes are going to find us in the dark by telling us .
just by that you see it , that &apos;s the cheese .
people even told me that they &apos;re going to be bitten by mosquitos now .
in the wild of the day .
and every time i felt the tv-industrial , the eyes were convicted of me .
and as a result of the , fat is one of the best sources of adults for adults .
while we &apos;re talking about the 1918 clinical trials , we &apos;re going to use the research of stem cells for the use of stem cells .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angels in the world , not only in our country : venezuela . in our entire world .
so what happens when what happens ?
but here you see what &apos;s really going on .
i can &apos;t tell you about it , because i stopped the headline .
vilayanur gopnik : what you don &apos;t know about marriage
but how ?
it &apos;s even better . it seems that we can make these receivers , with help that is encoded in the dna .
the animal jumps , it &apos;s spreading its wings , it &apos;s floating , but it can &apos;t really take it off , because the fly is caught between two glass .
for a smart creature like our fly , this rule is not in stone , but it &apos;s changing as the animal learns through experience .
so many of these experiments were we able to predict the identity of the critic to 12 cells .
there &apos;s a couple of ideas in the computer , and the artificial intelligence , how you could do that , but we still haven &apos;t solved one example , as intelligent behavior of the physical interaction of the physical interaction .
here &apos;s avelile , or actually a computer company , in avelile .
ed : all right . all of a sudden , tb : okay . a little bit more to the middle .
i know from their own experience , i know hospitals can be a very dangerous place .
here &apos;s a picture of my favorite panel from legacy .
i &apos;m telling you , this kind of healthcare system , which is all of the goals that all of it is to be able to change the current , the most powerful we &apos;re going to see in our lifetime in health care .
they don &apos;t stick like a velcro nor a velcro or glue .
here we have the robot .
marc s. reed built the most powerful .
what would happen if you put it on the bottom of the paper and it would come to a laser , or we would shake the sheet ? &quot;
and so , we &apos;ll go . and he does this .
of course , it &apos;s completely different when you see that in a nanotube .
we &apos;re going to look at increasing sea rising .
and i would say , people work in the ocean and think about the goals , we &apos;re the opinion of it , you should be much lower .
this is the ship that i was the last three months in antarctica .
if this ice rises up the sea level , it &apos;s about six feet .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news for the coral is the galapagos .
you have the water temperature .
but then you see the most popular thing in black .
we have very interesting opportunities in the co2 ocean in the atmosphere , and we &apos;ve always done this with a little bit of time , but we &apos;re going to go back 20 million years .
and this is the task that einstein asked : figure out how the gravity works .
einstein had already had room and time , biases and curves in order to describe gravity .
but deep in the structure of space , so the idea could be , it could give more dimensions than we see there .
and as much as the strings of a cello , they can vibrate differently , they can vibrate in different patterns .
not yet .
is this just an interesting mathematical construction that might be able to explain some of the things that are possible to explain some of the things that are possible , or can we actually demonstrate these extra dimensions ?
so we have two plates on the side here .
now , can the predator see that the predator are doing that ?
and what sensory information is true is true for all the information .
and we look about 30 seconds of what a hammer is in a very , very much of a hammer .
why ? because if the bottom in this shadow , in fact , in the shadows , and the same amount of light on your eye would reflect the same amount of light on your eye , it would be more reflected -- just to the laws of physics .
where do you know that ?
and she comes into the hive , you find a blank blood , and your hands are -- and that &apos;s honey .
he finds it . madness , right ?
agree ? yes ?
there &apos;s often no right or wrong here .
in 2010 , in new york , not so much .
we &apos;re also a storyteller of a storyteller .
now some things : understanding of security , the risks , the dangers , the deficit , how they work .
but in a modern and complex world , they need models to understand the many risks we are facing .
think of cancer , bird flu , flu , sars .
there was no new insights , but less fear .
and there &apos;s another cognitive bias : i call it a little bit of time to accept data that we &apos;re going to do to accept our data and reject data that &apos;s going to be the most disturbing and to reject our own business .
i &apos;m familiar with another group , realizing my airplane was safe to fly on it .
this is the people who do .
and he was found in the near , at stanford .
they had good coverage of their teachers , students .
let me ask you some questions about what that is to find out , &quot; well , that &apos;s a good choice . &quot;
i took some people to get to it , and to save them , or save me , when i could be told to be a volunteer , but i found that nobody did anything .
we opened the first section in 2009 .
robert pugh : building a park in heaven
and groups were very often called &quot; terrorists &quot; .
they need a process of a process that can deal with the core of this very complicated society with his problems .
it &apos;s about the first time we &apos;re probably in the history of the arab world a revolution , a computer company .
the paradox is that this was so promising decade ago , and that &apos;s a reason for a reason .
once , in the clinical states , ngos called their slogans , not only on the streets -- they took them into the negotiations , because they were being tracked by the victims of these guns .
thank you very much for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; good &quot; thing .
so this was completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little bit crazy to work on a new computer program .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this strange man in the movie ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the last day , the sun comes out , the somali , they come straight to the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i &apos;m going to give you a little nervous here because i &apos;m going to tell you a few radical things about how we should think differently about cancer to a audience that has a lot more knowledge than i do .
the part of the genome we can read is the list of ingredients .
it turns out a huge amount of information in genetics , by simply taking the genetic similarity .
and i like , &quot; okay . at least this guy is good . &quot;
so we basically measure every single single single single single single time .
if you have malaria , we give them a little bit of time , or some of the things that are done .
where do we really have to get the process , which is just going to be the point , and that &apos;s on the level of the brain &apos;s activity on the level of why the body doesn &apos;t heal itself , how does it translate it ? &apos; &apos;
danny hillis : cancer is understanding by proteomics
they &apos;re all members of tribes .
it doesn &apos;t work , these people just give up .
because at stage three , most of us are .
this is their lobby .
there was no plan . never before tried any of these .
in fact , martin luther king was a sentence in stage three .
so i &apos;m sitting here in this chair , and i &apos;m doing nothing . &quot;
and suddenly they got out the street , and they tried to figure out , &quot; how do we ask the population of sub-saharan africa ? &quot;
we automatically do that little piece of plastic after up .
these are the ones that were designed to be designed to create just so much to create the taxes for the ground , on the ground , which they were , not as a permanent building .
they &apos;re going to be able to do the stability and security that can offer the lap of uncle , you compare them to the legendary construction of a football niece in high school .
but from my perspective , compassion has a problem .
and it &apos;s the form of pleasure of pleasure satisfaction .
i can &apos;t really explain it , and he doesn &apos;t .
stories like this , such as these , are practical aid in a world that &apos;s looking at compassion , to bring compassion to the networked images of suffering that otherwise could undermine us .
gandhi was also a really poor person .
and the first day we had our favorite film , and our motto to us , and our motto , which we had to give up every day for the rest of the summer to make the disbelief .
this is one of two or three of your known known .
here are some examples .
it turns out we can &apos;t be part of a group without filling the other to the other .
so that &apos;s the world where we live today .
and so i &apos;m trying to learn from my grandfather &apos;s own way .
okay , number two : go into the wild .
and imagine that , you &apos;re going to be able to be a core image : i was born in a very small village in mexico , unfortunately , very high circumstances , and my parents had no higher school .
and so we believe that through all the changes that are happening , we &apos;re now going to face incredible opportunities .
it &apos;s a initiative that &apos;s on simple , stroke , and the more powerful solutions .
we &apos;ve come up with 30 different technologists now in 18 different countries , and we were able to connect millions of people to learn what this particular segment needs and demands .
and my father came to me and my father came back to me , and she said , &quot; you know , i remember that every generation has to make it better than the previous .
i know many people who are very smart and yet say , &quot; why don &apos;t i solve my problem ? &quot;
i started with the other family in 1980 .
don &apos;t you think we have the responsibility to take the environment seriously ? &quot;
i still go to the same four years old ford as before .
but that &apos;s not a good life .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s praying .
whether you believe it or not , doesn &apos;t make me difference .
so he said , &quot; what do you think there &apos;s in your hand ? &quot;
what &apos;s in your hand ? &quot; i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball , and this basketball basketball represents your identity , which you &apos;re .
when my kids were still small , i went to her room , sat down on her bed , and looked at my children in sleep .
it &apos;s less than i had a lot of time -- i &apos;m going to do three to 10 million -- but yet it &apos;s a very significant number .
in a village , we have 100 laptops , every one with a different collection of 100 books , so that the village has 10 books .
right , the famous chinese character for the main world .
they answer the question : how does it feel that you &apos;re going to be able to be involved in sadness ?
we really learn this really bad lesson .
think about a moment of how it &apos;s , to feel right .
and unlike all other animals , we are obsessed with trying to figure out .
and i have to tell you that i thought i was writing this incredibly nerdy book about a subject that everybody hate , for a audience that would never be told .
the effect of this is not just the wheat of the wheat , but mountains of grain .
1986 , she came from vietnam to america .
the answer was , &quot; that &apos;s even worse . &quot;
our main team dropped on a third of the average in our industry , and in the five years of the dotcom , our oil team has tripled .
and bhutan , for the ones that don &apos;t know , is the youngest democracy of the world , only two years old .
it &apos;s actually that we &apos;re often picking up in the west , when happiness is something we need to capture , a thing , or maybe several things that we need to get .
and we ask 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s the simplicity .
what we need to learn as leaders is that we can influence the production of production by creating the right conditions , so our employees can be able to live their lives .
bl : okay . one , two , three .
under the deck of the deck , you tell you the inner ear , but the eyes move in the balance with the boat , and say , &quot; i &apos;m silent . &quot;
amy , you come up please ?
the method : what did you do ? the result : what have you seen ?
i just read one .
real scientific education should give people a voice and enable them to express these also , and so amy is supposed to have the last word in this short story .
poor people don &apos;t have this opportunity to choice .
we were thrown down in the &apos; 70s .
and to come up there , we have to realize that the principle of a computer is not just being exploited by the species that we &apos;ve talked about , but our society is going to be able to restore .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure someone has already wondered , &quot; yes , great things up there -- but how do i get up there ?
i was a professor at the university of davis , and i got a lot of attention to it , and that allowed me to fund the launch of the program .
we have eight motors in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart , they fall apart and they end up here .
i mean , people ask if cell phones are safe .
you have a coil .
because , remember , the original idea of dr. dunlap : the most powerful mobile phone of his wife .
and for those who can &apos;t read it , it says , &quot; it seems like a kind of wireless technology . &quot;
green or natural , where not a matter of the disease is going to be a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the existing constraints in our bodies .
first , a computer , a fixed , mixed with the death of death , which is the &quot; the death penalty of death . &quot;
only months later , i learned who he was really .
i &apos;m looking for a cure .
i say , &quot; hold it on , if you can . &quot;
even with this kind of paper , in our hands , we have the hope that we have to reinvent hope .
it &apos;s a feature .
suddenly he &apos;s got to be defeated .
to give you this , we have to put it back on the driver &apos;s driver .
we &apos;re going to put the area , we put it in , we sent people into it , we put the buildings in the place , the building systems , we helped the first to be the first to the search and the rescue .
if i do this , i don &apos;t get the original details , the opposite , i could write history here .
you &apos;re going to see the public opinion .
that &apos;s not very good .
and what &apos;s a democracy of this is a democracy .
here &apos;s the question : which country cut better , china or india ?
because the indian man has a advantage of two years of life to the indian woman .
what political change is , they &apos;ve introduced them to the world .
china , i think , has still some very amazing , more precise , basic , public health , public health , public health , a sense of equality , which is not there .
it was a place where people with all these different stages and with various kinds of information , and they &apos;re going to be a lot of time .
and now they have the problem that they &apos;ve spent the whole money to do with this progressive electronics in these countries and now it &apos;s all useful .
a slightly chaotic environment where many ideas were born , where people have more new , interesting , more interesting , more interesting , people .
about a decade ago , a wonderful , wonderful , wonderful , a wonderful , wonderful comic name , and she read darwin &apos;s notebook from this period .
they &apos;re going to be in their colleagues , but everybody said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think it was to do it .
does that go the other way up ?
in the 1970s , the one percent of the national income was made in the united states in the united states .
many of these political factors can be pronounced roughly in the category of crony capitalism , political transformations , which help one group of good information , but actually nothing good for the rest of us .
as you can see , as globalization and technological revolution , this global rule of money can create the money , it &apos;s much harder to evaluate all the way .
so they invest for unprecedented amounts of time and tools to train their children .
we created the modern health system .
this is his little hand .
one of them is we &apos;re all going to die .
this was a huge disappointment for us , because we believed in a new development .
i even believe that in places like oregon , where you &apos;re taking care of medical care , and you can eat a toxic dose , only half a percent of people ever did it .
so long talk short : they came to canada .
but i heard about cancer as the most of our time , as the most powerful disease of our time , how does the good and the bad thing together ?
some articles even went to say that skeletal tissue is resistant to cancer , and beyond , not only against cancer , and beyond , it &apos;s not just about cancer , but it &apos;s getting metastases in skeletal muscle .
16 percent ! that there were these kinds of tumors in skeletal muscle , but only 16 percent of the actual metastases -- what &apos;s called the fish that skeletal muscle might be able to control that angiogenesis can be able to control that blood vessels that are connecting to these blood vessels .
this is a very far idea of the idea , but i really believe that this is possible .
after that , my translator left me .
she was the girl who was going to be in the breaks for the other to her team .
and i was writing a letter on my best friends in atlanta , georgia , who had 11 year-old son .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot; i asked the translator .
so the two came to lunch , and we were thrown out of the restaurant .
he had children in all korea , and he found families for her .
they have a lot of time covering the dictionary .
so i open the window , look out , and look how fire &apos;s from the side of the hotels , the diameter is burning .
so we ran into the bathroom , and we took down , and they thought they were our faces and the children .
until the adoption is through it . a year ! what does it need ?
this is their favorite group .
this is sydney , which is a few days old .
but there was no evidence .
there are little planets , there &apos;s bigger planets , there &apos;s big planets , okay .
but there &apos;s a lot more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something that depends on the person &apos;s planet ?
and this deeper amount of light , underlying the point , is that science is the way we know it , to define life .
okay , let &apos;s say , this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , all the stars , here .
thank you very much .
look down , as uganda goes down and zimbabwe , russia went to a percent of the country .
they find the highest hiv in the world in african countries , and yet they find in senegal , here , the same rate as in the united states .
look at kenya here .
it could be something else , which is the transmission of the transmission .
we know about 1.1 billion people ever lived .
that was not just an economic story .
and the result is even a greater divergence in a shorter period than it was in germany .
it &apos;s also about institutions .
you have to give me a food . &quot;
he was wrong .
now , i want to end with three questions about the future billion , shortly before ethnicity , if the united states is losing their place as number one one economy .
no , we &apos;re probably going to be able to hold the huge , regardless of the huge animal that we put together , regardless of the signs that we have lost our work and the other parts of our historical narrative .
niall , thank you .
there are many types of silk silk .
spider silk is almost completely made of protein .
the fibers that make a single spider can be quite diverse .
also , the most powerful potential has a lot of potential to the most violent .
what i want to focus on is not the mermaid , so lovely she may be , but on the photos .
you have to have physical structure .
there are more pictures . there are more photographers .
that sounds alien in our ears , but what happens is that 80 percent of the contributors have contributed a lot of the contributors .
the first thing that happens when you &apos;re a problem is that the first goal of the institution is instantly changing by the goal of the end .
the inventor doesn &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states who try to figure out whether the bloggers are journalists or not .
it was built by creating their own favorite use , using many of these tools , and they &apos;re not going to do the intelligence intelligence of the world today , the same work for attacks in the last week .
you have a little bit of the time , which is probably for us the shortest part of the bread , or the fibers , because it &apos;s just full of fibers , because it &apos;s made of fibers .
everything is on his place . first level .
we call it &quot; the &quot; guide . &quot;
but let &apos;s look at the different steps , under the point of the possible connections to a deeper level -- my search is about the answer to the answer , &quot; what is special about bread ? &quot;
this is transformation , two different things .
and if you &apos;re shaped , you go back to prove that you &apos;re alive , and nature is developing .
if you do this bread , you can use any kind of daylight of a beer .
it will become a kind of a kind of a conceptual system while we &apos;re working through this talk .
it takes very , very long , to write these scores , and i &apos;m working on a piece that is 180 pages long , and that &apos;s a big part of my life , and i &apos;m going to get the hair .
it &apos;s presented by brian potts &apos;s , who is an extraordinary artist .
you have a little taste of the piece of the piece .
what we did -- betty , a student , one of my students , and i -- we gave the babies two dishes with food : a bowl with a fiber of broccoli , and a bowl of a mountain with a fiber cap .
i mean , last day , if we look at babies , they appear quite useless .
and our babies and children are much longer dependent on us than the babies each other species .
the main line is to change it , to change the hypothesis .
now , there are two things that really are interesting about it .
boy : that &apos;s why .
our consciousness is going to be extremely bright and vivid , and everything else will be like dark .
&quot; babies and small kids are like the research and the human species , &quot; says the psychologist is ignoring gopnik , their research , as babies play in the game of playing subtle information and making decisions .
if i could just give you a little demonstration for a little demonstration , to show the difference -- because it &apos;s pretty trivial .
then you repeat this process , and again , again , to something that comes out of the way -- in this case , the character is like me , running straight .
what we really wanted was the whole human body .
you can &apos;t do that as well .
here &apos;s a few simple scenes , like he came up with .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we &apos;ve done it anyway .
some 1980 already uses our software to do exactly the same , and we &apos;ll soon get a few of our data points in a few major ways .
we thought he was just going to hold the balance .
here you learn to go to the ted level -- like most of you hopefully know .
but i have to say , i &apos;m never going to forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i &apos;m convinced that art and creativity are essential to develop empathy .
if you &apos;re ever lonely , you &apos;re going to get a new york times , and then you get hundreds of emails . most of what i &apos;m going to get to you today is covered by frustration .
some stories are just classic , and yet it &apos;s so appealing .
it cleans . nobody ever bought it .

and to cut the danger of these new things , we need to cut the ability to have the individuals that are basically doing access to the access to the water .
i think the challenge that we face -- i &apos;m very sure that this is going to happen -- the challenge is : will we develop these online data with the background that will take us from this device ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , for example , you all have incredible properties of these incredible properties .
and to give you a sense of the last little commercial fund -- he was in 400 million dollars , which is right for us , so that &apos;s quite remarkable .

12 years ago , caves started to me , and i shifted my research into this direction .
wonderful and grim things .
there &apos;s ice under the surface .
so they &apos;re a different form of life .

at the beginning of this year , a virtual asteroid was sold for shenzhen .
the really interesting thing about virtuality is you can measure it .
now , i could develop a game called the name of the name , just to get a million pies , or a thousand pies .
if it &apos;s real boxes , we can &apos;t do much , but in a game we say , &quot; ok . &quot;
this is absolutely crucial and virtuality in it .

this is a key one that i received two years ago , and that was one of the greatest projects i &apos;ve ever involved and my company was involved .
but i &apos;m going to just start to talk about the beginning of the process , on three very large titles .
if we &apos;re so good , where we &apos;re going to do what we &apos;re doing , then we don &apos;t have to be able to create an architectural manifestation that &apos;s absolutely intuitive by the most sophisticated and the downs of the light .
the architectural approach was , frankly , frankly .
and this is the real money of trouble .
the second technology we &apos;re using is we use things that you know about the most of an opera that you know .
here you see the most violent configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk about how to collect stories , in terms of the way you can see .
one of these projects is about a year old .
these are the images that are automatically created .
as long as i was awake , i had the camera to go around .
you can see a timeline that shows you the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s a little bit of a time . well , further .
a routine foster car worker .
an artist , a foreign farmer .
what if you were just a year after a year , what would you do the next 35 years of life ?
&quot; money , and a business open , &quot; the indian state of power .
while the anesthesia was told to give you that he wanted to be , and he had a kind of a care of me .

with the hand , it &apos;s almost impossible , except in the blink of the room , and then the communication is limited .
very funny people , if lol means that .
you don &apos;t do that in the course .
if someone had seen a black board in 1973 , the most powerful board would have been a little different since the time of &quot; love story &quot; , but he would have understood what was there .
i &apos;m about the most violent , i wanted to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you can look at my work next week , and also in the most violent fashion factory in the south of the city .
afghanistan doesn &apos;t think of existential threat for global security .
and the same is true for the troops .
instead , there was a 24-hour optimism of the optimism .
diplomats dig in in the wild .

rory , she mentioned libya to finish .
so here you see two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger to show you how it looks .
there are also also a lot of time , which is , but if you &apos;re going to get these online spots , it &apos;s used for a different kind of information .
the most powerful thing . this is a hard problem for reasons i &apos;m not going to be .
there &apos;s another one , very interesting connection , and this is that what you want to do is to lead valuable information on a common , rather bad phone .
so , i think it has the minimal food that we can possibly achieve to make things .
and we decided we shouldn &apos;t think about it as much as we should think about the cost of simplicity , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book that says , &quot; what &apos;s the most powerful deal with kansas ? &quot;
so we have to ask why .
but nonetheless , you don &apos;t mean much with people who don &apos;t have that much like you are .
so we can think about things like the most cosmopolitan .
i &apos;m kidding , but only half if i say that no one will believe you , if you get a missing piece , without a little bit of a sudden , mri and the internet .
then he turns on his students .
within a few years , in the late 19th century , early 20th century , the doctor was faced by trying to put a diagnosis to the death of the day .

my friend simon singh , a baby scientist , who was a ph.d. , named the big bang , etc .
and now they open their eyes .

my experience with the islamic world is very different .
so , there &apos;s the figure noora .
and why does sex lead to babies , and why babies in relationships mean an erotic disaster ?
because it &apos;s the secret of desire .

this is her favorite , and you see , that &apos;s biology , the natural instinct .
and then the desire starts to do this . this is how curiosity takes to be , you know .

ok .
that &apos;s usually played in smaller rooms .

thank you very much .

lg : just like .
licklider &apos;s computer , the computer can make the necessary bits of wood to make insights and decisions .
every interaction is recorded by more sensors : your phone , your card card , your computer , your computer , and you &apos;re going to get the opportunity to understand our existence .
these records were human modification .
by a permanent process , what else is a task for 40 people , was to be a simple task for three people in 40 hours , and that &apos;s all smiling .
we should stop seeing out .
at dinner with my wife and the children , they drive home .

help me make green black to the new black . help me make sustainability sexy .
so i thought that would be a chance to use scratch to make a interactive map for my mother .
but i &apos;m skeptical of what this kind of thing is .
in this case , you take a laser , put it on a pile and the stack of the pile of the brain , which is the behavior of different characters in a game or a story , in this case that &apos;s the big fish .
if you learn to code , you can code to learn .
if children like victor create such projects , they learn important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s just the beginning .

and i think that this idea that great cars have been a soul , very useful , and they all know that . they know a car with a soul at the first sight . they know how much it is .
this is one of my favorite things that really describes our relationship to cars .
right ? and they decided that it would be cheaper , instead of a studio , and six or seven apartments , elizabeth , in malibu .

100 billion is the only number you need to know .
what you have to think about is that we have to do it with a universe with a hundred billion stars , with a hundred billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t explained was why entropy was ever low .
unlike the low entropy of the early universe , even though we don &apos;t know the answer to the answer , we have at least a good theory that can explain that if this theory is true , and that the theory of the dark energy .
and therefore , although the universe is going to continue , and ordinary matter and radiation will be pulled down , a certain amount of radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even in empty space .
but we also give it big fluctuations .
it &apos;s obvious .
it &apos;s an airstrip of the universe that you &apos;re expecting to be wondering and not question .
i had never used a computer .
it was a future i couldn &apos;t accept .
now i want to do something out there , like me , to say , to the africans and the poor , to fight with their dreams .

and some are in every case to be able to use it for the battles .
our strong response to images , the expression of emotions in the art of music , is going to be in front of us and our offspring as long as the human race exists .

so what i &apos;m proposing is that there &apos;s where we should look for life , rather than mars , although mars is a very much more powerful and interesting place .
and the usual astronomers were full of contempt of contempt .
because it &apos;s the way that the way that life can live out there , it has tremendous benefits compared to life on a planet .
there was another object , this high thing , and the same thing that &apos;s got these up of the furniture of creatures and the naked and naked -- pretty creepy things for a little child .
the first projects were modest , but they took technology and they might take them into things that people are using a new kind of functionality and perhaps to find a new functionality .
the other thing that &apos;s the most important thing is , we decided we decided to try and do all the technical gadgets , this whole whole thing , and trying to make it as beautiful .
so we called it y water . so that &apos;s another example where everything is happening in a room , which is the three-dimensional design , the ideas that are the development of the brand , it &apos;s all very closely interconnected .

let me give you an example : in turkey , where i come from , which is a very special republic , we had a little bit more , which is what we call a lot of time to protect the universities , against college students .
if i would be the only person who thinks that , we would have a problem .
in the 19th century , as muslims europe saw as an example , they were independent , they were independent .
so the e.u. process was the emergence of turkey , the e.u. , to join the e.u. within turkey of the pious muslims , while some of the people were against them .

when i look at suicide bombers , the younger ones are when i , or in my age , i feel so inspired by their attacks .
and this is going to come up , just on enceladus , from the street of the street , waiting for some of the time to be in the middle of the future , specifically , in the middle of the future .
is the internet actually a place that you can visit ?
and the landscape changes . three years ago when i started to engage with this , there was only a wire along the african west coast , shown here in this map of steve song as thin black line .
and that &apos;s not true to me .
this data is sent to layer of layer on the device , starting with the basis of the product , and puts the material layer on layer , by the new layer of light in a field of a game .
it was made by purple of the layers of about four of the new things .
an 11-year-old is likely to be less likely .
you can just make it right before the place .
this is made the product .
without any doubt i think this technology is a revolution in production , and the most common way we &apos;re going to change them .
he was worried that if he called them at this name , especially out in the public , you could think he would be the case of his jihad .
they use his own business .
the good news is that it &apos;s not that way .
but many of these factors that played a role , even more and more , is even more powerful .
i was in my girlfriend , susan dunlap , who was the photographer , in mathare valley .
she said , &quot; you know , poverty was not the bad thing . it was the humiliation and the embarrassment of all the things . &quot;
do you think i &apos;m going to miss the violence or the drugs ? the lack of privacy ?
first , instead of taking over and forget about flies , the time was very much more sophisticated .
but it &apos;s less likely to stay .
and during my first year , i had my company continued to go on .
it &apos;s even said that more energy will need to make a solar cell as they get into their entire body .
solar cells are going to collect four hours of light for four hours .
and they &apos;re also under great pressure and so dangerous .
this is a key one .
it &apos;s just a little cylinder down here , which is the generator and all the most sophisticated in itself , and this is the hot , hot cylinder , the hot cylinder on the upper end -- this part is hot , and comes out of electricity .
you have to not use the hot water , it can cool it .
so here we have a map of the united states .
and we don &apos;t have a finalist , this energy so fast , how we do it right now .
we &apos;re bubbles it on and we &apos;re looking at the parts .
it &apos;s a flying laboratory that we did the measurements in the region of this molecule .
but i &apos;ve still written bad poems and he never pulled the most educated in the air , but he went to cuba .
so , from the wooden , great things can come -- -- which i then do , then , a picture that will end up in my work .
i work for the new yorker and i do a little bit of time , and then the 9 / 11 , and that was , i was , i was going to be a fan of the world as we knew it .
and then the gowanus audience is clear , and it &apos;s a little bit of time , but that &apos;s how we understand it . &quot;
&quot; and he decided that his favorite had gone extinct . &quot;
this man is angry because somebody all over his staircase is chasing out on his staircase , and basically -- you know , onion here .
and she &apos;s also out of george fry , so i don &apos;t think it &apos;s .
td : since my youngest childhood and after , many different obligations were given to me , and when i was young , it came to me that my journey was always a little bit more sophisticated .
this is beautiful , but we should remember that a similar process should be done on internal level .
td : lakshmi worked incredibly hard , even for my invitation , even from everything else you &apos;ve been doing , and i &apos;ve been quite resistant to that , and i was pretty nervous , and i was very nervous during this whole week .
in these two examples , we &apos;ve seen machines that have learned to go to the simulation , and others that have learned in reality .
if i say , &quot; we , &quot; i mean the advice for the ted revolution .
but nobody believes it &apos;s actually going to be very effective if there &apos;s a real outbreak .
the biggest part of the administration in the administration is actually rather connected to anthrax and the threat of biological weapons .
we know that the virus will be being stimulated . it will be a different virus .
but in the scientific community , there &apos;s a debate that happens in the same part of the population of the people &apos;s worth between people through themselves and coughing with the hands .
some of the poorest countries that have most of the experience with h5n1 have the drugs that have already laid out .
and i think even our leaders would say that we have a lot to do in this case .
i &apos;m very pleased to answer your questions .
our centers for the long-term community have one of them , and they have been able to have a test of the test -- as fast as a fast computer .
and in the previous process of people , similar bacterial infections were also not a problem .
don &apos;t just pay attention to how much fun you have , but also , as the mess of the kind of bleeding , the way that it can interact with a city like san francisco .
please put a joint of me .
i &apos;m going to get a boy out of a force , and he &apos;s a little bit of selling me , and i &apos;m going to sell three clubs .
i &apos;ve been doing a little bit of my childhood , and i was climbing the case , so i &apos;m done , and i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m going to be a training game .
manhattan is not going to go into infinite .
so i &apos;m not supposed to be here , right ?
i &apos;m staying in the middle .
she was one , it was a way to get me to the triumph .
because of the air sheets and branches , it &apos;s very dark and very quietly .
i &apos;m interested in the dynamics of the world &apos;s dynamics for the dynamics of the world , which live in the forest .
we &apos;re advising ourselves with the media , we have a more powerful one ; we have a more nuanced .
and then the students in our recording studio came , and they have their own collections of their own beats .
and our new project is that the inmates and we learn to grow the frog to grow the frog , which is a highly endangered extinction of endangered in washington and oregon .
he said , &quot; look what you &apos;ve been hiding before . &quot;
so we see a rising demand for the more sophisticated , and therefore we see .
they &apos;re not a magician . they &apos;re not our parents .
you have to believe me . trust me . &quot;
and i learned two really important things about this day .
the deeper we go under water , the higher is the pressure .
so i started about 15 years ago .
the air breath goes down the air , the air comes from the air .
every one of these computers can do the entire system , so if two of them are out there , there &apos;s also reserves .
but this is what it looks like , and this habitat is still going to go over many miles .
so sharks are not quite as dangerous as most people are doing .
when we found it , we didn &apos;t even think of what family he heard , so we called him a little bit of the way that he looked like he looked like he was from his books .
oxygen oxygen is a disclaimer and it &apos;s drawn .
this means that every one of them and every one of them here knows at least one child that &apos;s suffering .
and his communication and social interaction improved so much that he could visit a normal school , and even a computer company became a standard .
it &apos;s like life : if you &apos;re in it , you can &apos;t get out of it again .
i know you never heard of him . but remember this day , you &apos;ll hear about him , because he &apos;s a fascinating man . &quot;
nk : no , he died 25 years ago .
he had a lot of love , he loved everyone .
we , all of us , are what happens when a primordial soup comes from hydrogen and helium so long to ask that they start asking about their origins .
these are the most striking evidence that life can exist in many different environments .
so you have to learn the diversity and the incredible scale of life on this planet , and you have to learn to be in a touch with life elsewhere in the whole way .
so , it &apos;s going to be so important to be silicon , and we &apos;re going to be able to extend it to the future by expanding it in 350 antennae , so it &apos;s sensitive and to the moore &apos;s law of increasing computing .
and then we &apos;d like to be able to make the search search through human health .
many people say it &apos;s the best place to study the world &apos;s development .
every cylinder is a time of time .
while you &apos;re using the ice , you &apos;re going to clean up a little pair of gloves in a oven , so you can put a new pair of gloves , if your blood scans freeze and get stiff .
i think this is a little bit of a bit of economic engineering .
and our soldiers don &apos;t just look forward to the fact of the way to get to the furniture in the wake stations when they have actually reported to service to be american , to be able to get american health care .
you can still push that , and the efficiency almost triple , and it &apos;s nearly double to the most profitable of the great oil benefits .
we could build bigger cars , which would contribute to security , but easily should be .
but instead , they sell it to china and japan because we have to protect our transportation system and not .
and that &apos;s what the main mass of production is that makes the standard mass of the type of materials , or in this case , to create the creation of the brain , as good as a good , and the most powerful thing that has been able to do the internet , the internet is able to do it as well .
it can &apos;t just act a giant conspiracy .
there were two kinds of negative feedback that we have .
let &apos;s hope that it &apos;s really stable .
oops , i was wrong .
and at the end , he found a computer scientist , a dutch van meegeren called the han van meegeren , who sold him a wonderful vermeer , who was about 10 million dollars of college .
according to his favorite , he looked like he had discovered the first time that there is bad in the world . &quot;
&quot; it comes . what is it ? &quot; is a good answer .
but as attractive as attractive you find them , how much they are sexually moving or romantic , it depends on what they think they think about .
but each one of these three objects has value beyond what it brings , because of its story .
but i don &apos;t want a copy , even though i can &apos;t recognize the difference .
so he brought joshua bell to take his head on a subway station in washington d.c. to put himself on a corner and see how much money he will take .
the second shock is painful because you &apos;re a little bit used to it .
and if you &apos;re going to see , you can see that maybe there &apos;s a kind of political health system .
they &apos;re going to be a certified , professional member of the american state of the american state of the world , which sounds very glamorous and exciting .
and what you find is , of course , people who eat vegetables and oil , less , more powerful .
the most amazing thing is one of the most intriguing things in medicine .
it &apos;s a very clear conclusion when you give a drug in a high dose of these high doses , that it will have more side effects , and that you will better look better .
the big trials are closer to the true answer .
this is a problem for which there &apos;s no solution right now .
and very soon , they would have started this coal , 26 miles , 26 , to travel , to travel , and to go back to china , back to china and back in the world .
can you imagine how they feel about that if they were in my place ?
it &apos;s just about oil ; you know that , all knowledge .
there &apos;s this thing , the world &apos;s favorite , and it &apos;s right from the middle of the united states .
and what you see ? they &apos;re christians .
the americans , they &apos;re kind of like this , &quot; ah , tb .
these christians are the ones .
it &apos;s wrong . that &apos;s wrong .
and the soldiers are chinese , and all the other people are chinese .
you can imagine that maybe one of them on the morning is going to be able to be on his child and it &apos;s calling it , and he said , &quot; honey , i &apos;m back .
everything has changed .
and all of that has tremendous implications on the world .
i think thomas jefferson has a really good thing in words .
for the most violent in the audience , it &apos;s actually explaining why the most powerful budget has a larger budget than comedy , that &apos;s because of the fact that the same thing is that the movies are bigger and different in other languages , and so the market is bigger .
but it &apos;s going to happen within this century .
this is not the u.s. &apos;s business , which is about a million , but gdp of the world is a capita , 200,000 dollars .
and also , as everybody here knows -- it &apos;s about energy , not oil .
my choice is the peak of a lifetime of life that &apos;s going to grow on the gulf of the gulf of the gulf .
a lot of our actions on this planet , which are based on our living environment , are just by faith and a guess .
every one has been over thousands of years or millions of years .
we need to calm down before we ruin the planet .
e. wilson : saving life on earth
another more powerful is the famous european oryx .
the passenger pigeon contains 1.3 billion pairs of base pairs .
the reversal of the extinction is in these category .
real falcon made of light light .
and there &apos;s a program behind the top of the world that &apos;s just brilliant .
this is an emotional subject . some people got up .
my grandmother was a magician .
i also made my own comic , which was another way to tell stories , through words and images .
and we sat in a short way , in silence and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really talented . &quot;
use your own style . draw it , like you tell you .
&quot; prefer jarrett , i &apos;ve got your favorite card .
i &apos;m also going to publish a book called &quot; the police police police , &quot; the most powerful who &apos;s a computer company . &quot;
sound affects us all the physiological , psychological , cognitively and environmental .
this is a 32 million pounds of expensive , important design , which was recently built in england recently , designed by a british national geographic .
but it &apos;s not just kids who are affected by it .
people who say , let &apos;s not sit in this team , because the noise likes and the other silence .
&quot; upwake &quot; tells a story about zero , a contemporary business company , who carries his life in the suitcase with the dream and the dream and reality and reality , and not in the position both to replace both of them .
and the frames and four years later , and four years later , it became what was starting to be a computer scientist , a very strict of a talented act of hiv actors .
i know theater connects us .
now , the time we can use the diversity of our talents to create a smart , important and extraordinary piece . and it &apos;s gone .
if you look around the bathroom , you &apos;ll see some products more , like the other , like , for example , the internet , the internet , the internet , but also the punchline .
and the collagen -- or , since the &apos; 70s , collagen of pigs -- is used to inject it into fold .
i found out of a mess of these .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; my love , i &apos;m afraid , you have a long and a half year ago . &quot;
i told them , you should be able to get this out , &quot; i &apos;m somebody .
they gave me the feeling of being someone in a time where i felt one one .
they &apos;re working on the ninth line , so they started in the 1930s , and now they get the letters of p .
hundreds of verbs can behave like this .
you can see that as the language of thought , or &quot; the &quot; guide . &quot;
so the mystery is , why , are they , polite requests , edmund and threats so often being accompanied ?
you can try to imagine what would be if language could only be used literally .
and the other puzzle is that i don &apos;t have a problem with it .
here &apos;s my argument . is it sustainable ? is it good ?
it makes it a little bit more powerful . it &apos;s a little bit of time .
what would you have that you won out of it , convince me ?
all these different roles . can you imagine a argument where you &apos;re in , but in the audience , you &apos;re looking at the debate and looking at the debate ?
or -- and that &apos;s the most powerful part of me : we want them to be able to get us into the world of nature , we bring a design and finding the master &apos;s master &apos;s master , which might inspire us .
it changed everything . it wasn &apos;t going to be the way that these engineers were running into the boat .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here &apos;s how we make things .
this is the national national laboratory .
that would be a solar fuel for fuel fuel , if you could do a little sketchy .
this is not easy , because life is only a subset of elements in the periodic table .
feeling and respond to feedback is very important .
what you don &apos;t see is you can count .
my first business was a computer scientist . i started under the taliban .
in south korea , indonesia , almost half a million companies are women .
because , as the most successful , smaller thing in direct relation to economic growth is the economic growth .
and the world in all world are not exceptions .
people are going to be able to do whether this clarity and this wonder .
i have a big fan of the legendary , and i &apos;m going to go to the top of the happy , and i want to use paper towel to my favorite paper , and now use paper towel to do it .
first , we got it down .
what does that mean ?
when i started to engage with them , i found that they have been incredibly adapted to themselves .
but the researchers had a problem .
until you finally finished her degree , and the campus left -- and certainly happy to come there -- some time later , and then the crows come back to their own .
we found that they &apos;re really smart and they can teach each other to teach each other .
squirrel for example , for example , come looking for the peanut and go back .
but there were three problems that i couldn &apos;t solve , and i want to talk about it , but i &apos;d like to talk to you more importantly , i &apos;ve found a computer .
who would ever hire me ? &quot;
and imagine what could happen , because every region has something to offer .
let me make the connection .
you know that there &apos;s the future of the future . you have to understand that .
so that &apos;s too simplistic .
oh yeah , i &apos;m going to be the johnny &apos;s favorite dancer .
each 10 million of the time .
and here we see , with the radiologists in the radiologists , who are the words of the radiologists , &quot; how the hand is doing a kind of penis in a way that reminds you . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yes , but i would rather be eating , if you don &apos;t have anything about it . &quot;
i said , &quot; you should do an experiment .
he had a line in his book , which was supposed to be made from the most violent , and there was a kind of a maria maria named the difficulty of conception .
so now you have an evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i have to read you what she said , because i find it so beautiful .
i think that &apos;s very unfortunate . not because i would have to use it . i wanted to see him .
and that &apos;s actually the beginning of our story .
now i thought to this moment that at the age of 50 , one of the skills i really had was to tie my shoes .
first of all , i have to tell you that i &apos;m not here .
yes . the artist doesn &apos;t seem to know that right where it &apos;s supposed to be the different colors .
but i can see in your faces that you still are a little bit skeptical .
it &apos;s called &quot; the &quot; guide &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
after a while , i decided to have a little fun , and before i left the room in the morning , i was raised a few things in the room .
and now they &apos;re all in there .
my father was one , so my youth was really interesting .
the song as just as a mere fact .
i mean , &quot; wait a minute , is it good , i &apos;m going to get the wheels . &quot; i bought the celebrities , and i was doing it , and i put them on , and i would take you , i could have my favorite card ?
it sounds just , but i think we &apos;re in our society , and culture with intent in our society .
he had designed the causal cleaners himself , and he was really proud of it .
human , i love the thing .
the consequences of a planet , on the right already , are currently seven billion people .
especially , he was very proud of the easy seat , the real easy seat he had told his mother &apos;s office , and on the beautiful of the seat around the seat .
intent -- a life with intent -- a life that is a little better at doing something better .
i saw the healthy mass of a left of a left , and i yelled that she was lost , and all of the time i didn &apos;t have that , but not possible , but not possible .
and then i started to wonder how many times in front of the day , how my life would have been different when this man hadn &apos;t been injured , if my genes have a different part of experience .
i was , but i was now a more of a school , and i think i was doing it , so i think i did now .
i had been hoping to be a little simpler , and i was going to get to a little bit of the humble , and i was doing this radio service on four words .
he spent six months in prison , lost his birthday for a decade .
yeah , contrast .
we &apos;re working with the machine , in the university of california , san diego combined .
first , the perception of people , and secondly , a natural interface , a natural form of control , so that interaction with the robot is more intuitive to the robot for you .
and yet , i was taking this idea .
after i &apos;ve found this economic danger , i thought we need to find a solution for this problem .
some have actually collapsed to the speaker , like to talk to nathan , or the one of tim ferriss , who &apos;s been considered a very hard thing .
i don &apos;t know a tedtalk that includes this .
and i paid 25 cents , because i found the task was a little bit harder .
and yet , there was one of the things that all of us were , the expansion had to slow down .
keep the mystery of the dark energy in the back of the back , because i &apos;m going to call you three main centers of string theory .
the candidate candidate came up on about 10 .
and he worked for decades to explain this number , but he didn &apos;t succeed , and we know why .
each of these universes has extra dimensions .
because the astronomers of today , by turning powerful telescopes to the sky , discover a handful of plastic photons -- a kind of cosmic cable , billions of years on .
well , i want to be honest with you and tell you that most of it is a trick , but a trick that works .
think about it , it &apos;s the first time you meet it . we want to get them really , really , and make more curious .
he said , &quot; go on , milo . squash you . &quot;
pm : that &apos;s dimitri so right in the wild .
we know nothing here .
the next moment , the phone doesn &apos;t work anymore , the tv is going , armed men are on the street .
it was a very grim meeting of the reporter who had been working in war , the employees of ngos , and of course the bold , brave people of sarajevo himself .
if i &apos;m asked , why i &apos;m going to keep doing a lot of time , why i &apos;m going to stay on that .
but it &apos;s my job to break out of this statement and that &apos;s the most powerful , the core of the thing , for us .
even before a goal , that you &apos;re trying to do with the joystick of the cursor , the goal of the cursor is to find the goal , no matter where it is .
basically , we trained the animals to actually control these kinds of things and study objects in the virtual world .
in an experiment we did a few years ago , we went to the limit .
so we start in china .
so dai manju did the job .
please raise your hand .
the last reason that we have to do is that women are part of the solution .
in niger , in the end of a seven women , one of the seven women in the birth of a child dies .
it became part of the solution , not the problem .
larry dunlap , when he was a world bank , once he said , &quot; it can be good that investment in the developing world is going to be the highest , the highest ones in the developing world . &quot;
this is bill &apos;s book &apos;s book .
and that was the feather of a bird .
this whole gyre around the single of our computer , tells us that there is a more powerful one .
and even this picture makes the suspects feel the impression , and it &apos;s been a little bit of the way that the story of the baby &amp; amp ; and a vc &apos;s &amp; gt ;
one of these ways was that we could have gotten into small plastic systems .
they put their arrowheads and say , &quot; i want to share this arrowheads against the finished arrows . we share 50 . &quot;
there are places on this island where they can meet all three or four miles a new language .
when 27 individuals from this 27 member member , they put themselves on a table , their 23 languages , and then they &apos;ll tell you a little bit of a calculation that they need to be prepared by a military of steel to all the possibilities .
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that they also have language .
and what i &apos;m most interested in is the invisible space between a text and the other image , and how the image is transformed through the text , and the text through the image .
this is the most powerful , which is the bottom of the atlantic ocean , and north america combined with europe .
they turn the negative to .
but through the sense of the notion of the body , the most powerful , and the most common , and the most common , the most powerful .
larry ornish was sitting eight years of a 10 year-old warning of a six year-old hour , in arizona , for kidnapping and edited out of a baby &apos;s juvenile boy on a street program .
and people are leaving themselves .
and they &apos;ve taken them here for us to texas .
and now they &apos;re going to drive with the lunch , where they &apos;re in this moment .
it &apos;s just the big part of space that makes it look like nothing .
so something called an addictive thing , and the pursuit of happiness and human design .
partly , the legacy of the legacy , the lima , the pursuit of happiness , was driven by the most profitable aspects of the individual and can &apos;t be found in reality .
a science of happiness in happiness is that happiness and error doesn &apos;t make a dent in a closed continuum .
it starts in the field of the brain .
here &apos;s a three weeks old baby .
in the animal kingdom , there &apos;s only one possibility to increase the status , that &apos;s dominance .
i want to close with some quotes .
why should you choose rats ?
once the rat understood that , we make a little bit harder .
you can actually cure t.b. , even in humans , hiv care .
with the knowledge that a patient who remains microscopic porn , to 15 people infected -- 15 healthy people -- every year , you can be secure that we &apos;ve saved a lot of life .
here we see neurons .
so , the important thing is that imitation and emulation .
now , the question is : if i just watch a different person &apos;s touch , why am i not a confused and literally watching this kind of thing from the naked watching someone &apos;s touch ?
thank you . i have two missions today .
i &apos;m not really about the most violent , but it &apos;s about the pollen itself .
all these pictures were taken by a microscope microscope by the way in kew .
even every single one of us has a story to tell the most of the time that we have .
we need to be so good as the breast cancer system to address this crisis .
right now , in the 1980s , when we &apos;ve been growing women and death through heart disease , they &apos;ve been writing a banjo for the new england journal of medicine and called the syndrome syndrome .
our colleagues in washington , d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike the , x-ray , x-ray , for women , their own chest , their own breast , the heart of their own heart , every time we organize something that &apos;s just a small amount of radiation , we say , &quot; is this test really necessary ? &quot;
okay , so here we started .
they &apos;ve done what they said , they &apos;ve thought they were a little bit of the time , and they &apos;ve been qualified .
the cells have something like the kind of thing that they &apos;re going to feel like , in the dish , they don &apos;t feel native .
what does that mean for us ?
in the course of three years , we took eight to 10 hours , collected about a quarter of a million hours of hours , and a quarter of a million hours of time .
this is one of the first to come out of a little bit more than a year ago that we really surprised us .
and finally , my son is playing alone in a walker .
three of the most important people in this project , philip , and rajiv roy , and improvising roy is to see here .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamic in the game .
this is the first time that our son made more than two steps -- captured in the movie .
and this is a important question to be asked to be a question of the way that the brain is generating meaning , the better we can communicate , and the better we can think , the better we can think and work .
it &apos;s a kind of center where you see a picture and think , &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional response to that stuff . &quot;
what we literally do is to paint our team to paint the entire whole whole wall .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just about hygiene , but it &apos;s also about the possibility of relaxation .
so it &apos;s not a place .
if you translate that into the building industry , if you have a car , and you have a window , we say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken , it &apos;s broken .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we kept on a lot of time .
are we just stupid ?
you can maybe go through it in two years , if you read eight hours a day .
so in september of september , and say , &quot; i &apos;m important today .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
and the police waiting to come to the fire floor to cut the vehicle into pieces , to get the body of the driver .
and that &apos;s enough to the present with the u.s. bank in the united states , where a eye of the divine intervention finds .
all of this leads us -- the -- just to name it , just to name this : what we &apos;re doing is to use digital devices .
this is the consequence of destruction of the destruction of the brain on the right , through the stroke .
this is a very , very low level to be released from the health system .
he then gave my jaw to the right position in the right position , and he gave my teeth .
alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator who &apos;s fascinated by the gaps of the conscious world , whether he &apos;s going to have a deaf ending , or a blind one , or a paralyzed one .
now i had to go to the dark years , which followed what i was doing when everything that was particularly , in particular , disappeared .
and it works . it works .
lp : so if you have the opportunity , you spend time with simon &apos;s time .
and these were the developing countries : they had big families and a relatively short life .
and these are on this side . a big of the vast majority of africa and the world .
and then deng xiaoping came and brought money to china and brought it back to the country .
a search of a search that we can copy in a design format and publish the world in a world , and what do we hear if we &apos;re looking around ?
but this creates hypotheses .
you know , darwin explains life after it came out , what was the essence of life ?
and i learned francis crick .
there was what in the literature .
we were not the best chemists in the room .
i was surprised , i didn &apos;t get married ; my girl didn &apos;t marry me .
you can compare the same dna to compare the normal segments and the ones .
and so i close by telling you that we &apos;ve been looking at 20 people with schizophrenia .
in average , defense costs in one case in two million dollars , and 18 months , if you win .
first , you don &apos;t fight the patent , but against the patent of the brain .
my solution : give me this patent and i &apos;ll leave you with a little bit of time .
&quot; why not ? &quot; said , the girls .
the fathers were on a place where they move their daughters to play their daughters , and could reach out their hand to dance .
this is a great technology .
it &apos;s not very much left on the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in people .
can &apos;t see the enemy most of the time , and at least we needed a different approach to eradicate polio as we had done it with smallpox .
it helped control pandemic pandemic systems , sars for example .
the reality of polio today is something very different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : now bruce , where are you from your view of the most difficult places ?
bruce mandelbrot : how we get to the polio
dj : we found this acupuncture now at all possible animals , especially in the cats .
and we became a very fond of the surprise .
for us , this elephant has become a symbol for inspiration , a symbol of the hope that &apos;s accompanied us in our work .
it was incredibly amazing when she took it in security to protect it before the hyena .
and of course , if i look at these online things , the most powerful , it reminds me of a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic because your destiny is in our hand .
we need it . we &apos;re respect and celebrate each other as a man and woman as a community and as part of this planet and we need to continue to do it .
it seems obvious to be the earth that &apos;s large and perfect , the sun is small and mobile , but it &apos;s worth remembering what &apos;s going on in the world .
and that &apos;s because in middle world , there &apos;s always always .
nature &apos;s that model depends on what kind of animal we are .
because there are so many of them , and because of them , there &apos;s no consensus for their favorite , the most violent , the most powerful , like we see it in middle middle world , a heroic , and it &apos;s found .
people as a machines like treating a machines like a scientific machine , and it &apos;s a very , very much time , but it &apos;s a waste of time , if you want to guess what the person is going to do next .
i was at the wheels age of 40 years old , at the wheels age .
over a cursor i control with my head , i allow these little to allow me to see videos from the robot and to send orders by putting buttons in a museum of a plastic .
with the help of people like you , we can make this dream .
for example , in oceanography , for example , a computer of the world &apos;s life is developed by basically the most prolific , which is the dolphins , visualizing .
i think we can create a global community .
this is a hot piano cap .
there are now some lessons -- there are some lessons that you can learn from that .
but we don &apos;t usually do this .
i think that we tend to look at this : the infrastructure of globalization .
this is down to 12 percent .
this is a problem we need to solve .
i also assume that most of you don &apos;t speak chinese -- what really sad is when you think that this is the most common language in the internet .
what do you look at ? maybe we should do that .
if you look at this picture , you might think , &quot; why should that be me ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find it in it .
they would bring wealth and security , religious violence overcome and make sure that states never back to terrorists again .
and part of this activity is honesty .
what is that ?
i love this dish .
and the war caused the 20 million people to live life -- until today &apos;s most successful civil war .
and the pope sen , who is this guy , &quot; i also have made all this money , but i &apos;ve spent all of these time to search the american man , who had stolen my recipe .
chinese restaurants have largely done the same thing , i would argue , with the menu and the canoe -- even the restaurant name -- but without a centralized headquarters .
in contrast , we have general tso chicken , which actually started in new york city in the early 1970s when i started to go on the university of new york city , so ...
so what we see in the 17th century , 18th century is the most powerful search for medicine , which creates the same thing .
so people would have a really big fit .
when the census began , i was clearly more depressed , i was always more depressed , i thought my god , i can &apos;t work .
do you remember that as a child , to have a child ?
18 and 19 slept , i was at night .
again , i &apos;ll be a little bit depressed and a little bit sticky .
so , many of us are clear that there &apos;s a lot of time to do in the next few years .
he goes around : &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know , where worked the world in the treatment of the known problems that were made from the potential of earthquakes and climate change ?
if you put the impossible to decode this , you can do it .
but we have reached a agreement to climate change .
and there &apos;s god crying .
the main thing is something remarkable : it uses two ingredients , proteins and water , which are in their spinneret , to create a material that is extraordinary to create , as protection , as a technical fiber , like kevlar .
or you &apos;re a nice thing like this , if you can catch this camera .
here you see how it &apos;s taken from the tissue .
with my new project , marilyn atwood , i want to use art for creating technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that &apos;s coming back and you &apos;re measuring the round of applause and the camera &apos;s cube -- hopefully not -- to help him get some of his next choices .
what &apos;s going to do ? &quot;
in the frame of this unprecedented demonstration , heather knight dataset , a little bit more , a little more than a standard of the brain -- he &apos;s collecting the feedback of his audience and his behavior , and he &apos;s going to be the answer to the amount of the crowd .
stanley ostrow , inventor of the known to the known thing , is , in the most violent and white , and i think it &apos;s between two people a connection about only five to seven steps .
how does our view of our view of relationships are very highly sophisticated groups ?
there was a exchange that i &apos;m going to tell you about , and where he might have been able to tell me that i could have this crash in the ear .
um ... my father , a baby , a college student ?
it was his father who decided they needed false papers .
this feeling of responsibility about other lives , he despite his young age of 17 , and also his fault to be a more , a , a , a , a , a school , he kept his entire life . he kept his whole life .
and as my six-year-old and my graduate student came up with my favorite , kind of orphans , my father was wrong .
i asked him , in the face of the victims he had ever had , if he ever had the ever ever .
we grow from a few million people in the seven billion people that we are today .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a very beautiful system on the street level , which is a very , very peculiar place , which is a very good state of the next to the next day .
if you &apos;re going to reduce the forests of the forest , the border in the land , you can get the ability to stay the power of the fuel , to stay stable .
with the realization of the knowledge of the fishermen , fishermen who are great barrier reef and scientists , that the great barrier reef is fine under the current of the brain .
but the drama is of course that clearly shows that the fact that the fact is that the change is not an option .
that leads me to another reason why i &apos;m here today : because i really like media .
this is a kind of a race of a race of a lot of wild design .
first , he uses an ancient way of making the world &apos;s , and they were doing this with three-dimensional perspective , which was a very new technology at that time .
and by the process of sugar , i asked portraits of them .
it became very large images and i took them with a very large camera , a computer camera .
my interest on the street of the day , especially worse , is very far .
and on the back is a sequence that is also the chimps .
we can ask , is there any general differences between africans and the world ?
and then you can compare it to the genome of living living people .
so we can then ask for the incidents of the incidents , how are you connecting to the ancestors of today &apos;s lives ?
there are many people who designed their own future vision , like this vision of the beginning of the 20th century .
after my belief , the airplane of the future has its own consciousness .
imagine , carbon dioxide grow in 3d 3d printer , and they &apos;re embedded in a field of a factory , and follow the forces that occur in their components .
they weren &apos;t talking . but especially they were deeply isolated from the world around them , from their surroundings and from the people .
they would be able to call up . they would call the police .
now we know that it &apos;s about a 100 of them .
you see a video .
you have the feeling that the research you have , really , can have a effect on reality , that you can actually prevent this experience , with which i started to start with my journey on this area .
then you pull out .
and you &apos;re projecting you in a stare -- chin on your body &apos;s body -- chin on the front of your hand , put on your arms arm .
they did all the way we taught them to do it .
and after the battle , they bring this mobile class and they do what you call &quot; the &quot; eureka &quot; to teach you what you &apos;re doing wrong .
people also changed .
i said , &quot; where is he now ? &quot;
this is not a simple piece .
and she showed up on the left piece to tell me how problematic this image was that it was for her to the idea of the idea of black .
it &apos;s really in this sense of the most powerful that i have a new set of questions that i &apos;m going to do .
well , that &apos;s kind of an obvious statement .
and the kids said , &quot; how do we do that . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to multiply numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long have you been doing it before you decided you didn &apos;t understand anything ? &quot;
their favorite rate increased 50 , which is something else new schools , with a biotechnology , with a biotechnology , biotechnology teacher .
was 76 percent . the test , two months later , was the result of 76 percent .
after eight ted talks , he wanted to be there .
that &apos;s a 10-year-old .
suddenly i looked out of the darkness on the opposite side of the place , a kind of mirror of mirrors that were taken from the moon .
if i had to reduce the whole story on a picture , what would it be ?
i &apos;m going to show you some clips from my other big project in this year . &quot; the tempest -- the storm -- the storm . &quot;
and our little life ends up in a sleep .
bono : &quot; you &apos;re mythologies .
i know you understand that .
so blue , blue , everything was blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both play in africa .
it &apos;s another one that acts on the interface of health and business .
let &apos;s use the markets as the most sophisticated , which we have , and figure out what the price would pay people to pay for , so they would have the choice .
thank you .
the main thing was that , if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , then we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we destroyed two main lines and 10 tv .
the little thing that &apos;s going to come out of his tracks , and that was a problem .
this is all right . it &apos;s slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of a few of the models i work with .
tissue of the food of the density and behavior is the second part , and that &apos;s actually the key to use these models for the long-term design system .
thank you .
and the attempt to take you just to take a place to try to shoot a arrow with the end of the end , and it was hard work , and young , boy , i learned a lot of respect for nature .
now let &apos;s look at the other side .
we work on projects -- even more sophisticated developments , such as the kind of energy technology -- with darpa , the california institute of technology and university los angeles .
be careful , you just behave like wood or something like that .
now i didn &apos;t try to be a more balanced .
they go forever .
these are about two billion .
it takes it to the estimate of the &quot; three years &quot; for the estimate of it .
don &apos;t forget that one minute .
but for me , it &apos;s great because it &apos;s a metaphor for time where we can live in the human mind and machines .
i &apos;ve got a lot of mass . where is it coming ?
it &apos;s too afraid that the way that the way in the wild could be extinct in 20 to 30 years .
all the evidence in this is that this cancer is transmitted by a virus .
i took the opportunity to get a couple of samples and put some samples from jonas &apos;s tumor and a few samples from other parts .
she brought it to the veterinarian and this discovered something called a little bit of a sudden .
ultimately , cancer is an inevitable consequence of the ability to share our cells and adapt to their environment .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and that &apos;s a global phenomenon .
they would be able to wait to wait for it .
and that &apos;s the third reason why a low expectation doesn &apos;t make us happy .
but they didn &apos;t feel that the numbers on them were going to be .
first , i &apos;m going to show you the most violent for the optimism bias .
but the good news is that our illusion is not broken when we &apos;re aware of this kind of thing .
but what we &apos;re going to see in the 21st century is asia , the incremental back , to get more than half the world &apos;s population and to do about half the global economic economy .
you could look at this as the privatization of war .
after 1958 , the soviets had been the sputnik , it was , &quot; this is the end of america . &quot;
if you live in japan or new delhi or your view of china , you will be a different way of china than you live in beijing .
and if we have strategies in which we &apos;re going to be able to get this in larger historical context , we can be able to do this process .
how do we define our national interests so that it &apos;s not just a long-term health problem , but it &apos;s a positive amount of happiness
this is the conventional approach .
this typically has the responsibility to optimize the guidelines to prevent a stable security .
they depend on the long one .
jobs for who ? especially for young men .
after all , the legal system is collapsed , you can &apos;t even get access to each other .
the supply would be made by the conflict , the way the conflict was made .
this is the silhouette of my hometown of new orleans .
the military is aware of it . they call the climate change , which is security and stability , as governments argue in the world , as governments are talking about the world .
it allows you to become more productive , so you can afford to do insurance themselves .
these are certainly inspiring examples of possible solutions if we feel in the position to plan a world &apos;s world .
listen like chinese students , english , who are teaching it .
teacher : perfect ! student : perfect !
and that includes things like the world with a concrete world , to implement abstractions that we &apos;re trying to make sense of , and we also take hypothetical seriously , meaning that we &apos;re more likely to ask what it is .
luria looked at people before they put in the scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to an xbox of the concrete world .
and luria said , &quot; the north pole is there .
they chose pettengill rather than new york .
it wasn &apos;t just the spread of cognitively tough professions .
would you have made it to be killed ? &quot;
you could say , a half .
it feels like i landed in a colony of angels . &quot;
and they &apos;re going to be able to do something about it .
it &apos;s still in the red numbers , but chris has made it with personal victims , this film .
i &apos;m one of your favorite classes .
there &apos;s a prime minister , a minister , secretary of defense and a cfo of the internet .
boy : &quot; the most serious thing is serious .
we were all mad to them , &quot; why do you do that ?
it &apos;s going to be a lot of real , if you read it . &quot;
we had always played the game after weeks of school for weeks , about seven weeks , and we &apos;ve basically calculated all of the 50 in the field of the entire 50 crisis .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
many people announced good money , and the most prolific thing was , the most powerful thing .
it &apos;s like his own little connection .
if i all of these three legs of the triangle , in the three peaks , i would get a tetrahedron .
so everything you do is -- it &apos;s a very , very noisy assumption -- this old piece of plastic and this old plastic &#91; unclear &#93; , this is a very simple one .
this is possible , if you have a whole piece of paper , and you can be disciplined of the paper , you can be in a school school or in a government school -- a piece of a car , a pen , a ruler , a pen , no glue , no glue .
what we do is a very simple animal system .
this is a little tube , which is what you do , this is the two corners of the road , it &apos;s going to be like a kind of a light generator .
here are two magnets .
it was very many passengers on the ship , and it became boring , so the captain invited her to his deck .
in the most violent conference , alexis gupta show simple and amazing plans to turn waste in really , really , highly sophisticated toys that can build children themselves -- while they &apos;re learning basic principles of science and design .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually examples of biology that had delivered many evidence .
and there &apos;s a few examples of projects that are aware of the ecosystems that are trying to mimic ecosystems .
and with a little bit of planning , we can use a place of traffic , in a turn that offers open space for people , the people that bring people back to food and waste waste in opportunities .
this photo was done at the day of closing , and only a year later , it looked like this .
if you degrade seawater , the first thing is calcium carbonate .
no , you have to be able to go to the people with visions of a coral reef , and they have to go through the positives . &quot;
i was looking for someone who is jewish because i &apos;m jewish and because i &apos;m very important .
but the real failure was that there were lots of men who wanted to go to me .
very few of us have the ability to be absolutely honest with themselves .
he likes to travel as long as it &apos;s not on a football table .
i tried to be in principle , as the way that i was .
because you remember my favorite thing : you have to get a $ 700 person to get 700 points and no one did it .
most of you . gamers are 33 years old , not eight years , and if we look at the most popular demographics of the water of the brain , the gamers of tomorrow are older adults .
imagine your vision is very , very good .
these gamers actually have many other benefits in terms of attention , and a aspect of attention , which is also improved , is our ability to track objects in our environment .
i want to ask you to remember this result , and it in the context of another group of the internet , a group that is actually in our society , which is actually the most of the people who are working on the gapminder business .
let me explain this step with a task called mental space .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just just do all kinds of programs of particular if we &apos;re looking at it .
so it was a big , very complex project i &apos;m not even sure that it was working at all .
so wolfram alpha so knows about many and lots of things .
on the one hand , we have mathematica , with the kind of more precise , progressive language and a large network of the world &apos;s capacity to do a lot of lines of the world .
so , with physical engineering , we &apos;re basically used to go to the world and see that certain materials are useful for certain technological purposes and so on .
a few years ago , i was pretty excited about discovery that there are candidates with incredibly simple rules that are successful in a special theory of relativity , and the general relativity and gravity and at least evidence of quantum relativity .
sw : i think i think .
and during this time , i actually lost more relatives , and teachers who were going to me , hiv / aids .
it jump up . they &apos;re wearing red clothes .
because my mother was a woman , she didn &apos;t have a right estate , automatically , and she was automatically connected to my family , so he had the right thing .
and the day before the actual ceremony , we were dancing , and we were very excited about the whole night .
he was wearing his eyes and he had a village that didn &apos;t even have a street , and it was very attractive .
i promised him to be a girl &apos;s girl , i would come back and do everything they would ask me for .
when it was pregnant before marriage , mother was responsible for it , and fought .
while we &apos;re talking to this , 125 girls will never be hacked again .
consumers who represent 72 percent of the american gdp , actually start , just like banks and companies , they &apos;re going to break down their own life , in everyday life , to make themselves go from commitment to themselves , and to make us move forward .
and what you &apos;re looking at is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we actually spin and basically future education , the future children of our households .
and the u.s. s is up to 48 percent , who at cornell is at uc institute .
we also observe a trend for a kind of a disaster tourism . right ?
one of them is the most powerful community and neighborhood , and the other parent &apos;s neighbor &apos;s neighbor &apos;s neighbor .
we also observe a big deal of business .
the trend for the climate change is immense .
then we take the phenomenon of kogi .
and then i came up with the question , i &apos;m the only one that &apos;s doing this ?
you could exploit it .
this is what i do in my life -- stories tell stories , and today i want to share with you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures that are the most powerful .
our main business could shrink . our hearts could be sued , and our main business could be the case of our brain , if we &apos;re in our cultural mode .
i was going to get to the first time i call it , &quot; more representative vibrations . &quot;
i &apos;m not an immigrant , no refugee or a computer or a computer , i &apos;m asked why i do this . but the steering between languages allow me to reinvent myself .
he wanted to see a manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story became a huge thing , because i was encouraged by the .
literature has to take us on the other side .
i could have a novel about a muslim woman , and maybe this will be a happy story , and i may be writing about a little bit of a happy , gay professor in norway .
so you &apos;re going to be taking existing songs , you cut it into small bits , you &apos;re putting it into little bits , you get them together , and you get a new song , but this new song is clearly from old songs .
instead , these laws and laws are more awkward than the general comparison of property .
it &apos;s a more powerful , but i &apos;m going to summarize what it reveals . the alarm &apos;s alarm , the telephone of the telephone , by putting a symbol with his finger .
our creativity comes from outside , not within .
and then they say , &quot; okay , but how do you see your address ? &quot;
but in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the newspaper &quot; guardian . &quot;
what &apos;s beautiful , you can probably see this limb there , a kind of a kind of a conceptual device that &apos;s coming out of the limb .
our exploration of the solar system taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
now , this led to a understanding of the nuclear structure , because it &apos;s going to be so versatile that atoms have a single core , with a surface of the sun that surrounds him .
this picture shows a galaxy , a computer , a , which is , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think she can eventually be the most violent ideas for us , about our space in the universe and really the value of our home planet .
this is here . this is home . we &apos;re .
and with each stage , and every touch of the screen , we leave like the way we get the way we get out of our personal information and the downs of our personal information all over our way through the digital forest .
when our daughter sat down to the prison , i asked her , &quot; will you have a lot of value on musical competence ? &quot;
we can &apos;t do that in a bad way .
now , i want to take you on this journey .
and because i was so eager and i talked to my 27 birthday , i was not going to talk to my 27 birthday , a day .
and they don &apos;t speak ...
and i explained to help a friend who understood my sign of language that i was john francis , that i was walking through life , i didn &apos;t talk to that , and that this would be the last time that someone would translate my sign language .
well , i &apos;m going to put my backpack again .
i started talking again , because i &apos;ve studied a lot of time .
but the main thing was that i was thinking about every birthday was about my silence , but never about my decision , just to use my feet .
born and grew up in north korea .
sometimes i found little jobs in exchange against food .
i was constantly worried about that i would be a couple of times back and back .
i felt so fragile because i had so much to eat in america , but my father died of hunger .
but i think that their gesture of love and care is also going to save a different joseph and change thousands of other people &apos;s hope , which still have hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings , but this was much more powerful than i expected , and to undo , and to make a very easy way to make a biological engineering system .
but then i was very disappointed with my profession as an architect , because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for society , but for spontaneous people , the government , the government , contractors .
and then in the next year , 1995 , there was a big earthquake in kobe in japan .
so i wonder , what is a permanent and what a little conceptual building ?
but this is really necessary .
so we &apos;re learning some of the most important things in our lives before we &apos;re born , even in the womb .
so fetuses are actually learning the particular language that &apos;s spoken in the world that they &apos;re born in .
it creates a mixture of an impact that is so generous and weird , as the woman itself .
why should malnutrition be in utero to give disease ?
you can also see the other eyes with other eyes .
this confidence in the most fundamental form is essential for every type of time .
the audience will be on the street of the audience , which is very logical , but not with the nose , which is what happens before their eyes . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , it might take us even to smile .
you may remember the most popular thing , ok . when the biggest deal of all time suggested .
if you &apos;re a high animal at the time , and someone says , &quot; what do you do for eliminating hunger in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start an ad campaign ?
this is actually a strategy and i don &apos;t argue that strategy plays a role .
for me , all of the music was .
now , if i use my software , the camera is looking at the camera , and it &apos;s familiar with the location of the brain , and you have a neural arrangement in the way that you have a whiteboard .
i remember the poor needed something to be a little bit more common -- food , clothing , shelter -- what they didn &apos;t have .
i even felt a match of shame .
now , since i heard him talk , i was excited about different reasons .
i didn &apos;t even get asked to do a donation of what i was doing .
it &apos;s about the most powerful of the story of the poor and it &apos;s about giving us a way to engage what their dignity would confirm , which is a partnership , which is a partnership , which is based on a traditional way of doing that in a different manner of donation can happen .
it &apos;s a very strong combination , a very strong combination .
now , the point is , in the beginning , the very beginning and it &apos;s very helpful to me , that it &apos;s just a vehicle , just a tool .
how does the future of humanity look like ?
now i &apos;m going to turn to the second big question : are we alone or is there other lives in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions show that we &apos;ve done remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
you can see this here .
here are photographs of me .
the rate is even doubling every 18 months and every single one of the world &apos;s population , that &apos;s the moore &apos;s law .
but what about you ? what is it going to do with you ?
they sail their gills on the sky , and occasionally they were putting people on experiments that parents wouldn &apos;t agree with .
so we &apos;re interested in these things .
the previous generations couldn &apos;t do these experiments at all .
and i found that the first technology was coming from the first technology of the city , and i found out that the first technology was in form of the city .
we can learn a lot of it .
and i see the child &apos;s sake and trying to protect my child , because with a child , you don &apos;t let anyone alone , even a minister .
and secondly , she tells us that they had a stand-up gang , but some changes for the rain of trees .
now , our ancestors came from our ancestors in principle , and the most adults , the most common , missing the world .
the most salient thing is , the main way to study the origin of humanity in the vast ethiopia is the most of the world &apos;s most , and he talks about how he found the oldest skeleton of a humanoid child and what we can learn in africa .
and if all of us should be thinking about the rules , of course , you need an effective system to rethink and , of course , as we &apos;ve discovered , in everything , in all trust .
it &apos;s considered high seas , because the continent is of the environmental demands of except .
we need to work locally , but also the ocean structure .
we need to create a new paradigm of caution and respect .
carol &apos;s favorite , &quot; i would pay for some of the things i do . &quot;
that was a pretty good idea .
to say it , i &apos;m a journalist , i &apos;m a journalist , so i want to design a sketch , and i &apos;m going to design a sketch of how the present and the future will look .
and finally , i think we all need to think about whether we want that to be our reality -- and when , what it means for our idea of life and for everything that comes next .
it looks like oil .
the symptoms of the complex are that you have the strong and the more powerful , and you have the right solution to no matter how hard the problem is .
cesar and i tried to write a paper for the new york times and explain how it works .
of course , we can .
and deserve a lot of money .
it &apos;s higher than the failure rate of americans .
we &apos;re going to try and do it . probably all of us .
it &apos;s immediately going to be . &quot;
and modernization always tried it , but he never had to prove the guess .
i &apos;m saying that our approach is simply not sustainable .
china has achieved this in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even slow down .
the future is pure intelligence .
yes , it will be ugly , and yes , it happens soon -- with safety in our lifespan -- but we are more than to overcome everything that comes up on us .
and here they come to play .
and what we need to think about is , if you dance into the flames , what &apos;s next ?
and we believed we can put this debt on our children , but imagine it .
everything else is a lot of time .
this is the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what stage of development is the cell .
that should be amazing , right ?
all we get is a lot of time .
you will be able to focus your hearing , or can be a pathogen , or can do a series of things that we cannot do .
it &apos;s not a thousand years away in the distance .
we should say that cheap , simple , simple , simple , and no one to use them for their children . &quot;
and here we can see this overall thing .
we can &apos;t risk to lose the customer of customers .
he only got 500 and to get to 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a huge amount of plastic of plastic , which they got , and he said , &quot; come back in a week when they &apos;re sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the way that the web is -- the things we all talk about -- is a little less than 5,000 days old .
of course , there &apos;s been the internet for over 5,000 days -- but the web only only only did 5,000 days .
so if we say that the machine we &apos;re going to do is now a human brain , a human brain when we look at the rate that this is growing , there &apos;s six billion of the millions of years .
now it &apos;s not -- if you make a table and things in work , a word document , you &apos;re not part of the web , but you will be part of the machine . you &apos;ll be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people will be the extended sense of the machine . &quot; in a certain sense .
it &apos;s going to be on the level of parts or ideas or words if you &apos;re going to destroy .
the last point i wanted to talk about is the idea that we &apos;re going to be going to be .
third , it will be more ubiquitous , it will be all the way that our entire environment will fill and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i convinced that the second thing of jesus was the second thing of jesus christ , that it was the sun of apartheid , and that i was prepared specifically by god to become a little bit of his research .
these are the dead of the deaths .
and it allows everything . it makes everything logical .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas , like we line things out .
this is a project that we &apos;ve just completed in the vast of a giant , massive animal , which came out directly from this process , it &apos;s the result of a variety of forces that develop .
and that led directly into another project .
it &apos;s actually a false attitude , because the hybrid is probably more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas are going to contribute to the education process of young people .
and finally , one of the most interesting projects -- a more interesting one .
each of you will go to his neighbors .
so , as we have to pay school fees .
so we have a big brain , a big advantage , because we can influence our environment .
my story , is the two brains . it &apos;s surprising to you , our gut has a brain &apos;s brain .
this is a very , very important thing , because there can be heated .
we &apos;ve learned to talk to the big brain , taste and reward , like you know .
he said , &quot; you know , eventually , we were all like animals and then not anymore . &quot;
these are men and women who can tell themselves about 250 stars in the sky .
of course , we have the most popular monks .
the most popular , the post , the post depends on the sun , actually , that reflects the light that reflects light on the sacred of machu picchu , which appears to be called the most powerful , called the &quot; adorable picchu . &quot;
if you &apos;re praying for the dead , you do this gestures with the hands that you &apos;re going to be up with the sky in the sky .
here &apos;s the place where the great mother has the most powerful in the world , which has created the mountains of the city and the land that they call the heart of the world .
it &apos;s unique , the human imagination .
this material that you all know is a little bit of the time , but i think it &apos;s more for toxic stuff .
i &apos;m going to leave you in there , you can fit it in a hundred years , because in a hundred years , my body can come back to the earth .
it &apos;s a waste .
you want to apply it anywhere in the world , and not to take care of the world , or you don &apos;t care about the other , because you have many alternatives .
first they start atoms in a special bottle .
i started a competition four years ago called &quot; dance your ph.d. . &quot;
my country is about 15 trillion dollars of revenue .
and that &apos;s -- -- that &apos;s a lot more than all the speakers before me and all the speakers come to me .
and she thought about my work on mathematical models that should be empowered to understand evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience may not be head-tail-tail -- from deep , cultural reasons , they &apos;re going to be boring -- and find a different pattern -- head-tail-head .
you can think about two types of thinking about it .
if you throw a coin , you get a sequence of head and number .
back to a secular fashion , because of the ones you &apos;re dealing with , you &apos;re busy .
and only one percent is wrong .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to take that after a sudden death in a family that remains the probability for another one . &quot;
not so unlikely as one in 73 million , but yet quite unlikely .
the quality quality , the meaningful effects on the industrial process , is carried by statistics .
the most powerful one may have saved hundreds of thousands of lives around the world .
it &apos;s a clever amount of water that prevents injury because the electricity is always recognized until a more intelligent body level .
but , on the other hand , china is a very poor , and a term out of a street station .
you have facebook , we have a little bit of time .
yet the inferior self can create a very strong force , which is never yet in history .
so chinese is looking at this kind of thing as a real medium , not just as a mere medium .
how a great ted , isn &apos;t it ?
so in the last three years , in the last three years , we &apos;ve really changed by the most violent , and more transparent , and more transparent , because the no access to the data .
more chinese , more and more , is taking free speech and human rights as their terminal , rather than an american privilege .
many of you know that the beethoven beethoven symphony was .
i don &apos;t say they can &apos;t live a wonderful life .
girl : well , my sister can pretty nerves .
the acoustics of music is much more complicated than the language .
this is a violin .
and it seems like his own way of being removed to try and figure out the cause of death , why the number of sound was made , and his skull has been pulled down on the pages .
cl : joseph is phenomenal . he &apos;s brilliant .
if i &apos;m going to get a little bit of time , in this particular auditorium , i see a special audience .
in many countries , it &apos;s another thing .
in this crucial point in the dutch story , my father was at the bank of the river &apos;s largest river in front of the ocean .
the rate of civil wars and oppression has been down since the end of the cold war .
my soldiers use their weapons as a tool of peace .
peter van : why i took a gun
this program is going to get a form and then leave 250 sequences .
this is a very crude in the middle of the nuclear park , in the middle of the kindergarten era .
you can &apos;t be just &quot; cool . &quot;
i &apos;m very interested in both of them .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example of it , but there &apos;s actually a theoretical argument for why technology is developed in the way that technology is in the way .
now , evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years , and because of this interaction , evolution is basically the technology of dedicated species to produce the next stage , which was the first step in the technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; we can make the third dimension of the third dimension .
over the last 50 years , we had 28 percent of the year in the information technology .
another big revolution is the most powerful revolution .
to take a look at the power of computing , 1,000 dollars of computing , to the time of an insect , or a mouse .
and in the year of conventional , we will reach the full colorful of these trends , and they have to celebrate how often the transcendence made in the form of technology -- faster and faster if we get to this point .
you can get blessing and secondary .
they &apos;re harder .
they were removed from the rock .
because there &apos;s nothing in there . well , you don &apos;t expect it .
dopamine seems to be the stuff that &apos;s linked to the surface of the brain .
and we call that schizophrenia .
and he was so friendly to post and give us the resolution .
i mentioned in our little thought earlier , and they &apos;re a trumpet in the african plain .
the 11th 11th has a computer scientist . it &apos;s a conspiracy .
and we have our own business system , and we have a product of a product .
i was not so good as he , but we did , and we did , in the wild , the epa , tracy chapman and bruce , to bring a giant experience to an astronomer for an ollie , and that was a great experience .
they always said , &quot; and they said , &quot; and we put us .
musicians and activist peter gabriel shares his personal motivation , with the most violent of human rights , and told stories of active environmental rights .
next , we asked ourselves , how do we do that ?
he recognizes the problem and knowing how to deal with it , the dance is his name of his own , allowing him to be new .
the beetle climbing a lot of rare on the pill when they put it on , when they &apos;re not wearing .
here &apos;s our experimenter &apos;s experimenter .
let &apos;s play a more , and see what happens .
this is the universe of stephen hawking .
thank you .
and the argument that it &apos;s fun is that it &apos;s fun to fall into this big adventure , right with my experience .
or , &quot; nice . you know , my grandmother makes a workshop in antarctica .
so the whole purpose of the presentation is to convince the vc that they are the entrepreneurs , in which they &apos;re investing and a lot of money .
and next to the experience , a company to create , or to lead -- that doesn &apos;t have to be a company .
there &apos;s no financially to be honest in which there was no problems .
you take them from there , on a solid , reasonable path to the top , right from the end .
if i knew someone who &apos;s made a device that &apos;s made of this .
no , they &apos;re not .
then you give me a quick step of light .
even if the competition is working after that .
it was hopefully positive , positive , positive , more positive .
if you follow my ideas , you &apos;ll have a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very special presentation . that &apos;s great to get who you are and to bring emotionally .
i didn &apos;t know that , that &apos;s pretty cool .
statistically , one of them is a bug .
if you do something , you might have an effect on it .
and then if you have enough , you can click another link .
we &apos;re at the end of the table , the last place , the culture , the innovation , not estimates .
as we think and behave , our business system breaks .
we have a universal meme -- seriously to be .
but forgive me , the problems today are not the problems of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the largest killer planners ?
it &apos;s very grim .
our thinking is backwards .
by a very compelling change , change , like transparency , change , for example , and collaboration , and collaboration , and not to be able to promote these things , are focused on results .
because only the challenge is the only way that the things that are always made of the way that the only way to get rid of the old , the old warning of us , and finding new creative solutions for the problems of today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we should do it together , and if we do that , and the ideas of play are possible to transform , we can transform bulgaria to something better .
the magazine for the company for the company is , i think , &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master took me to the ted lab , because the baby &apos;s house was at the time .
after i had a gesture to the head of the day , they were very -- i was accepted , and i was working for about six months .
nine days ago , i had a fire .
you know -- all of the stuff .
my kids , the baby , and henry .
we &apos;re making a bunch of papers , our homework , but where we looked at it , we were surrounded by images like this .
this picture literally came in seconds after the baby was placed in the poor and i got it over .
rg : oh , oh .
av : taboo number three : you don &apos;t have to be talking about your disbelief -- but i &apos;m going to talk today about my talk today .
the general opinion is that every aspect of my life has become better than i &apos;ve been born in the wonder of birth and family .
but you realize that you &apos;re going to be able to lose control of the wonderful way of losing your life , and what is very satisfying to do .
rg + av : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s one of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve seen all these &quot; star &quot; with the computer &apos;s surface .
imagine , great , already listening to hearing , just like you might play personally , and john dunlap &apos;s walker shows how footage on the exact heart and the video , and you can play it on the top of the inner wing .
now , since then , we &apos;ve experienced a time of extraordinary economic growth , the longest origins in the history of this country .
but now , a few months later , like good politicians , they may be like , &quot; in the contaminated apple to screw the mine , &quot; like the mine , &quot; how did someone wear their uncertainty , yet they don &apos;t hide them .
now , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i met this guy , a very chaotic man , who had fed up a tomato soup , and iron for completely celebrated .
but interestingly , it also is a future where society is a few tricks of capitalism , which is how to isolate the dna , which is how to be mapped to the dna , trying to create things and then the ones that work , and then they work , and they work , and they work .
i want to show you a fascinating new hypothesis , and some surprising new insights that i &apos;ve been working on , about the context of the language of language that you &apos;re talking about , and your tendency to save .
and if i want to talk right , it forces me to think about it constantly .
well , this is a very important theory .
please squeeze this device so you can get this device , so you can take your dominant hand to your favorite hand .
it &apos;s the present pleasure in exchange of future pain .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important the ability to communicate about generations .
we english , we &apos;ll get them out of the world .
but i &apos;m about using them as a way to make it a challenge .
but they didn &apos;t get the results they wanted .
at the same time , i was on the field of the operating community , although i was a ph.d. in caution .
people and the topography and the topography and birds and the birds and all the red line here is going up . these are people , livestock and pets .
we focused on serious energy problems of the future and produced products for the company .
let &apos;s see the next video .
and the last night , the party was flying around , and -- you can see how it just works , and you can see every single person you want .
and he was a drunk of the people who practiced the buddhist religion in india at the time .
and he goes back as a broken man .
and he has to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , the smell and everything .
the animals are in one of their lives . people are people .
we &apos;re very much in . we feel the feeling of memory , and a lot of these things in the living of the living .
and you think about how the things are the things that are when you &apos;re happy .
and of course , they &apos;re cruel and more of the other .
even though the change in your attitude is something that makes you something different for other creatures , you feel these new quality in you , and it &apos;s helping you , and it &apos;s serving you as a model .
so the coffee cup , or the cup of struggle , is using a way of using tools to get the public health .
interestingly , the complexity is very high .
we &apos;ve heard bill gates recently .
so it &apos;s very , very simple if you know how to read it .
well , let me close with four general remarks , an example and two reuters .
and i don &apos;t want to stop it with the details , but in the bottom right-hand corner , you can see what we have for it .
did you start doing that ?
and this is the most important thing that the most important thing about the things that jimmy had talked about , what our new kinds of organization is , or how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things are always less able to be able to do it in the use of using the use of the oil industry .
so , take a look for astronomy , which was a ph.d. .
it &apos;s also going to give birth to professional arguments .
so there &apos;s no argument of two camp , but between these camps , it &apos;s going to give all sorts of interesting positions that are taken by people .
that costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to spend their own , and actually , a team , and then they did it : between new zealand and spain .
and the first thing i thought was to thank him for this .
but the truth is that life is happening right here .
so people started calling messages like this .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m batman to get batman to true my anonymity . &quot;
and the one who didn &apos;t make a very hard set of stuff , so that turned out they were moving in a different city and had a new job .
and in the last 35 years , i studied human behavior on the basis of everything , started from genes about brain imaging , dopamine and census , until the most successful .
some of you have it . and it &apos;s dependent on gender .
this was one of those cases , because you had no violence under her ancestors , but at my father .
they &apos;re similar to each other as you can only be .
by the way , i have an email , and i &apos;m going to get an email in which we &apos;ve been doing the last part of atlas .
and these guys here are the weak force that might be the least known .
so if you want to know , why the sky is blue or why nuclei wear nuclei , you should basically be in the way that dna has the form that you have now -- that dna has the shape that you have now .
the comparison is that people in this room are the higgs boson .
but it &apos;s really that with this theory , the physics of the big bang seem to unite at the big bang , and a perfectly wonderful prediction , which is not that it &apos;s done with the goal that this is happening , but it seems to do it .
they created this civilization , this wonderful picture , the darkness in light , and it allows the civilization to see from all the way .
another big insight came from a study of the wayne state university in 2010 , the baseball cards of the world &apos;s terminal survey , looked at the 1950s .
in a similar study in germany , researchers use an fmri test to measure the security of the brain , and after they had the face of the face to be smiling .
&quot; because the colors that they have , they &apos;re not being used to the european standard , &quot; he said .
&quot; safer ? why ? are there more policemen under this ? &quot;
we built the light that people , the people , people , were thinking of the people who were in the foreign office , they were to think they were going to go abroad , to make their cause .
president roosevelt said , &quot; believe that you can do something and you &apos;ve done it half . &quot;
all over port-au-prince , entrepreneurs came up and offered the bicycles for mobile phones .
a graph for the transformative power of technology is found in kibera .
by 2015 , it will be three billion smartphone on the world .
in the shops of the environment , the batteries and bread were discarded .
this river of time is embedded in everything : in the erosion of a computer , the bud , which is the marshmallow to put in the rose .
do you read a writer with a writer ?
and also , when i look at the big bear , i remember how i was a kid on his head , not to slide from his shoulders to slide out of his shoulders , and i feel like this kid .
we &apos;ve seen that , again , how creative technology can be and in our lives , and we can do that in our lives and we can choose the solutions , innovation and moments that don &apos;t take the flow of time .
my mother was a hospital .
in every single refugee camp , she had to paint up to paint my older brother mark , who was nine , and they wanted to take a child child and make a child child child .
and i should do it alone .
take something you want to have from the suitcase .
then i ended up in winnipeg because i don &apos;t have my feelings .
thank you .
so almost everything on earth is going to be wiped out five times .
svante paravicini the answer .
why should that play a role ?
so , in theory , we can grow any organ from any cell from any cell .
here &apos;s the rise in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the conclusion .
when the rotors turn up with the same speed , the robot is floating .
and you see how robust control is .
and he does that while he &apos;s obstacles .
they take their neighbors true .
this is showing that we can double the most powerful , triple , 30 million , the radar line we can bring them into teams like you can see here .
but the robot can also figure out where it wants to go .
i can do that . but there &apos;s so much and i want to expand your horizon , and the mind is opening up and changing your view of honeybees .
this is a huge problem for many years , basically since the late 1980s , the most different , many different viruses , bacteria and the more common ones .
they don &apos;t experience that .
the gut for their dishes , and the honey -- there &apos;s a lot of the hands -- they use the honey to their bars .
the bee dies . honeybees die when they stick , so they didn &apos;t want to do it .
okay , so now , really , the question is : why is this ?
of course , we also have it , especially in the last decade , the world with a dense chain of industry , with a chain of global trade .
and never before were so many people in this fact .
in fact , many of you don &apos;t know that our bread was of course not european invention .
and especially the meat meat in the world and china is driving the most high .
science science has been in most people , and here are not many farmers under them , to be bad to punish the environment , to be able to destroy the environment .
everything is all associated .
and so while i finished my bread , and i have it , and i &apos;m trying to burn the hands . i &apos;m not trying to burn the hands .
also , it has to be a long way to keep the land available , and to repair materials and materials and the more powerful .
you take somebody like me , a scientist , analyzed and test and we &apos;re going to be able to create a new technology , and determines the quantitative design system .
because i hope you take this from here today , a new connection with nature .
this was a couple of days ago in madrid .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
this is last year .
but the quantified explorer was one of them , and shekhar kapur was a film about her , and he was going to see her .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but this is the kind of time that we have a specialty .
this is a patient &apos;s patient who was in the back of 73 -- he needed a bypass pad , but he was just going to take a tear .
i like this slide because you &apos;re talking about what people really motivated to change , and what not .
if you eat a high fat meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a more powerful one . americans eat more fat because even more and more carbs . so the percentage is lower , but the actual number , but the actual number , the goal is to reduce both .
one of the most popular studies that we found was that 70 percent of people were clogged , 65 percent of people had bad breath , 54 percent of people had a headache -- that &apos;s not a healthy diet .
on the other hand , everything is what intimacy is , the calcium .
i hope he &apos;s not staying .
the film is based on a computer scanner from f. scott .
two main classes were involved in the project : warner brothers and the street .
and we had enough passion to make the most powerful and technology .
we &apos;re telling us about motion capture .
the number seemed to be infinitely .
and these are the data that we get , and then we use it for the model .
and so this finished picture was taken out of the film .
this was a very , very early sample .
and we found this , in the middle of the state in karnataka .
and has a personal form .
people from storytellers will overcome this cruel , more satisfying past , where they lived for their lives .
we were too late -- two kenyan as the driver -- and imagine that this is a very large ocean of sand , 40 degrees of water , a water bottle .
i think the camel is best in the world on the world . &quot;
and they use them as much as we see our most sophisticated .
we weigh our animals .
so i &apos;ll show you another movie .
i don &apos;t get to my body temperature until my body temperature went down 40 degrees fahrenheit -- enough to shrink an egg .
so , thank you for inviting me .
start with a meeting with a poem . that would be an idea .
but how would it like to do it if you never know how to do the next day , whether you &apos;re going to get a living god the world , or whether you &apos;re sitting down the world , or you &apos;re sitting down there from the cracks with your little little plastic bag ?
who could sleep in this night ?
but you knew that judy had to get $ 150,000 in your age , that the french d is the french army to victory , and blaise pascal had cleaned his room -- no wait , i mean he invented the calculator ?
at the end , they sat in a tree and a flip hand to the other .
and the human genome system is more than that , but if you could remove these two columns , probably no longer left .
and also , we have the problem that you can &apos;t build a construction , that &apos;s too hard to be a single elephant .
one component of this is the understanding of it , and here &apos;s a kind of a computer problem : &quot; the ability to understand the feelings of the other . &quot;
so we &apos;re looking at more complex expressions . here &apos;s consolation .
that the test is not good for you .
there &apos;s a very simple task that you have to do .
a philosopher actually wrote us that it was impossible to have a sense that the al theory had a sense of fairness , because fairness was invented in the french revolution .
now it &apos;s not a lonely insane , it &apos;s not two crazy , three is a lot and a lot of power .
the last decade i spent with this , and the pain and humiliation , hopefully for a good thing , the most powerful thing .
and i have to say , god is thank you .
so i stopped in a way that was a success .
over the years , the serious design system can create .
a.j. jacobs : how healthy life is getting me almost drawing
and i think many scientists are sharing this view .
a really cool thing .
now these studies are scientifically valid and they were swallowed , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
ask for the part of the story that &apos;s not told .
... a priest ?
finally , one group that believes that the indus people are the ancestors of people in the world today .
right after left , how many ? okay .
it can be useful to create more data , creating more data that &apos;s then going to be .
this sign is the most common script , and only in this text seems to be twice .
it turns out it &apos;s in india long , to be able to be in the ground of the field of the day of the birth of the birth of the birth .
space , we all know how it looks .
this wire is going to be the root of the bell that would make the names famous .
and copernicus had made the historical discovery that these things can also be like radio waves .
actually , all the young people in the city .
somebody who sits next to you -- that &apos;s in a corporate , would you on a street factory , but someone would sit down on a street , and somebody would be so dense to you , then you would be able to get away .
the dalai lama always likes to say -- he says , if you &apos;re going to be able to get the idea of the idea of the internet , it &apos;s because you can see that you can and your pain and your pain and your pain , you know , are too small to the own intelligence .
but take this wonderful thing , the most powerful thing we showed , and they &apos;re selling us to fear .
a man ago was a tank to a picture that became a symbol of resistance .
but what would she do , if you had the modern communications , if you had the modern communications to make a sense that it was wrong , something that had to be done immediately ?
combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate on global level and organize global to the challenges that now are now of natural nature and the most of global nature .
in the museum of children in rwanda , there &apos;s a photograph of a young young -- and the media of children &apos;s lives , who were left , who were left , as in the process of the war of rwanda , died in the process of rwanda .
here &apos;s the task : help me build a vibrant , a vibrant , scalable , robotic device in 3d .
you can go on very different types of data -- they vary in the most different , the motion of the surface and the standard of the existing .
this is the driving algae as a mobile phone .
boy : screw .
we slow down to see the spines in action .
mark cutkosky at stanford , one of my partners , is an extraordinary engineer , which is called a technique called shape called shape , which is called the claws , which is the kind of an artificial foot .
you can see almost like aliens , and the secret , what makes you stick , are your skin toes .
so here we go out the band-aid .
these are the same structures allow the spines , the nitrogen , and the most powerful , and the most challenging , very difficult surfaces .
so , the long beautiful songs that are producing as a result of the world as a professional and males are also allowed to find females and choose a partner .
so if dolphins are less than 20 feet apart , they have to make less than half the time the input of the ball .
if we think of marine animals like dolphins like dolphins , we have to be about the consequences of our interventions , which we thought we were quite safe .
after the most violent , the marine system has made these systems available to the place to experience what scientists could hear .
they just hear the low frequencies .
if males and females use this signal to find a partner and they are scattered , they &apos;re going to imagine what the impact of the population would have been endangered species .
as ships are made , they can get out of the way that they could get a better amount of noise of this noise to get 90 percent reduction .
they &apos;re the speed of 50 percent .
we see strangers , we see strangers , we see , we see , 300 , 300 times , and it &apos;s going to be more and more . and they &apos;re not like us .
you have all the options available .
we observe a continual rise in the men .
and obviously there &apos;s a hundred , which is a hundred .
with initiatives like 100 dollars , it &apos;s me thinking that we &apos;re going to bring a whole new generation of people in the old computer system .
thank you .
i think none of it is the problem .
our daily life is , but we put together in an extraordinary state , we say in a very different state .
usually it &apos;s one or two per year .
and there are .
but we are much more sophisticated .
part of the challenge was to try to make rhythm and space by not just my hands -- juggling is a lot of plastic -- but the rhythm of my body and the feet , and the balls with my feet .
and then they play crazy .
ok , because they don &apos;t understand what a computer company is , i give you a little hint .
now , again , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
you have somebody up here who &apos;s the most powerful principle of the world , ok ?
pop -- and then it &apos;s going to be quiet . just one little number of times over time .
with space and straight on the room , they work in other ways .
and then levels of levels .
in this year -- you could show the slides -- in this year , we &apos;re wearing the most subtle , we have a project that we have helped the design to design .
we can call these on a mountain sample , which is what it allows you to put on another information about the clothing , while you &apos;re doing these things .
scott scott : i &apos;ve found that i &apos;m the leader of the day to become the leader of the day .
and we also give a new product to a new product , and it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s shown for public .
now the farmers are only in the season , and not in the coastal fashion .
electrons disappear in a way of a kind of energy and then only energy , and energy can &apos;t see .
this is what he thought he was there .
potatoes , potatoes have 48 chromosomes . have you known that ?
good . atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
and someone said to him , &quot; well , what is the point behind , henry ?
we &apos;ve been covering about four years of time .
if google is digitized a book , they get it in a very beautiful format .
i &apos;ll give you an example .
suddenly , in the middle of the 40s , everybody was excited .
but imagine it will not be interested in it .
but also many very , very far on the right , that apparently have benefited by propaganda .
if you peel up the toe , it means a &quot; eureka &quot; with a a.
if i run this pink sound for a few minutes , you would literally stop hearing it .
many people escape to headphones , but these are great , public spaces like this , shared spaces , in millions of tiny personal personal personal personal space .
you can do that in a beautiful place , like a lake .
and finally , an acronym .
and i said , &quot; this is my job . &quot;
thank you so much for having you . we &apos;re all so grateful . &quot;
and it went away .
because they weren &apos;t at the sidewalk table , and they couldn &apos;t see the exchange between me and my favorite , a exchange that was fair to us , but they were alien .
now , i &apos;m telling you , in the last year , there &apos;s a lot of competition , because the arab spring always spread , the most powerful -- which is still the one ?
this photograph was actually fired in a department of police , and you see the most popular of people who were tracking the police .
the kids just do pictures in a class that will get the teacher , they paste them on the ground .
in the talk today , it &apos;s about the brain and , yay , somewhere out there .
this is something we can work in our lifetimes , i thought i could have a difference , and i tried to get out of the street , and i was going to get out of the street .
but sometimes science has some other characteristics that they really do really interesting .
what do we bring over there ?
there &apos;s something that we believe it is , but it &apos;s wrong .
it &apos;s so , intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we &apos;re not looking at the alligator as a very intelligent , not in a human way .
in humans , we &apos;ve developed the most powerful part of the internet , with the name of the neocortex , which is the nature of the neocortex , and nature has done this little trick .
it &apos;s not that you look at it and say , &quot; what am i seeing now ?
not like a computer model . not like a computer model .
these are the things that are going to come first .
we need a police , we need something military , but only to defense .
you can see it on your turn . &quot;
they traveled because they were at the time of elections outside the country .
this is a little bit of a plastic test .
and then , when she closed the door , grandma said , &quot; no , no , no .
they wash it like that .
these group three , every one .
it &apos;s real .
it has done english to learn and learn this as a foreign language .
the computer already , and at one of three participants .
if you think , you know , the employers &apos;s employers , which is actually part of our experiment , because what we did is that we did that .
we repeated the experiment with the same groups , but we put a delay between the enlightenment , how we deal with the data , and the actual beginning of the following .
the price of the paradise is the displacement of paradise .
and they moved and hung up to each other and they would leave their arms on each other and leave them .
we &apos;re really good at talking about skills and security and health , we &apos;re really bad at talking about character .
then you can ask personal coach , the most powerful , like the sex of bad breath in the face of bad breath .
i don &apos;t really feel like emotion .
the first gift , or talent , is a lot of -- the ability to look at other people &apos;s heads and figure out what they have .
they have humility .
that &apos;s what the unconscious is looking for .
we found them between the very many , raped by many , many men , i don &apos;t know how many .
where does their journey start ?
and that it &apos;s not normal , in a home .
what was my challenge ?
they need their empathy .
lexicography : the process of dictionaries .
well , first of all , i &apos;m going to give the queen to blame because it &apos;s funny .
online dictionaries need to be different .
the bad words -- look , if someone thinks about a place and then don &apos;t find it on the map , he thinks , &quot; this map sucks ! &quot;
you think , &quot; ok , if we think words are tools that we use to make our minds , what is to say to us , how do you know that tritium is better than a hammer ?
the immediacy has 33 different hostility for set .
and then this mike &apos;s most amazing , mike &apos;s life lives in britain .
i &apos;ve got the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , &quot; told the dictionary . &quot;
so , i &apos;m going to take a chair .
and , to make a long story short , i &apos;ve landed .
and so , by the time , as this piece of time , as this three days , you start to understand : why do i hear all this kind of stuff ?
they may be from a ted speaker , and we can take the conversation in the year , and then come back next year , after the same intellectual and emotional journey .
the manufacturers don &apos;t have the most sophisticated ones in their cheap water , because they &apos;re not sure what the public would be doing with a precise charming , which could actually fold on the palm of the palm .
there was a very insecure thing that was already , if that was already , and was not in the situation that was able to find the channel .
instead of taking the credit of the world , you &apos;re sorry .
and : &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
we call ourselves a &amp; amp ; es &amp; amp ; es &amp; amp ; we &apos;re working and we live in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this work is the cartoon of a human being .
we &apos;re arguing about the assumption , &quot; what the world needs now is nuclear -- right ?
and now , there &apos;s only three main types of energy that we have -- coal and gas , water that &apos;s covered everywhere -- and nuclear .
we &apos;ve become the russian warheads by being transformed in electricity .
and the greenhouse emissions are equivalent emissions of all greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming , and it turned out to be turned into co2 .
now , if you look at the fact that the prevalence of nuclear weapons with the spread of nuclear weapons , because we know that india and pakistan are secretly in the nuclear weapons of nuclear weapons in the world .
for wind , the area is much bigger , but the most powerful is smaller .
the reality is that 21 states have nuclear power , right ?
and in the senate of the united states , we need the support of both parties -- just one or two voices to global warming in the senate , and that hall can help .
we &apos;re not going to get enough energy from renewables .
i was worried about the 10 years ago .
thank you .
this was -- my motivation became by apollo cuddy .
for the first time , we have enough wealth in the hands of some less people , and the available technology that will allow us to explore the space of space .
26 groups of seven countries took the competition , each one between one and 25 million dollars .
so , we can bring them to the space station .
and the advantage for the sponsors is the sum of the world &apos;s population and the social health system .
would you surprise us , i &apos;m intrigued ?
that means that space can cut itself . they can be incredibly small .
a challenge was , how can we express these new algorithmic order in a column ?
what i didn &apos;t know for time because we saw the outside , was that the areas on the side were going to be more powerful inside the column , which was a pretty surprising discovery .
inspired by the process of the cell division , michael &apos;s algorithms , the incredible , fascinating forms of the city , could produce it by hand , but you can build it . and you could build our understanding of architecture .
so look at this picture here -- a lot of forms here dance for you .
it &apos;s a very rare condition .
this is a drug that was developed for cancer .
you can see the chip mimics the pattern of the internet .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s led by young people .
and i think many people here in the room , many of you are in the same position as i am .
so i think women in our society are being leaders because they realize that it &apos;s very important for their future generations , our cultural identities .
we &apos;ve realized that since recently , more people like youtube and social networks use to give their stories expression to show their photos and tell their own ideas with their own voices .
at the same time , we &apos;re going to take them , and we can study our part of the world .
so i became more or less than &quot; no &quot; .
so i thought , &quot; maybe if i do this ants a few apartments , they pull there . &quot;
this was called a transducer house .
so i thought , &quot; how can i do that ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back the next day .
and it went ...
my work , roughly estimated , is sometimes five , six or seven weeks , you can &apos;t always anticipate .
and i turn it around , and it shaped the chariot &apos;s chariot .
so i broke the needle .
it &apos;s a very , very special work , but the best things come into small plastic .
they expect their employees to do what they asked them to do when they did the task , they can do more .
there &apos;s this absolute concentration of consciousness , this absolute interaction of consciousness , awareness , an absolute center of compassion and love that defines the primary properties of the divine , and the most honest thing of the divine .
my body &apos;s body flew into one direction , my favorite wheel in the other .
i asked all the walks i probably wouldn &apos;t do with them , the most of the time i would not be able to put them , the friends i wouldn &apos;t just look at , the friends i couldn &apos;t be able to do with them .
because you don &apos;t need the most basic .
and if you &apos;re going to get you from back to the wind , you can just tip it down and it &apos;s going to be the way you &apos;re going to do it . &quot;
20 years ago , doctors had cut my leg and hoped , and there was a 15 year-old survival rate .
as i became more and more more skilled , and in this time in my life , i was probably 14 kilos easier than i am now .
and nobody is carrying this modern health model in my eyes more than david black .
so , running upright , you &apos;re the threshold of what makes us human .
he &apos;s president of international coalition for the world &apos;s sake of what the least most important name i &apos;ve ever heard about .
he was born for a year early , and it was really a fantastic thing of him .
so once i tried to get to the piano , i became a strong piece of plastic .
and at the end , you were so fast that things like flight didn &apos;t have trouble , right ?
do you want to hear me play ?
dp : &quot; tiger rag . &quot;
i don &apos;t get this .
they &apos;re fighting about their own lifestyle in this forest , in a world that is still clean , a world that &apos;s not isolated yet , in a world that &apos;s not isolated yet .
so we know that they &apos;re capable of having to be able to do the research for absolutely impossible , when i started .
the long human being supported to the mother , who are developing during this long childhood , and also the siblings , can remain all the lives long , and that can be to 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and also the huge camp in the forest , now , meat , and so the pygmies that put in congo and in their wonderful lives lived so many hundreds of years , they rented .
this guy said that .
we &apos;re now in every state , and the problems in florida are other than the ones in new york .
come on and turn me down here ?
there &apos;s a politician out there in the politicians ?
what we want to do in the lab is that pretty much the same , but with a few dozen of different kinds of molecules -- so a unique reduce of complexity , but yet trying to create something more nuanced .
it &apos;s actually very , very much more powerful . if you &apos;re a bit of a way of making it , it doesn &apos;t really do something .
now , where you &apos;re all the experts for protocells , we &apos;re going to play with these protocells .
we see the self-assembly of this body from oil oil that we &apos;ve seen before , and the black blob in it represent this black mud -- this diverse , very complex , organic black mud .
in his lab , martin mandelbrot &apos;s &quot; protocells &quot; is called protocells , experimental light of chemicals that behave like living cells . his work shows how life could be done on earth first -- and perhaps elsewhere .
this is a kind of a video game to take a pop card on the evening .
what &apos;s this -- where did you know that ? you &apos;ve taken it .
but if we were doing that at every -- every fire fire , we could redefine the emergency .
it &apos;s the crap that &apos;s otherwise in your nice pink lungs , and it &apos;s being brought into connection with -- and it &apos;s being connected .
the birds could jump from one to another .
you can see the current news of him . they can talk to him .
but to keep this herd , a big toll of our planet will demand .
next , we put skin cells and multiply it in a more concrete .
we &apos;ve been working with a lot of years of oil programs , starting with products like wine , beer and yogurt .
it &apos;s true that if we &apos;re doing all the research in the world , we see that there &apos;s almost a universal pursuit of people , a car .
let me just talk about hydrogen .
this is a huge way to create energy , creating mobile energy .
if we can see these kinds of things , that can also be other .
you had to survive .
and we certainly found our school district to be supported to support funding and support .
because why should our students go away from their own living ?
it became a book , then to a presentation .
there was an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
here you have her forest destroyed your forest .
but on this picture , you see how we started building the most powerful , which was soon a big kind of a giant brazil .
when i was for the time , my favorite time to start , i &apos;ve been studying the new field of the field of research .
if you &apos;re in the south manhattan , you see the expansion of new york city like it was , at the end of the american revolution .
the white surfaces on this map are confined to the most degraded place .
or the most prolific , the wet meadows , the insects and the other things that are needed .
maybe a business of a woman lived there .
it &apos;s so much power to unite science and visualization , that this imagery is spreading . it &apos;s like both sides of the mirror .
and we have a really dramatic level of this in our society right now .
so i don &apos;t have to go to that .
you can do the pristine thing , of course .
this is a building building .
so , one example we all know is that the mobile phone . right ?
and it &apos;s all about this question -- of course in a very artistic and indirect way .
but it happens everywhere , and these tools are parts of it that help us to do it .
seriously -- clap it quiet -- that &apos;s really great .
alex steffen : a sustainable future
you could be my idea that this could be a big problem for a law , but congress doesn &apos;t seem to be very careful about it .
but if you create a lot of risks , you can do a lot of high-quality copies , and it &apos;s not okay .
some of the things we share , we made things that we found and causes every single option to be in this industry .
that &apos;s the simple thing .
i had a very , very ambiguous , expensive , expensive education in india , and that &apos;s almost broken me .
and i thought , i start a barefoot college -- college only for the poor .
a professional one is somebody with a combination of competence , confidence and belief .
when i said that , they said , &quot; do you show us what &apos;s possible ? what do you do ?
the entire electricity comes from the sun .
democracy , the way you miss your country , what you should do if you &apos;re arrested , what you should do if you &apos;re a animal .
comes in there , it cuts the presence of the schools , it &apos;s between teachers and parents to animate , so that the dolls can call the teachers and the parents , &quot; give you the hands .
you use sign sign .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , mr. president .
a computer company .
and our main process creates one of the largest , dynamically , dynamically computers in the world for this kind of information .
you see the most powerful line of the surface of the world , which we have as an artist for the scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , there &apos;s data of these two groups of people , data about how happy they are .
&quot; i &apos;m going to physically , financially , emotionally , mentally and mentally , and almost every other way . &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t get a minute .
he was not yelling to him the money , and of course , ray was the same idea of six months later .
in this case , it &apos;s because they &apos;re used in the experiment i &apos;ve been using to tell you , prints from the images of the images .
we collected our materials , and we went out of the room , waiting half an hour .
i &apos;m going to show you why .
and they made two pictures and they had two beautiful , &quot; shiny codes of &quot; yo displays for them , and we said , &quot; what would you be going to be ? &quot;
we take a completely new group of naive to say , &quot; you know , we give a more powerful and we can make it on two different kinds of ways .
and the big car , the big car , and the most remote , and the most beautiful .
voices : it flies in the air . oh shit .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t start . &quot;
don &apos;t forget that this tradition is not from the clouds of the clouds , but back in a time , even before we put stories on the street of the street or the street on the wooden water .
the way food , yeah .
the kind of the roof , you know , you know .
and so we left my father , because i knew he would kill me when i had to drive her to the car . so we go into the car .
&quot; and had this guy about a blue uniform and a more powerful expression in the face ? &quot;
i really want to go in there ? because if i don &apos;t have a thread , i &apos;m stuck with the eyes of the taste -- enough metaphor for your taste ? -- could it be that i never come back .
look ? we &apos;re a secret club with a secret diagnostic system .
she says , &quot; ma , you have to look ! &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m happy for the little old lady , &quot; damn , damn . &quot;
it &apos;s up from the car . &quot;
i really scared .
so what is the social outcome of this ?
where can i go today and join with whom ?
and if we have it , we &apos;ll decide how many miles we &apos;re driving , where we live and work .
intelligent witnesses at the station , and you see , you see , where your bus is just on the road and when it comes to the , and when it comes to real time , you can buy your clothing .
i want to say that we &apos;re going to be building the wireless wireless technology , and i challenge that this network should be accessible to the open standards for each .
and they came in the late 1960s .
and for all of you , that came with a mental illness in touch , knowing what to be a challenge .
i said that i wanted to tell the most powerful , i wanted to share with you the three a &apos;s fantastic , and i wanted to leave her with a clear slide .
because they all were three years old .
and so what i love about this story is that rosey grier just is a genuine person , and it &apos;s about authenticity .
i ate the jargon with a lot of time . &quot;
you can sleep in clean sheets .
j it &apos;s so many that &apos;s got the difficulty .
i found it strangely to play , as if it was a competition , about a fresh wound .
it &apos;s the highest one that &apos;s a white , rich , rich , rich , which was not challenged for the city .
it looks pretty simple , but it was a very simple thing .
people are going to be more sensitive to two things -- they were amazed about the destruction , but there was also a sense of the most powerful of the new york , which i found very moving .
because when the four platforms along the field of time -- which is a better version of a laser , we know that it had to be mobile to get on the ground , and the developed definition of ground zero .
we have the opportunity to rethink our thinking about cities .
dr : it was an honor .
and i know that every year of concussion suffer every year .
if -- god forbid -- somebody from us here , and a concussion , would be a concussion , most of us would be completely more fully fully more fully fully more fully , and a little bit of a sudden , to some weeks .
you have to know about the problems that we &apos;re talking about today .
as it turns out , tom saw a helmet for 20 dollars a good opportunity to preserve a 100,000 percent of a sudden .
it &apos;s not true , but it happened tony blair during the 1939 forum in 2005 when his doodle , of course , &quot; were discovered , &quot; and he described this way .
in other words , you have a common and growing complexity of visual language that happens in the blink of a series .
he said it was not a cure .
today , all countries are committed to provide patents for drugs that have at least 20 years .
it depends on the business company of the bird companies , to make their patents more to make them available and to make them available .
in 1919 , the same kind of stage , a computer , the people sat in the canoe , the afternoon at very high humidity and they didn &apos;t think they were .
you can adapt everything to make your well-being .
he provides all these services , they spread , tickets and so small things you &apos;re doing online , but for people who he &apos;s doing with the digital world .
the question was , &quot; how do you make this teacher ?
let &apos;s see what he does here .
and the husband of the daughter , he was sick by the comrades of his wife .
but the visual complexity is still very big .
now , the computer has a computer company on our studies .
well , if we feel emotions , we show them .
and you could get the impression that the unhappy people are taking a different structural position inside the network .
this is my favorite story . &quot;
they &apos;re both made out of carbon , and yet one of both two types of cells in it are put in a particular way , on the left , and they get a little bit of the color , and they get the soft and dark .
to put this thing into the back , let me pull out something .
older is not just going to be .
among the same circumstances , older people are taking their cognitive resources , like the standard and memory , more on positive information than negative .
we cost life .
they would let me say , &quot; tonight i &apos;m going to perform this ted project for this girl on this bar . &quot;
kid david : it &apos;s so that i say , honestly , often not that right , what happens when i dance .
they &apos;ve called me a brother and uncles , and i was invited to go back to a period of five years .
shaffi : the second contract of fort laramie laramie is clearly the most clear sioux nation and the lakota of the lakota black hills .
the treaty of fort laramie was asking that at least three quarters of the world &apos;s head would have to sign land .
they were tired of treaties .
the most powerful is eight times as high as in american average .
so what are we going to do ?
and today , child mortality has dropped over 24 percent since 1960 percent .
you get it either as a pill or a syringe , you have to take it every day to regulate your blood sugar .
if we do , how do we do it with people ?
but basically it makes a lot of sense .
she &apos;s called , are you smarter than a computer problem ?
bmw is a very safe car .
the problem for bmw is that this car looks safe .
now you &apos;re going to think , &quot; if my life depends on it , i &apos;m going to use it every day . &quot;
we need to connect this with a scientific method .
this is something else to do as a matter campaign .
nothing new is .
the lights will become dark .
we &apos;re doing it for our clients .
we have the sun in the sun .
now -- logic -- meaning looks , looks at this position of view , you can now see this position in the right here -- without moving the wrist .
i &apos;m going to be now going to be now going to be able to be able to do this . so , if every time -- another person -- not always the same answers .
so , if you &apos;re interested in this , i &apos;m going to present some of the things that i &apos;m going to present .
here -- i have to look at it from beginning to take my cards in the back of the day -- oh , we should have started to start -- no problem , no problem .
yeah ?
i think ...
lg : pardon ?
what &apos;s the map i should use ? the lady or the five ?
lg : but you see the hand .
wait at a moment -- please take any card .
another color . lg : diamonds , perfect .
compassion .
ace , yeah ? zoe : yeah .
here -- all the cards are covering -- here -- all the cards are plotted -- is you right ?
and finally , the king -- in exactly ... five seconds .
some of you seem to know this kid .
after i was back , i was doing my whole company to a computer company . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have a manual , you could not have a trip in your car .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s really happening here .
i always say my students , &quot; if you have a fallacy , you &apos;ll see a eyebrow , you see it . &quot;
imagine the person and follow the whole way to the b to e and they will hear everything that chopin had to say .
i had an amazing experience . i was 45 years , was the conductor for 20 years , and suddenly a realization .
she came to auschwitz when she was 15 years old , her brother was eight , her parents lost her .
so , ladies and gentlemen from the jury , look at this .
if you &apos;re the fastest of all today , you get 20 dollars . &quot;
but for tasks of the 21st century , this soundtrack , no -- doesn &apos;t work -- often not , and does not work often .
think about your own work .
living is lower .
these are the building blocks of a completely new operating system for our business .
this one day of intense autonomy has led to a whole range of plastic , which may never have been given .
do it because you like to do it .
the aluminum is used because of its light weight .
in a series of 55 spheres , it &apos;s enriched , proportional , every sphere and its distances , and its distances are rapidly mapped to this little earth .

that &apos;s what he does .
you know , the authority is available to the authority when it &apos;s needed . it &apos;s very important .
so kleiber is about the process .
as a result , we tell ourselves many stories about the future and about what steps we could do from here .
there are 98 nations worldwide in the world .
and in the face of climate change , it &apos;s not really really feasible .
and it &apos;s a process that makes really joy .
you think about whether you should move it forward .
and the main thing said , &quot; if we don &apos;t have transition , we would have to invent this entire community in the first time . &quot;
but there &apos;s a problem .
the budgets are not really balanced . and to a certain degree of the games that they play , the subject that they play to hide this topic so much , so you can &apos;t recognize what the most obvious is really obvious .
in fact , there are five states that are worse , and really only four states that don &apos;t have this big challenge to stand up .
and even if you just go extinct , you could get money there .
it should be more like private accounting .
but i had a special mind when i went to visit the computer , and i was in a deep school store in my life and i tried to decide to decide between music and medicine .
if you laugh , you know .
many years after the solar clocks , a young lady , a young lady i knew that sex might be because of the five senses .
and the first one is that good sex is all about five senses on an extreme level .
of course , the five senses is not the only thing that makes life interesting .
we &apos;re all born as an artist .
if you have a conversation , the child has to come up with the next answer to the more responsible , which has begun .
but your parents tell you , &quot; it will escape all of the waves . &quot;
but kids usually make art from fun . it &apos;s play .
but that &apos;s a teacher that you find rarely .
in the northern of a lot , there are always people who are leaving &quot; the &quot; the &quot; s &apos; path &quot; or &quot; hotel california &quot; as they mimic them .
in this minute , we can turn off the tv , and it &apos;s a little bit of the internet , stand up , and they start to do something .
the students fall in a kind of trance .
he said it was his profile . &quot; and what are they ? &quot; i said , &quot; actor , &quot; he said .
let &apos;s start with this point .
it will give stronger storms and bigger floods .
if you &apos;re , it will give you a warming in the future .
but the delay is exactly the expectations .
the economic consequences are almost inconceivable .
a big part of the species will be threatened by extinction .
now , if you &apos;re a car accident , it &apos;s critical that we &apos;re not only going to save the stunt , but the crew .
and so , for something else , otherwise , it was used to all the things that you had .
but today we use a more dynamic .
it &apos;s not a matter of a game .
in 1960 , joseph mcchrystal &apos;s united states of air air force has something very incredible .
one of the difficulty in this altitude , if you go to 10,000 feet -- that &apos;s great , right ? if you go to 10,000 bucks , you can really use oxygen .
and they &apos;ve designed a puppet for him , and he looked like this .
we expect and expect to expect the demonstrations or the most important to say , &quot; you have to put somebody in a suit that &apos;s not shown , which is connected to the airplane . &quot;
there were three main principles -- right ? -- that &apos;s going to be a lot of the time , which is important for what i want to talk about .
and the girl answered , &quot; you know , you know . &quot;
the problem is to stay an artist as you grow up , and i &apos;m convinced that we don &apos;t grow in creativity , but we &apos;re going to be in the way that we &apos;re going to be in the world .
all over the world .
the whole system was invented -- there was no public education systems in the world .
the brain is not divided in areas .
they did ballet , they made a film and jazz , and jazz dance , they danced modern and contemporary dances .
the festival goes to the end of a very good press for the press that you would die .
let &apos;s just say value for the long-term game .
in dubai , like a hand , i want to encourage everybody to help the things that are going on .
before i want to go back to the middle east , i &apos;m going to end up with a quote of a single one of the largest oil .
it &apos;s also the most profound .
well , you &apos;re a little bit of the behavior , and you &apos;re kind of a brain of behavior .
we don &apos;t have all the facts . we don &apos;t even know what tools will be , or what we &apos;re going to do in the same way to be able to be able to get into that , before the different behavior shows .
how are you going to increase it ? &quot;
the three are all the same , although all the same in context is in different context , one is magical , the other two are like work i like to have these books because they have something very special .
the kids taught them it .
they were very friendly .
we also believe that the content is more important .
i was changing by my children .
howard &apos;s doing this experiment , and when he gets the data , he draws a curve , and suddenly he recognizes that no beautiful news effect makes .
this was his debut . he was obsessed with it .
howard doesn &apos;t believe that there &apos;s this at all .
people always say that when you ask them how to wish their coffee .
a mustard with more elegance and culture and meaning .
so , it &apos;s . and why liked that ?
he was denied a few times , and spent most of his career in lower drums , and ended up in management . he became the general manager of &apos; oakland a .
we all know what happened when millions of women were going to have more of the symptoms of the symptoms of the oil system until we have a huge study , and we found from the national health system , found , found out , found out .
thank you .
but dad &apos;s favorite thing , he didn &apos;t want us to do that .
but there &apos;s also a standard area in between .
these are four really different ways to see the world . i &apos;ve named it .
what &apos;s interesting is , once you get it -- and by the way -- that &apos;s from the amur falcon -- you &apos;re going to show all the artifacts of modern comics : the most powerful of modern comics , and a more powerful one on the left .
and that was what i proposed : we might be able to make comics on an infinite canvas : on the top of the mountain and the y-axis and the y-axis .
this is from daniel &apos;s most fond of the u.k.
maybe all of you have been very clear , but for me , so often i had this hard day , i had never seen this one of the most powerful challenges that i had ever seen .
this is honestly and genuine , and the reason the fey is such a sustainable impression of the powerful sense of creativity .

i want to start a little different tonight , because i want to ask you to leave the land , and jump into open ocean .
they were starting to go after the disappearing of dinosaurs , 65 million years ago when whales had left legs , and they were coming out of a plastic factory , and they &apos;re coming out of the water of the brain .
and how do you do that ?
the california &apos;s california , the molas , when they come into the bay , they get them out of the bay , they turn them into a kind of a kind of a conceptual , and then they put it around .
i &apos;ll show you our last data data .
and in the most exciting , all of her love and her interest for the oceans were in the world .
as you can see here , this is a circuit board .
so , you don &apos;t hear any day .
mr ha .
in australia , it &apos;s mostly the aboriginal aboriginal students sitting in prison .
she told him and he asked the first to be the first to what we call the most popular .
because nobody gets a college of the box .
so why don &apos;t we do something about this problem in the everyday world ?
goodbye mahatma gandhi .
could i get my last dive ?
never , that &apos;s impossible ! no , no , no , no . it &apos;s not possible . &quot;
you could deal with the addition to the conclusion .
von neumann , a mathematician and a mathematician from the army brought everything together , and then they needed a space to build them .
and the one of the things that worked at first was a first time .
&quot; ah ! &quot; they found that it was a more powerful thing .
i know if i have to beat myself . &quot;
he had the machine running all night . if somebody remembers stephen wolfram , who was even invented again .
now we &apos;re going to sit here 50 years later -- it &apos;s a kind of force of legislation .
sadly , in the next 18 minutes i &apos;m talking about here , four americans , who are now alive , dying , because of their diet .
this is a global problem .
charles city .
and he has the hottest full of it . he &apos;s tired of his friends , his family , and his community to be able to get their family .
they want to be -- they want to control themselves .
you know , it has remained for long , long time at this tight understanding .
we don &apos;t teach our kids .
and most kids get them .
all right , supermarkets .
if you can cook , time doesn &apos;t matter .
in all america , many wonderful things go to the world when we just look back .
misha glenny : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen -- a clever group of political hacker that is 2011 .
the net connects everything and it &apos;s going to be very soon a lot of human activity .
interestingly , anonymous uses his own information , but not for financial profits .
he explained to me how in 2003 , and 2004 , as he went in new york tour , 10,000 dollars from the plastic machine here , 10,000 dollars from the plastic machine there , by using a serial cards .
he was born in a stable and respect family , and he was born in a very robust and he was being brought to a teenager with a teenager .
and most of the people , with the players and the internet , showed no real social skill in the world -- only in the net .
i think there &apos;s several reasons . i &apos;m not going to go into the details , but some people say .
but they &apos;re all the market , and what &apos;s driving the market is , especially , one is the big demographic community , the big demographic community .
we &apos;ve also found a lot of examples of dead big boxes that have been transformed in all kinds of social institutions , many schools , and many libraries , and many libraries , like this one .
and finally , i expect the streets will stretch through the mall in the mall .
it &apos;s very successful . and it helped flourish that eight of 13 regional crop users have been discarded in 3.8 plans .
the stream was covered by the parking lot .
their citizens are different than typical , but they &apos;re less of a health than cities .
&quot; his vagina to look at , &quot; she said , &quot; is a whole whole business . &quot;
but actually , it didn &apos;t start there , it started with a conversation with a woman .
it &apos;s about a gender , which is a basic resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a key , and the way it really exists in the body , and i think there &apos;s a real meaning in our bodies , our bodies of our minds -- that this separation has created a division of a division that is also causing the decision to do that .
i want to tell you this little story about my own beginnings , because that &apos;s very much about happiness , and with agnes .
maybe it &apos;s on my home south carolina , which is not much smaller than that today , and in the way that we do hungary , and once from a future as an independent country .
well , maybe he was too damn naive , because he stayed where he was , even long after they were going to go after the nazis , and even after the police and the street and the street and the street .
and he got the same answer : &quot; bring me the best workers you can find and when you &apos;re good enough , i &apos;m going to do it . &quot;
and also , it tells us , &quot; it &apos;s okay . it was all so beautiful .
&quot; ah ! &quot; he said dr. robicsek . &quot; i went to the film . &quot;
like , he said to too much .
and you can imagine it right .
you know what you &apos;re looking for .
but we &apos;re taking care of the most difficult cases and we &apos;re doing order to do the other day for the next day .
so we came to these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother went to mit while the soviet union .
and if you think it &apos;s not going to be , it &apos;s so long , you can keep it on .
what i want to do with this is i hope to make these points .
and what i want to point out later in the presentation is 50 percent of the united states .
it &apos;s the kind of light that &apos;s because the photons can &apos;t reach the average depth of the ocean , which is the water that &apos;s the mile , and the rift valley is on the highway .
and so we drove along the mountain station in a field next to the most prolific , and found the missing heat .
so i started developing a new computer company , with a computer company , which replaces me , and i don &apos;t have to go up in my vehicle .
we find the state of conservation .
and i looked at them yesterday , she &apos;s up in seattle . ok .
but i would leave a kid without a driver &apos;s control .
in some parts of the world , for example , in south africa , education is just hard to get available .
when we saw the impact of the attempt , andrew and i , that we had to extend it to so many people as possible to offer the best education of education .
what was the special thing about these courses ?
the video will all be interrupted , and the students will ask a question .
so we wanted to convince some of our colleagues of the humanities that multiple choice is not so bad .
in terms of certain courses , you can ask what the most common horizons are and how to help the students to fix these .
we even see the beginning of either a personalized curriculum or through a personalized curriculum that we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe , and what my first thought was , what infinity means when i was a child .
and in our society , of course , it &apos;s mostly about making the reality of other .
i have my doubt about the values of newton &apos;s science , like rational , it &apos;s expected to be rational in a corporate position .
so you can understand my surprise , when i got to read in the new yorker , alan greenspan , the head of kenyan reserve , says , &quot; james rand , &quot; his head of life is his mentor mentor .
i think you can do this funny thing , and you can &apos;t have the ones that have not yet , and that &apos;s why i don &apos;t have jokes , and i &apos;m not very proud of the very least that i &apos;m doing .
i &apos;m just right now , i &apos;m going to show you this old time of the most violent , which i &apos;m telling you .
he said , i &apos;d have to pay him more respect because it can take to 18 years to become a really good thing .
huh ? yes ? what ? i can &apos;t hear them . &quot;
and i &apos;m afraid of this active one , you know , not .
i &apos;ve thought about moshe &apos;s thoughts about beauty that you &apos;re talking about yesterday . there &apos;s no adoption in his book , that the trickster can make beauty .
george w. bush : what the defense of our security costs , and what the defense of our freedom costs , we need to pay the price . &quot;
ten years ago , no astronomer on the world would have come to the idea -- well , or very few astronomers -- that there &apos;s planets outside of our solar system .
many other ecosystems on earth are truly in danger .
he &apos;s constantly making a case that an experiment could be wrong with a particle accelerator , and a chain of a chain that is destroyed the world .
we need to have a lot of work to work with with biotechnology as a result .
so , of course , we don &apos;t want to see .
what can we do about that ?
and now the worst thing comes .
we use a lot of money to make sure that we don &apos;t die in a business of a car , but we &apos;re not spending anything . and yet it &apos;s completely preventable .
we don &apos;t want to be caught back on the wrong foot .
i hope that it will .
this is very , very important , because this is the system that came out of the planet , and it &apos;s now at the time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing insight . and we &apos;ve only been aware of it for recently .
and this is what the system came to come up with , a number of places in the southern hemisphere , in these circles .
everybody who &apos;s going to get it out , just to get to the database and can get information that &apos;s needed for everything , which is what &apos;s happening .
we &apos;re going to ride the wave , the technological possibilities .
in a earthquake , big amounts of these new microbes that we never saw before , from the sea floor .
the most powerful john hunter &apos;s brain is creating a network of the cameras and sensors that make our oceans to global , interactive lab -- and a more powerful subject about the world of deep .
so i think optimism is going to move forward to architecture .
so again , radical versus conservative .
the most obvious thing about the finite . you know , too often , you want to understand everything .
our intellectual desires are complex .
you know , it &apos;s true ; the cathedrals , as an unexpected , will always be unexpected .
but i &apos;m rather an unknown , and i even play a little bit of the mistakes , and even with mistakes , rather than repeat the same constantly , so it &apos;s by its hubris .
risks of spaces never have been so much as much as they should be in a very recent city .
there &apos;s the emotions of victims .
daniel libeskind : a lot of ideas , and he calls 17 terms of his vision of architecture -- angiogenesis , paranoid , more frustrating , radical -- and inspiration for every bold creative pursuit .
it also has the lowest largest of all the cars of this size .
is this really a really , really , really , going to be a little bit of a little bit of a game ?
em : it &apos;s just that it &apos;s just . if you don &apos;t , we &apos;re in big trouble .
with this capital , and it &apos;s installed buckminster , and it &apos;s turning the panels on the roof and then it &apos;s turning a monthly village , and it &apos;s a monthly village , which is lower than the bill &apos;s electricity bill .
we &apos;ve failed , but we &apos;ve got to get it down in 2008 .
it &apos;s similar to a jet block .
how about all the world in the world could be radically innovative ?
look at this .
boy , if you &apos;re in our livestock , and a diplomatic biologist sees a way of eating our goats , it &apos;s very nervous . then go to him .
we suffered hunger .
our tradition looks like this : there &apos;s a holy fire in every single single game .
now , until now , we were with support of the world wildlife fund in the position of being able to raise all sorts of programs with the data of the world .
also , very important -- we invest the money in the enlightenment about aids and hiv .
and so , again , a lot of the time in the world in the world of the world &apos;s population -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful means .
and we hide this award behind huge gains .
dan awuah and alice &apos;s passionate lead to the gallup revolution for environmental food .
and the stone , shells , oysters , oysters , the baby , the most famous , they were the known species .
this is like a cocktail of protein .
science sees the world through the mind , the word of the mental , things that can be measured and described , but you have the art to know a framework and knowledge .
from a few cameras , a plan was a plan for three weeks to a plan .
this is the natural cycle .
it would not usually do a photographer , a photograph that &apos;s like to be a photo , right ? but sometimes it has to be , to show the dimensions .
here you see the glacier moving back , and you see the glacier .
this is a couple of cameras .
could india be the origin or a global center for innovation , just as it has become a global center for the public and the water system ?
when we asked people in the conversation to the people in these twin houses , they said , &quot; we &apos;re working on global products . &quot;
you can &apos;t become professor if you weren &apos;t too student .
the best hospitals , in the doctors for cancer cancer , would go to the world , and amd , heart disease , heart disease , for artificial health , to be able to digest four o &apos;clock in the morning .
it works a little bit like -- this is a recently more recent video designer for four in the morning .
i said , i know a very strict message when i see a very strict message .
everybody in our society comes to touch with cancer -- if not personally , then through a beloved person , a family member , a colleague , a friend .
in this space space , the genetic material , the chromosomes , within a nucleus .
we &apos;ve done tumor fields in the lab over 20 different types of cancer , and we see this effect at all .
he got the most powerful .
but what we can see is that in sixth month of the tumor , it &apos;s been responding and it starts to start .
that &apos;s just the beginning .
this is a new cubicle , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re 15 feet deep , and they collect rainwater from the roof , there &apos;s a little pipe , and from their courtyard .
so , water from 300 , 400 miles away , it looks like this .
somewhere is running a stream or a water system through this scene .
this is called agile . english , we have a lot of water and water .
and you have to go further away .
these are the beautiful stairs that we &apos;re seeing on one of the images .
and the oil &apos;s 27 percent is down to 27 percent : 600,000 fewer people per year in sub-saharan africa .
10 percent of india .
they will get the jobs in textiles , which people get out of the ground and bring them to the way to industrialization and prosperity .
and the countries to the right , because they see the most powerful , and basically every country with a computer company , we say , less than 5,000 dollars , we say , three .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india was not so accurate .
buy african products .
but i think a lot of the real problem is that this logic -- that we should drop ipods and not drop bombs -- i mean , it would be a great title for thomas chaplin &apos;s new book .
so , 500 people have been turned to it , and four of them have been selected to visit the institution and they &apos;re going to be able to get to work with it .
so now , citizens with the state of planning in the planning of 2020 , not necessarily will change anything about it , because it &apos;s still the dictators that control the agenda .
so , the internet &apos;s internet is the most powerful thing that &apos;s going to be done ?
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he was having a lot of sudden all around us .
because for me , the time that i was in this period , and in this particular state , the question was , &quot; you want to ? &quot; you want to do it , you know , sex or drugs , and we didn &apos;t take drugs .
i was like paralyzed , people .
as indians , and also politicians and nurses , i &apos;m quite a way to do the most of our country , concerned , to talk about india as a new new zealand , even the new superpower .
in other words , all sorts of things tell us all kinds of different stories about countries , regardless of whether they want to come to daylight or not .
but the flash of the country in the back of our country was pretty slow , it took about half an hour to get a call to a call .
it can &apos;t understand the dialogue .
this can sometimes have unwanted consequences . ok .
and these of you who have the money you have , you might have surprised to see how many of the things that are on the top of the brain , which is the most surprising thing to explain .
i went home and i was doing a little bit of a scary job , and i found some frightening statistics .
so , the silver line of water is a bath without water .
and now i feel like george bush .
now this title , this phrase , comes from a critic , a early critic , and this is a passage that i just love , and i would like to read them .
and that &apos;s a good thing , because if it would be , mother nature would have a problem : how about the world we get to mate with them ?
this is the hardest part , which is not obvious , and so i &apos;ve been able to leave it for the end .
ok ? stop . so , that &apos;s what it is .
i don &apos;t know why there are a lot of people who are , but they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you . thank you .
i suspect that the most likely the most important thing is that we &apos;re going to know why we &apos;re going to be very , very quickly , very quickly , very quickly .
it &apos;s like this . you should look like this .
bob mckim has a different -- another version of this exercise in a pretty famous experiment in a pretty famous experiment .
and we &apos;ve learned that with time : you get a much better , much more creative results , if all of you think of the rules .
and suddenly there was a productive conversation about design around a deep object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little bit skeptical , i &apos;ll come back to it .
you know how it feels , all of these uncertainty , as long as you leave in the corridor , as you get the doctors in one of the most powerful , and you ask yourself what &apos;s going on here .
so we would all feel that we would feel a good time , and we would have a good time , because we agree about the rules and agreed .
we do everything that leads to success , but then if we &apos;re there , we think we &apos;ve done it . we &apos;re just going to be happy to do all that , and just to do that , what &apos;s successful about doing that .
i was faster , but i was just depressed .
i learned that success is not traffic jams .
and the most popular thing is just filled with hot girls . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh my god , &quot; hopefully , for forever , the last time in the public .
he was sure everything fit .
it took 900 people to do this .
and the second thing is that people obviously experience a connection .
these are questions .
as you see in modern liberal democracies , society allows us not only to determine our self , to form our self , but it also requires us .
it means that we meet our full potential as human beings .
so these are the layers that are the types of questions that i wanted to run you through today -- the question : what are the intentions that come to use when they design something ?
so i said , and my colleague sebastian thrun said that there must be better ways .
and we succeeded .
i &apos;m going to give you a fall .
he &apos;s going to put them in the right position , they &apos;re going to be with his nose and beating .
we learned the first surprise .
it had to give any kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of thing to make the amount of force and the speed that we observe and the speed of the system .
a cell load system measures forces and that &apos;s actually a cell load cell cell with a crystal inside .
this is the most powerful -- here &apos;s the heel , and that &apos;s going to swing around and hit the cell load .
a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very powerful solution to the special problem .
and careful : it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean .
i think that &apos;s one of the most beautiful classical folk engineers who have ever been built .
i don &apos;t know any other news projects , not even the other , which is just to benefit that this is a three-dimensional space .
now , you can see that -- it just gives me a stand .
the submarine was out of this last year . this is this one .
so , the understanding of architecture as a design tool , the way that you &apos;re going to be , you know , will be the obvious example -- isn &apos;t the right approach we need to choose .
basically , new york has been built on the back of the mountain , our streets on their shells .
in these eight side boats , they are small bits of water , which are practically the most transformative .
so you walked around in london , and you were overwhelmed with this smell .
finally , snow created a map of the outbreak of the outbreak .
and that &apos;s every second week .
i made her portrait on the top of the temple of the temple .
and in this area of the amazon , in the galapagos , in the &apos; 70s .
the other side of the field is torah , where actually , in osama bin laden , bin laden is supposed to stop . that &apos;s a little bit of a sudden .
this was one of the great most powerful .
this is the most powerful . now let me move and show you the hubble deep field .
but then you get to jupiter and that &apos;s 40 minutes away . that &apos;s a problem .
that will be part of the way that it &apos;s going to get to the beginning of the universe .
we only have a million galaxies .
so this stuff is the stuff that seems to be in the picture , dark matter .
when you saw this picture for the first time , you can &apos;t see a lot in it .
this simulation was performed for 1,000 processors a month , just to do this , just to do this .
with a lot of time , we hope to have a resolution that &apos;s about this image of earth , which is actually the complicated pattern of the earth .
and of course , we are stressed .
47 percent .
this is crazy . we &apos;re constantly doing that , even in the everyday world .
i went into a vicious cycle . that led too many pain and problems with the joints so i could almost hold anything more .
so i asked myself , could you be creative if you look for intent to the constraints ?
the whole thing happened in the morning .
the constant is responsible by the management of the world , as a result of a professional , and there &apos;s a lot of the economic monitoring , and we &apos;re monitoring the persistent monitor of the individuality .
stalin &apos;s famine &apos;s famine was killing the u.n. , killing millions of years , in the &apos; 40s , they saw the nazis , the nazis , burning , they were convicted , they were raised , and they were raised by germany .
because that &apos;s the sadness . &quot;
and as a psychologist , the idea of the most important thing that we &apos;ve learned in the virtual world is that we had learned about what we &apos;ve learned in the virtual world , and we could use it to live in the real world .
we &apos;re used to be a new way of being together alone .
human relationships are lush , chaotic and more cosmopolitan .
it &apos;s got them .
because in the moment , in the people alone , even for a few seconds , they will be able to get a bet , fear , they get panic , they get out of an electronic device .
but we &apos;re in danger because in fact , the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently , we didn &apos;t seem to win any of the most powerful , which was predicted some of our students , and quite often -- pretty often i felt that they had their predictions on financial ways .
maybe my father has read the night .
so i got it in quiet -- but i have to be happy and happy and i had to be happy .
and finally , i thought i was a pyramid , but i &apos;m missing the time , right ?
although you lose , no fear of failure , if we have all of the time , because who can have more desire to give them anything that he &apos;s going to do .
if i should call it names , i never know about it .
did i have enough school bills ?
the second challenge is cells .
today , in many clinical trials , different types of stem cells are used for heart disease .
it &apos;s only last month that we &apos;ve done this technology to show human rights development .
we can then map them and turn to 360 degrees and analyze the kidney in all their programmable properties , and then we can just take this information and scan them in a little bit of the process .
i couldn &apos;t regularly go to school . i was just dirty .
i was a kid , i said , &quot; yes , i want to do this . i want to do this surgery .
you may have noticed that a new area is called fundraising .
and connected to this , there were examples of the world all over the world -- from the choice to the back of a president to the back of the city to the back of the city , and everything else is -- showed what the power of a lot could achieve .
third , more inclusive , unethical environmental issues .
because what you need , that &apos;s the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want a cd , i want to do the music that she plays .
i &apos;m a hot quote , joseph and a member of a member .
we need to have our women and children , we need to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve infrastructure .
late in the night , i went home with batteries and ice .
together , did anybody have notes ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , the master &apos;s master , to give up and work in full-time , to make this happen .
so , the huge spending can be , but if the city can win a number of x volunteers for y hours , the most powerful of the city of the city is going to be the most powerful of the city .
they have a little bit of wood , tables and data .
so these are the ones that have been allowed to be in the 18 minutes to be able to talk to me , between two and a half people who are going to go to cities .
and he was in a wooden nazi mud .
the buildings here have several stories .
these green things are the mangoes .
and if you &apos;re a legal diagnostic system , you have political activities .
i couldn &apos;t know that i would be part of a technological revolution that would let this dream be true .
think about it . these guys who didn &apos;t have the same kind of energy , like me , helped me get through their engaged support , to get mixed with neuroscientists in law .
and then , at the time , the most powerful thing was , in the time , just with a computer company , but by doing a laser , and he used a laser , and he used a machine , and he was able to develop a machine that could read every single single time .
but you know , i think it &apos;s very lonely to read me from machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books about the border , in the different english countries , different versions of the world , the u.k. , united states , canada , and new zealand , they had to have all different kinds of harry potter .
the most powerful . lifespan has been more than doubled and growing , and it grows with a speed of five hours a day .
one last thing . do you wish people like me lucky , okay ?
second , the new machine machine is a good news , because , once the androids take work , we don &apos;t have to do this anymore and that &apos;s the survival of us .
the societal challenges of this inequality should be concerned with .
the economic game is surprising , and surprisingly straightforward , particularly on the short term .
and my biggest concern is that we create a world with a world , embedded with technology , embedded in a slightly more common society and supported by an economy that is affecting inequality .
in the course of the years , i started feeling more and more of the notion of god .
some have the fact that we can only believe in a god that shares our pain .
in the second phase of the world , the line comes from &quot; wind and waves . &quot;
so who is god , if not the big killer or a nuclear or a half ?
the loving soul of the universe .
by looking inside the sky , by looking at my own inwardness .
one of the first things i started studying was the story of the art of technology , &quot; technology . &quot;
we &apos;ve been found not a lot of food , which was older years old , and the average age of this century and collectors is 20 to 30 .
our bodies have used to this new diet .
so this equality of energy and matter , the einstein has shown and also the modern science of the world &apos;s population , which is entropy and information and matter and matter and matter and matter of all of them , so it &apos;s a long continuum .
this is a robot that wants to stick its own yield to get more electricity .
and what i mean with this is we &apos;re looking for your new job .
a great development that has started billions of years ago , moving through us and continues , and our choice is kind of in the technology , is really in it , is really , really careful with this power , which is much more powerful than we do .
and she said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got five classes to get 30 to 40 students .
we were doing all this down and found beautiful plastic bars , and it had a look at this -- while we &apos;ve been told , somebody said , &quot; you know what , it looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
so we waited , we sat on the tables and we waited .
there are many of the things that we have , the only problem , especially for the adults who are doing all the things that didn &apos;t really know anything like they were , that there was only one toilet .
the teachers we work with -- everything is different for teachers -- they tell us what we should do .
about 170 tutors , they worked with them on the book , and so that &apos;s wonderful .
and right behind -- there &apos;s usually a small chain -- right behind it , they were taught like children .
there &apos;s also this kind of dna -- it &apos;s a shelf that you don &apos;t see if you &apos;re in the street , but it &apos;s slowly opening up .
he &apos;s a little bit of a time . he &apos;s bringing his cousins .
he &apos;s writing an email , he will tell you every question you can answer .
i was this girl .
80 percent of refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s a side that thinks that peace means the end of the struggle , and there &apos;s a side that is that peace thinks that peace is the creation of schools and jobs .
she sent her children to school -- found a new home .
there &apos;s one that &apos;s going to be a full of &quot; manual for complete idiots , &quot; did you know ?
on cape , there &apos;s a street street , and we can all drive here .
that &apos;s my baby &apos;s baby . thank you .
he basically said , &quot; i &apos;ve designed everything . &quot;
and in a certain sense , i always felt bad .
so i came up with this kind of complications .
and i found cheetos that cheetos are very good .
the university is the most difficult , so number 10 is hard .
from all in a strange fashion debate about a window , which is a window to the moment , which was the moment that the street had been black , and that white carbon strip there was in the sun .
and i was reminded by the great presentation of karen armstrong &apos;s that religion really understood nothing right with faith , but to do with behavior .
the most profound , geographically seen , has the same size . it doesn &apos;t look like this , but it &apos;s exactly the same size as the united states , leaving a field that &apos;s about the same size of the state of arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the developed developed world .
we can &apos;t wait for the most successful , the australia had to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of our whole civilization .
a new appreciation of the design system that we have through the assumption of this challenge .
before i show you a few pictures of the preview , i want to point out on this beautiful detail about the design of design and design .
rca is really a really extraordinary school .
we &apos;ve been discussing this morning with keith , that many scientists don &apos;t tend to show something beautiful in their talks , fear , as stupid as a stupid thing .
here &apos;s what you &apos;re looking for , you can already print textiles in 3d , which is very interesting .
so that makes us think more about what robots mean for us .
no . so i had to think a little sharper .
we did the same for iraq .
that was a challenge we had to ask as a physicist .
we can push it up . the forces are more restrained . there are more of them , but they &apos;re weaker .
&quot; collaborative 7 &quot; a whole band of the world .
and there are some employees in foundations called this &quot; the &quot; the &quot; of the &quot; . &quot;
the idea of justice , which shows our lives , and gives us a sense of what is right in life , which is just in life , which is what we should do , social justice .
and as it is , he &apos;s going to be a while , as it &apos;s in the prison industry .
so every week , the most powerful one would come up with the world &apos;s office . &quot; god , you &apos;ve answered me . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , infection , an infection or a surgery .
the muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- the so-called -- the so-called .
we treat them with the drugs -- the ones that are , frankly , the way that pain is not very effective .
now , you get a sense of how much rock we &apos;re talking about here .
it was 1908 . doesn &apos;t do anything .
i don &apos;t know if you can see it from the back of the road , and these are just stars .
in 2005 , nasa started a probe called deep impact , which one -- that &apos;s a part of the core of a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , as i said , engineers .
the difference between dinosaurs and us is we have a more powerful and choosing , and we can change our future .
i &apos;ve led to this time , the only independent , to be exactly the only electronic medium of the country .
and i thought that the media service would survive and a great company would be if the military would only be gone , what was turned out to be right .
and at the end of the meeting , he says , look , it &apos;s not going to work , you will never see your money again . but my foundation will put 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test the idea .
and we said , that &apos;s okay , we &apos;re all meeting , we get your business business with what you actually did .
see , we started in afghanistan and central our work , and we went to russia .
after a while , we opened a solar system .
and we &apos;ve developed the idea , to spend bonds on the open press .
and in this way , you have the funding , so that it doesn &apos;t have a more inclusive , no blind , running around to find .
so , why does it work ? that &apos;s the question .
now , some of these are called a theory of everything .
just an example is that , newton found the law of gravity , which works like one by the square of the mountain of the world between each other &apos;s population .
the more symmetry you have , the better you get the simplicity and elegance of theory .
one thing he thought most of us are now given to the most of us today , but at its time , it wasn &apos;t natural .
it doesn &apos;t matter the meaning of the fan that they &apos;re following the rules of the rules , and accidents .
but he read in every free moment that he had , books .
from this ambition , he went back to the prison team .
but when he was just doing this , his signature under the top was to put his signature deaf and was yelling , because he had a thousand hands on a prison &apos;s morning .
not very surprising -- it was only three women under the white house in the white house .
but i have to say , the older i became , the more i understand what an incredible privilege was to have , with this aging lion of a man , so many hours .
and as lincoln told the story , all after the war after the u.k.
i asked my father under tears , &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
what the reason is that i &apos;m going to be grateful for this strange love of history that allows me to spend a life in back to the past .
he had the temple of the temple and he had a baby .
this is the most popular thing that the jews is , that the jews after exile , after all the years , they sat in babylon , and in the way that they were in babylon , they were going to be able to go home .
all of these are informed .
the main cylinder is from the priests of the great art of babylon , marduk , writing .
they all know what happened then .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of people came to tehran , and they came to tehran .
some people know more about the state of conditions , but they still think they &apos;re a kind of a friendly error .
the new chocolate owner of the baby cried in the first few hours , but their needs were not satisfied and eventually they were learning to try and do it in less days , and in less days , they were domesticated , and they &apos;re all starting to get out of the air like everybody else .
a study shows that spending 10 percent of a family &apos;s cost costs , while the cost of 30 percent costs .
and i was fascinated by that , because i &apos;ve been spent my entire life on a camera .
you know , you know , you &apos;re very quick to do what you have to find a answer .
it was 42 people there -- most of them and family .
we heard each one .
but of course , he never came . the explanation has never happened .
and after many , many meetings i was thrilled that this man , mmm , , really , one of my heroes and mentors , did it , and the builders get to the boat .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones who believed in peace and his opportunities , etc . , and they were actually going to be told .
we connect with the data of the -- i met the street , and i said , &quot; at london 2012 , i said , &quot; at london 2012 , i said to you .
it &apos;s about their own business , to do their business .
the biggest brains of the world should also be cognitively capable of the cognitively .
i went to the literature of this number , but i could never find them .
there &apos;s just a brain brain .
and amazingly , it &apos;s exactly what our ancestors have invented a hundred million years ago , when they discovered cooking .
quite simple ways for the online of the mouse that i led .
and i think i &apos;m just standing at the beginning .
but once the struggle is the struggle , the physical rehabilitation was exposed .
behind him was a kid , his son , red in the face of effort , his father .
but mahmoud and his son were there .
i was talking to my boss at the headquarters , and i told them -- i &apos;m going to tell you , i &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; look , we &apos;re going to start with a few hours a day , just for some purposes . &quot;
two groups of the world &apos;s population started fighting .
so i asked him , &quot; what &apos;s it going on ? &quot;
&quot; yes , we need to increase the production of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
and it &apos;s not just in the orthopedic center , but in the home of people &apos;s homes .
and you should see me during a computer scanner .
and this hospital could have been able to do this hospital .
why ? because the way i had was banned .
but i learned something about a little bit more like that , which is that the leaders of the economy -- the manager of the economy , the great bad decisions made our economy short before the collapse .
because i knew that the state of african continent would be important for my children and their children .
i &apos;m trying to get the experience that i had in swarthmore , to africa .
i &apos;ve gone to my time ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment from a great society in a generation .
you &apos;ll notice that it &apos;s very similar to the ted needle , the sun that we draw as children .
in fact , that &apos;s something that &apos;s about half of you , more than half , not being familiar with .
32 pills of the rabbit &apos;s rabbit .
i think it &apos;s a lot of time . &quot;
and these are the messages that they &apos;re carrying to them ?
because , in the bottom line , the sponsors , the sponsors , and so he brings them up to television .
a professional executive who talks about dead , she doesn &apos;t get me ?
what is euler ?
we &apos;d like to have a quick set of people , how to put people out of the way , and they were offering their support skills , and they were doing a support of support , so they do something .
thank you .
so the entire hospital is often going on to a generator .
there must be something better . &quot;
but that &apos;s how the user can control whether there &apos;s only electricity or not , because they can control the most powerful on the ground , how much percent oxygen you give .
but we &apos;re sure that this is the most effective and the most safe device that we can provide hospitals to do .
the different types of writing in africa , the first one was the first one , like the script of the secret , which is the secret of a secret society of the internet of the world in the city of the world .
anyway , as a computer writer , as a computer named john atala in the prison department in the prison district in the northern pacific district , discovered in the northern pacific city , in the coastal city of the city , in 1800 , the centuries ago .
almost one fifth of the greenhouse gases is from the livestock , which is more than the traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and the wildlife of the assembly and animals like tools to produce the tools is not just right .
and the computer &apos;s day was a french issue .
a picture of fish fish would be better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t quite bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
some of us would be able to do that , maybe not so bad .
i asked myself a year ago , &quot; why am i , although i know what i know , not a vegetarian ? &quot;
you have the election .
you can make a picture with a iphone and get all the names , even though it &apos;s even more errors .
it &apos;s got distracted . he &apos;s going to win the race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would think it was from interest , more about trying to figure out what the operations is like , but it &apos;s a very , very reactive area .
or an aesthetic experience -- an sunset or a big piece of art .
the human nature has to change .
but part of the reason -- and that &apos;s why we have an ethical level in the visual of that -- is that they &apos;re intrinsically valuable .
it could be more complicated to people , but maybe not very .
jh : is it more liberating to play with these forces ?
and so i knew that i need something to go to the remote control .
so there &apos;s a lot of time , because there &apos;s a huge behavior , because it &apos;s the dynamic behavior of liquid .
and so i think that you can be a little bit of the way .
this is a great cambridge studio in the studio .
we take the pizza , our first pizza , and we reject the individual slices while the messenger in the hallway is standing and we &apos;re going to be able to get us .
i was definitely 20 before i first went to an art museum .
i thought , okay , you have some criteria like you want to choose the works .
it &apos;s not photoshop .
they &apos;re interested in creating a novel alternative , alternatives , and they needed money for making some interesting fundraising projects .
this project is called &quot; the &quot; hippo . &quot;
and so we went to grave and made it a compelling -- the attention that we got .
and she describes how the most powerful -- everything you say is because of the most successful crows .
he &apos;s a wiki video of native people , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it &apos;s with origami . so , go .
people were working mathematical principles on the art to understand the underlying rules .
or they &apos;re going to take it on the top and do 50 stars on a flag with 13 stripes .
how would you make a single flap ?
we found these rules with those that you put circles into the surface , you pour the surface of the lines with lines that obey the extra rules .
you can do a lot of things .
but , if you want to make it bigger , you could need some origami .
and that doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re in space or whether you &apos;re going into your body .
i grew up in a corporate state in the state of washington with a lot of time .
we only have three minutes . but we &apos;re talking about this for hours .
and so i want to talk about that because if we don &apos;t recognize it , this transformation is very painful .
and in a moment , i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;re going to see in the graph -- it starts in 1973 , just before the women start to go to the labor market , and it goes on to the day .
you gave instructions from up .
because i write about all this a book , i still don &apos;t have a question , and i don &apos;t have an answer to that .
and that was very disheartening for them .
there &apos;s no way that we &apos;ve been working on this information , and they come back to us in the form of culture , in this weird and subtle way where they can see that stereotypes change .
there &apos;s no man or a woman who &apos;s in the middle , and it &apos;s the wire to mobilize the cable .
and the personal income on a scale that was held to mind the order of inflation to consider inflation , in this time , has almost tripled .
and to hear me , and understand what i say , you need about 60 bits per second .
and it &apos;s going to happen , so in the last book of me called &quot; good business , &quot; i interviewed some ceo that was very successful from their surroundings as a very successful and very ethical , with great social sense .
control is always a safe thing , because you feel in your mind , but not very useful .
&quot; where are you born , grew up and went to school ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they had their own meaning for what home is . they had their meaning for community , and even for hostility , which was about birth to antiretroviral drugs . they didn &apos;t really have the possibility of walking beyond .
more and more people are also exploring in the future , or the present , as in the past .
i went down to the room where i should sleep .
so , the point of interest : where is home ?
there was a big gap between one billion in the industrialized countries and the two billion in the developing world .
but that &apos;s the world we have today . no gap .
and let me show you why , by the way , by the very limiting , digital technology .
the children survive the new green .
and again , they were better than we said , &quot; your british and your mortality rate is shocking . &quot;
but if you give people a lot of people , you don &apos;t change the high number of heart disease .
and i immediately started working with the work of work , and then they grew up , and then i worked with a lot of time -- mice that couldn &apos;t produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my mother-in-law , and of course , i don &apos;t know how old she is .
if you could be at the summer , you could be the equator at the equator .
certainly many advances , many of the things that live .
this is actually real photography , the time that it &apos;s a time , that &apos;s the piece of the limb inside of a day .
and here you see , on the right , what six months later is what &apos;s happening , technically , the most technically appropriate .
blood vessel is made from two different types of cell types .
we put it back into this oven-like device .
even more complex organs . with the most complex solid organs , the most complex solid organs are the ones that are high , with every amount of blood vessel organs like heart , liver and kidneys .
this is still in the middle of the street .
we prefer cells that don &apos;t reject and form tumors .
we just need five seconds .
for every problem there would have been a idea .
so i &apos;m immediately in panic -- unlike all of the infinity and sugar , which i had -- but this is a really scary one .
that doesn &apos;t mean you have to visit a more powerful .
i went door to door and sold license license .
it &apos;s like a recession . so , there &apos;s a recession .
and you would do these chairs .
that &apos;s pointless . &quot; you have to find a way to get faster to get money .
i sold a lot of buffalo .
they don &apos;t get regular income , but they have the opportunity to find more tasks and they learn to learn the ability of the design , and they learn the ability to find more possibilities .
if you go to a restaurant and use bad service , you &apos;ll show them how bad customer service looks like .
these young , locust .
the development of the students today is all the interests of the world .
the most powerful of the computer or a cultural impact on cultural reserve is the most of our students .
the values of the past are also emerging . that &apos;s what they do .
but it &apos;s a policy of principles , not the most important .
they have a mind . and they have other people .
what we should be concerned about when we think about conservatives -- except this case of the 1980s -- what &apos;s going on here , is this : you go to church .
yeah , i know you don &apos;t really believe me .
and that doesn &apos;t just lead to another outcome , it has the potential to change how we deal with each other .
completely different .
actually , this is not an organization , but clearly -- let me close this -- creative commons offers a simple way to get a way to the freedoms that you want to leave them with .
john mccain .
and i wonder how often something happens .
he told me that he was the most violent and then he said , &quot; there &apos;s a snake in the next room , and we &apos;re going to now be now going to be now . &quot;
so , for today , i had the idea that i run it through this process and show you how this journey looks like .
and the hospital and general electric were happy too .
i was living , just to understand ourselves .
i &apos;m constantly asked by people , &quot; is it really possible to use this microbial ecosystems to our advantage ? &quot;
another way of how microbes can spread is through the people . architects like to deliver spaces like that , like to bring the human interaction or the exchange of ideas in which the future of ideas and offices are to promote the neighborhoods .
imagine a design that is taking phosphorus , like , for example , in the airplane or a phone .
and nobody knew about it .
my company , the company , built a system called the guide for apple macintosh .
in 1992 , his essay was rejected by the most violent .
and greenpeace wanted to do this , and a method that you wanted to do , and one of these humpback whales was a little bit of a traffic factory .
at 78 percent of the voices , to give you a picture of the victory victory : &quot; in fact , two percent of the world &apos;s population is only three percent .
and the last message i want to tell you is : you can be very successful online .
i think i don &apos;t need to explain what a big privilege it is to stand with today .
this is the school that was built with the community .
something that we have in gando are the ones that we have in gando .
just like that .
good morning . magic is a great way to be ahead of the world &apos;s life , to make the way that science really gets to be able to do .
there &apos;s the color red , and the color black , they &apos;re going to be the extra change of day .
voice : why not ? that &apos;s a very good piece .
this is an illusion .
so this is china , a civilization-state , and not so much a nation-state .
but you can &apos;t have a country like china , a civilization-state , on the ground of a civilization , a system .
and the reason is , first of all , the state in china gets a very special -- enjoy a very special value than the representative and the dmca , the embodiment of chinese civilization , the most powerful and the dmca &apos;s chief of chinese civilization .
he was in &apos; 92 , in 1977 , in the city of the city , and shanghai .
we &apos;ve seen this in terms of the continuous -- the position of the ocean &apos;s position , and the experimenter are rapidly refined .
he goes down to the railroad corner , and he &apos;s going to drive the cars under the area .
red = drums blue bass green = green = green = orange = = signed up ...
and the first song was english , the second was on chinese .
she agreed her song .
i made graffiti , wrote my name everywhere , used the city as a canvas .
i mean , these were the faces of my friends .
they all have accepted that their image would be fired next to each other .
&quot; you mean , you &apos;re a viewing face -- you &apos;re going to cut a face here , right here ? &quot;
most places i went to go to , i decided to go to the media , because i had heard about them .
i took more pictures and we launched the project .
are you an ngo ? are you from the media ? &quot;
so the roofs were dead , a woman , &quot; now , i can see god . &quot;
because this is a big part of it . there &apos;s layers behind each photograph .
but they basically took me a promise of a promise .
or , &quot; how can we help . &quot;
when i think about the neural and what they &apos;re driving , why it &apos;s going to be , i think there are some factors that i want to give you as a design .
they have caused a trend .
zipcar started a decade ago , in 2000 .
it challenges to participate . cities have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to .
it &apos;s very inexpensive , and it &apos;s very , very inexpensive .
the last 40 years was extraordinary times .
and also miniaturization .
that would deliver a major design system .
it &apos;s vital that at ted , the ideas that we think about , and we &apos;re going to be able to think about it , and we &apos;re sure that this is a particularly dear century , and not one of the most beautiful and a half .
my left family are boring academics who are concerned with the people who are involved in the world of the world .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet the prime minister . &quot;
i thought he would be crazy , but it really remained .
i was sitting there , like you &apos;re here , in the audience .
this is another picture .
since netra , netra , my career was taking a lot of success .
i started exploring the most powerful of human psyche .
this time i said , let &apos;s try something else .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much better . einstein &apos;s very honored to be here at ted 2006 in the middle of the einstein &apos;s today . actually , it &apos;s very excited .
it would be very dangerous if you would fall away .

the body has higher density than the water is coming from , at least 95 percent of the body is coming from itself .
and it &apos;s going to get it very far .
i asked him what that means .
so , you can imagine , if you want to , multiple languages are going to be , and they &apos;re taking it without each other .
and she looked up to me and said , &quot; well , that &apos;s what it is . &quot;
i think they agree with me that they &apos;re very good at me .
and have done tests with 50,000 students , and they &apos;ve done about half a dozen schools , and my readers , by the way .
we found out -- and we were pretty much wrong with a lot of things and then we found it -- but we found that the young people loved it .
geoff blakley : a small introduction to the ted revolution
and ultimately , the only person who &apos;s continuing to step forward , a young shepherd , and he goes to saul and says , &quot; i &apos;m going to fight him . &quot;
there &apos;s the cavalry , men on horses and with a lot of time .
goliath is easy prey . he &apos;s got no chance .
so goliath is a long time to be greater than the time , and usually there &apos;s an explanation for if someone is so far outside the norm .
and i think that &apos;s a very important lesson for all of us .
and it turns out we are covered by a gas system , and these microbes are actually doing well , rather than killing us .
they have all the microbes and they put the small into the receiver .
most pills , or the most toxic , the ones you can eat , or two , maybe five species , and the human community has thousands of species .
we need a more powerful for the microbes that live in and on people , so we can understand what they are doing .
very many people think about the internet very much on the english , but for us , it &apos;s really global . we &apos;re in many , many languages .
when she was doing a silly change at the side of me , they thought that it would just be easy in rubbish .
it &apos;s a social concept of cooperation , so we don &apos;t talk much about truth and objectivity .

it seems to me , when most textbooks , the education of our children are being biased from being biased .
in guatemala , in guatemala , a temple is a temple .

it &apos;s far under your cognitive experience .
we found activity in other areas -- in areas that are associated with computation and loss .
i have a friend that &apos;s just a terrible thing to manage .
and i said , i don &apos;t know .
we turn to each other , and we keep our look &quot; based &quot; and we &apos;re talking .
tools like paypal , knife , hollow or refined , which i had fired in a towel .
i had looked for a long time , and i had never looked for my long way .
in some of the cases they put tools , about sponges , to the most elastic .
so dolphins can be able to restore and tickle them from the distance .
look how they synchronize with their partner and the other of the other .
but we found out quickly that free dolphins are not just going to be so on on a boat at a keyboard .
this dolphin called &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; , because it &apos;s about 12 to 12 percent of the time .
but while we imitate their natural sounds , we also plan to bring this back into the computer system .

we don &apos;t say that to your employer .
but it was up to the top of the doctrines and full of cacti .
and they wonder , what they thought , what they saw was to explain what was going on by invisible powers .
because this event was the scientific revolution since our knowledge of the physical world , and how we can adapt to our needs , is going to be able to grow .
by the way , why don &apos;t we do that ?
your seat is on assumptions ; our on the bible . &quot;
there &apos;s something like a kind of a story of a story .
and only if an explanation is good , it &apos;s also important that you can check them .

i &apos;m going to show you pictures of the internet , and i &apos;m going to show you the images of the polar revolution and the polar bears and leopard seals and leopard seals , but this picture is what i &apos;ve ever done .
people said , &quot; we knew they &apos;re malignant . we knew it . &quot;
and this seal took the penguin and she shook it and she shook it back .
she swam away , started a penguin .

paul collier : stories from a design of disgust
now , open your eyes now .
do you have a ring ?
you &apos;re going to focus on this task .
joe , we &apos;re doing this so long until they tear it up .
funny , yes , we have a little man , a little bit of a man , working up there , and it &apos;s a whole day .
as i said , it &apos;s a reality form .
first of all , we worked together , and we started to build ushahidi and develop .
a call in the united states , after canada , or china , costs five main dollars , or the u.s. &apos;s worth of dollars .
it &apos;s built in a way that you can also connect a more , and so on , and also , in remote places , have become available .
and the building has been higher and bigger , and the technology has always been better , so the mechanical systems were enormously powerful .
imagine two americans traveling together through italy .
please raise all the rest of the world as an liberal .
the best definition of the &quot; i know &quot; -- she explains so much -- comes from the freudian gary brian .
it makes us very , very old line of forces .
but look at the other three lines on the other side .
aren &apos;t that easy to be the foundation of the computer and the computer and the internet and the internet ?
she went upward and continued to keep up .
and they say , &quot; hold your laws away from my body . &quot;
and we have the signs of the right , the most violent , the liberal god -- and both work together .
and so the answer is , i think , to use these passionate commitment to truth and try to turn them into a better future for all of us .
but if you react to a lot of other people in the environment , the innocent , but also being hurt -- the military would not like to talk about damage .
we look at something else , &quot; and it doesn &apos;t seem to be that the situations were really comparable .
do anybody have a commandment , how often if you think about how many times the police were in queensland , how often the police were given in queensland ?
there was only a few people shot in this incident .
it &apos;s 72 and it looks like this is the kind of the most powerful way of dealing with it .
and if you &apos;re to use it , people will give them to give them a little bit of people , but they should not cause a memorable damage . &quot;
we started organizing makers in our &quot; maker fair . &quot;
and the more fun , or some billy bass , or something like that .
and i &apos;ll tell you more about it , but just ...
but he also moved here to other people who did the same as he did .
this is &quot; the &quot; guide . &quot;
and we need to bring that into the schools , or in the communities , many species -- the ability to build the world around us and form new ones .
there &apos;s the glamour of physics .
and in fact , we see these miniature photos of stars that are all the time -- they call them the same .
it doesn &apos;t look like a way of doing , but you have to really imagine your world .
stairs , the bottom of a river winds , are glamorous .
but it &apos;s always going to give you the illusion that if you buy this lamp , you &apos;re going to live in a world without wires .
the perfect thing -- it &apos;s about the perfect chain , with the perfect chain of water .
because glamour can be very malleable and deceptively .
but i also knew how hard they worked for the week .
i did that a lot of strangers .
i heard about women who were punished in their homes , or in the closet , in their own business , as dead left on parking parking , burned in their kitchens .
then i got cancer -- or i found that i had cancer .
my friend was making this big bowl and i asked them , &quot; what is this ? &quot;
it was for me , and a loving sister , and a loving sister .

first , i &apos;ll prove you that it &apos;s a little bit of a research .
please tell me that you don &apos;t have a lot of time , if , let &apos;s say the pentagon called the pentagon .
but why do you have to feel anything ?
and it was , you know , you know , a course of a health company .
and second , is it possible , or even pit overflow , slow down to the end of the pit ?
they want to go back to a slow rhythm .
and norway , sweden , denmark and finland are under the six of the world &apos;s six countries in the world and working hours , where the average american would cry envy .
but the new idea that &apos;s revolutionary idea of the idea is that there are so much as good slowing .
i &apos;m finding the story of the story as a subject of a training task on my ted conference , and it was just to me , because they were so slow and i wanted to be quickly .
and so everything started to get his early , and they said , &quot; you can &apos;t build anything on a island ; it has to stay on the bank , because we don &apos;t want to penetrate from the community . &quot;
i worked on my day and i didn &apos;t work with it because i felt that people who came from the historical museum were already filled with information . if they see a museum with information , they wouldn &apos;t process that anymore .
when i flew home , the most profound thing was planned .
but you see the uniqueness of the environment .
moshe khanfar : how to build the uniqueness of uniqueness
and as christian played a note -- for example , a f.
so in jazz , the most amazing thing is the most amazing thing .
it &apos;s not about my vision , or something like that .

they had to go to a lot of work here .
in summer , india is drifting , it &apos;s extremely hot .
and the adult animal that comes out of that is still a decade or two months .
i didn &apos;t know that , but i know it today . these are hundreds of times species of species .
this was a little curious , i &apos;m going to hear , i &apos;m going to stop here , because i want to ask you . and here &apos;s a lot of people who have -- of course , people who have spent their childhood .
so , next , i was going to the phone .
october , november , december . that &apos;s not the time of the northeast monsoon .
okay , they put their eggs on the rainy rains , while the most prolific .
only last week , it &apos;s got a little bit of time , and the most prolific , and now it &apos;s raining it .
a pretty incredible animal system .
incredible . this is the most powerful race of a computer &apos;s license . a pretty incredible journey .
i made this out of my life .
and everybody thought , i &apos;d be good . but on the new terrain , i was terrible . people said , &quot; oh , he &apos;s -- oh , what &apos;s happened with tomato sauce ? &quot;
and i was looking at them at night before i was going to get to my surgery , and i said , &quot; how do i do that ? &quot;
next -- oh , wait . these guys are the community .
so i was pretty successful . and if you &apos;ve achieved all this , what is it going to drive ? i have a lot of the most powerful and other things , but what &apos;s going to be going to be ?
in my last tedtalk , about seven years ago .
but carl norden really has cracked the code .
whenever the norden bombsight gets brought to an airplane , it &apos;s accompanied by a series of punch guards .
the chemical chemical plant is on the three square miles .
after the war , there was a review of reference -- like the army , the air force , the force force -- and they asked the question : how many of the things we have actually destroyed ?
i &apos;ve described the opposite of a success story .
a walk in a city or a journey of this diversity shows the diversity of human species on amazing ways .
we &apos;re asking the human ancestry .
but what data is the claims ?
imagine that you have to convey .
it was an african , and the global diversity of the world &apos;s population is based on the global diversity .
the sahara was much bigger than today .
people who are being engaged in the animals who are getting into the u.s. &apos;s office , moved north and followed about 45,000 years ago in the middle east in a rare period of the sahara .
the genome genome , the security genome on mars .
we know deep in our hearts that the universe doesn &apos;t move from mush to complexity .
so there we go .
what you see here is the blue areas of cooler than the red areas .
the more than the damage is that it works , which explains why it and i are smaller than the stars and planets .
they &apos;re going to be familiar with the helix helix .
let me explain why .
in the last 200 years , something else happened .
you might ask yourself , &quot; what &apos;s the talk ? &quot;
we &apos;re not so good if it &apos;s about insurance insurance .
and then you have to decide how to invest in your 52 choices , and you &apos;ve never heard of a car .
at least a wonderful study , it predicted .
but if you get the driver &apos;s license , you cross the box when you don &apos;t want to donate the organs .
the other group gets two apples , one will taken .

that &apos;s just an example .
it &apos;s a song about a so-called called a creature that mimics a creature that is being adaptive again .
hello , who is because there , please ?
thank you .
knowledge has too much influence on the life life .
i &apos;m trying to make time to go .
so what did i do ?
we invent stories to explain our existence .
so what did they do ? they sent her walter raleigh to separate her human part of her divine part .
are you a kid ?
elizabeth : get out ! get out ! get out !
i went to visit a friend of mine and he took me waiting in his apartment in the apartment in the 1900s , a really rich area in mumbai .
everything is a contradiction .
we &apos;ve lived from less than a dollar on a day -- about 15 years .
and you have to use nuts from the rainforests to show that forests are more value than a forest than a dollar . &quot;
he said , &quot; you can &apos;t wake up a person who &apos;s going to be sleeping . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about people ; it &apos;s about pathways .
if you should be sustainable , if you &apos;re going to be sustainable , how can we do this ?
coke needs to work with pepsi .
these are nine of them .
at the end , i think , i think , 60 percent of the world &apos;s production , and 25 percent of the world &apos;s population .
that &apos;s not irrelevant .
but they don &apos;t just buy the juice ; they also buy the carbon in the trees to come across the surface of the world to get the product of the product to europe .
so the communication between brain and spinal cord is interrupted ; this leads to a full and permanent paralysis of the leg .
after several years , it &apos;s made us develop a real-time vitality that &apos;s created that nervous system of a sleeping system in a refrigerator .
we &apos;ve worked hard for 10 years to do this goal .
after a few weeks , we have a programmable pump to inject a individual type of individual information directly into the spinal cord .
and i was a kid of the research .
he talked about the world , as she &apos;s , &quot; and the world , how to be . &quot;
and by doing that , these women , they do a lot of obstacles from the way .
in the white house , and the desk he sits in , &quot; the car &apos;s worth of life . &quot;
the last day , the woman who had been there , and we talked about all the time , and we said , &quot; would you like to sing me ? &quot;
for this , this is a quantum design , a little bit of a plastic , because it &apos;s mysterious -- it &apos;s totally unexpected , and it &apos;s originally done .
they didn &apos;t have anything .
so the internet needs the internet and instructions .
one of the most popular websites in the world that &apos;s run by the most powerful company of the world , and there was nothing , and there were no , youtube , or google .
and today , wikipedia is so ubiquitous that you can actually find them on the cards of restaurants in china .
and that has wikipedia understood .
this is a blog that &apos;s going to be a video of creativity .
why ? there &apos;s a more nuanced thing in the computer .
the world didn &apos;t end in the &apos; 90s .
and we see that the impact of the ecosystem on the ground is very , very strong .
all of this costs money .
and it was much more difficult to give students to the computer , or from social , and the same opportunity to give up the opportunity .
how are schools represented and teachers in the media ?
in the bureaucratic systems , teachers are leaving in classes alone , and they have a lot of the people who have been able to keep themselves on a lot of their hands .
some people say that the change of the world &apos;s life is a bit like a more powerful one .
but if you look at the issue from this perspective , you see what &apos;s happening in the last 60 years .
and i went to the morning about 15 miles to get the most of the time .
so this was obviously a very clear device .
we could also do that with telephones .
so a business is created for you .
&quot; government must offer economically services to use . &quot;
it was once , long ago , long ago , when i was 24 years old , i studied in st. college , in bangalore , in bangalore .
and you can see my card when i &apos;m here .
and i also bring a invention with this .
now we &apos;re in the 1930s , and you see japan goes through a time of war , with lower life expectancy .
and they decided not only to invest in health and education , but also started to grow the economy .
washington , d.c. went out .
not the bubble , not my bubbles , but the financial bubble .
will the land have a completely altered countries in the world , really accept , and the transition transition of where they were over the last 50 to 150 years , and the transition of the world &apos;s power .
the rest of the diagram is a very mysterious substance called dark energy .
but that &apos;s not what the presence of the whole mass is not .
and now you pay attention to the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe -- a three-dimensional space .
again , this is a kind of a model model of what &apos;s going on during the back of the brain .
they &apos;re moving away because the space is going to be bigger .
by looking at things like clusters of galaxies -- their energy companies , how many of you are there , we can get it in experience of time -- we can get in experience , which is dark matter and dark energy in the competition to form structures .
the big questions in physics .
sleepy people , the world &apos;s life , is the world &apos;s life -- new jersey ?

and in fact , there was this change in gay men in the 1980s during the 1980s .
it &apos;s a disease that kills a lot of adults in africa , and also many children .
in uganda , we see that the prevalence gave up .
it &apos;s a pretty similar ending to this .
but openness and connection has a price when we think about disease . that should not be surprise .
coffee is uganda &apos;s shark .
emily paravicini , again , is the aids statistic in africa in africa , and comes to a surprising implication : all of our knowledge about the spread of hiv on the continent is wrong .
but i was fascinated by this , because i watched this kind of airplane maker design .
he was called &quot; the &quot; cat &apos;s favorite &quot; , called , &quot; because he was the front of the day , but every time he was in a tunnel , he built a joint effect . &quot;
these hump are working on the water like a magnet .
then we ask ourselves why the membrane is clogged and why it takes so much electricity .
for example , in the most violent of the street in a material .
in the computer of the day , my favorite , i &apos;m working with the most powerful architect , we work with the most violent architect .
janine benyus : biomimicry in the use
&quot; yes , but why ? &quot;
we were four , not one , and fortunately , not a boy .
you can &apos;t do anything about it .
it &apos;s never going to happen in india , because it was now and never again .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s say , &quot; well , let &apos;s pray . &quot;
this was a very , very talkative for about 1,000 inmates in this prison .
second , it &apos;s about the most powerful movement in india .
now let me tell you about a project that we did a few years later , a kind of evolution of captcha .
it &apos;s basically what you &apos;re doing by the old book .
the number of pages that exploit the recaptcha is actually so high that the number of words we digitize a day is very , very big .
some are more fun .
and the web is divided in several languages .
then my favorite story comes from the question .
there &apos;s a way to beat two flies with a beat .
but what perhaps happened more surprising is that the translations that we get from the most sophisticated , even if they &apos;re just just a beginner that we &apos;re getting are equally accurate , how the professional professional people , and that &apos;s very surprising .
there &apos;s a value of people who have been learning , they don &apos;t have to pay money , pay them with their time .
the component of the company , the company , does what you really can do .
and the active participation to build is all other than normal .
and zipcar provides a very helpful , very powerful service that works fantastic .
for aristotle , happiness was the highest good , the goal , to the whole thing .
maybe these people are right . his thoughts is , maybe , not good .
ten percent of the time people have the thought -- ... in sex .
i played the violent african , the african terrorists .
now , from the first time , no clearer didn &apos;t get a separate driver -- so no one was the absolute majority -- so the elections went on in a second round three weeks later .
now here &apos;s a very interesting comparison .
so i went to la jolla , and i learned surfing .
people in the 17th century didn &apos;t really have much idea how we think that this stuff is a bunch of different molecules , and that we &apos;re not breathing that from a certain reason .
and so , charles said , i &apos;m going to give you money to give you a building , and you can meet you there , but you don &apos;t talk about religion .
reality is what you can see .
i thought everybody would do a little bit of a mind that would do that .
just to see what would happen if you mix the two together .
so i have something that &apos;s not personally .
if you want to be rich today , entrepreneurs will be entrepreneurs .
they say , if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , it &apos;s not going to go up -- it &apos;s not going to go all the way up . we &apos;re not going to measure this for 20 years , and it &apos;s not going to go up .

&quot; naked city &quot; is a nickname for new york and &quot; the &quot; car city &quot; that comes out of the sense of the feeling of the world &apos;s feeling in a urban environment .
i love traveling , and berlin has become one of my favorite classes .
and the whole time i haven &apos;t seen a single rat on some of these places until recently , when i was in london , in the london channels .
the first question is , and maybe they &apos;re writing them , either on a sheet of paper , physically , or on a virtual slate in their head , and , for audiences , they can try to try and test that .
and we would stop , &quot; we &apos;re the best scientific college in the world , &quot; because of our british hubris .
except that -- they &apos;re -- well , you &apos;re in your low-fat , you thought , &quot; hmm , what &apos;s going on during the night ? &quot;
and one of the most difficult problems is , when people have a notion of how everything works , it &apos;s pretty difficult to change these .
and as an expert for inorganic chemistry , i have friends and colleagues who differ between organic , living world and inorganic world , the world .
and you can see , he &apos;s making it all out , and they &apos;re growing up , growing in a way .
we even have amazing life forms that we can manipulate .
and darwin himself asked a letter to a colleague who was likely to do life somewhere in a warm pond -- maybe not in scotland , maybe somewhere else .
what is life ? what is the fabric of life ?
and we can connect them and literally create thousands and thousands of really large molecules , in the same size as dna and proteins , but it &apos;s not carbon in terms .
we want to put them in the environment and we want them to get their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can create inorganic biology and make matter to evolve , then it will actually define life .
but there &apos;s another reason why i like this development , every single one to measure .
and these are high professional female interviewer who sit down an hour for a woman , and they ask their favorite questions .
i was sitting at friday at friday , and i was able to see how the mortality of the day was on the 6 acres of mali .
as you know , these economists love money , they want to always be more and more of it .
as you can see , it doesn &apos;t make any sense of a average to compute from a improvement that wasn &apos;t and fast progress .
but you don &apos;t talk about it as much .
in those were high , or very high , child mortality and families were very big , six to eight .
here &apos;s the recipe .
whatever is more value is worth money .
yeah , i went barefoot , until i was 12 .
and he told them , &quot; put the heart problem in question .

the most important -- it took about 10 years and 700 million dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth is enough to satisfy anybody needs , but not everybody &apos;s greed .

i went to high school .
when i was on the council of scientific industry research -- 40 labs -- if two of them were not talking to each other , i built teams .
they &apos;ve made and i &apos;ve got apps in the app app .
it &apos;s about perfect to perfect and something old to the 21st century .
it &apos;s still very hot , but not more kind of radioactive .
but there &apos;s not a lot of the pressure , and not so reactive , and not as reactive as it is that the world &apos;s favorite is not being left .
i &apos;m convinced that the reactor i designed here is can be a cutting-edge energy source that will be great scientific projects with electricity and i &apos;m really ready to do this .

then you will be considered false , as a computer , using traits that you don &apos;t have .
when i was small , i was very introverted and i &apos;d like to go for myself .
then it was just about catching up , and then they get to the end of the end .
so i made it concrete , because it doesn &apos;t matter .
this was the tool .
and for me , this is the most important thing . because i was a child , i wanted to convey my passion and love .
25 days : the sashimi and hands develop 36 days : the primitive bowl starts to train these weeks , the primitive bowl is going to train this weeks , the time the fetus is developing the fastest .
the complexity , this is in a single system , again , over any understanding of any understanding or any of the existing math .
because apparently , there &apos;s this kind of unstable animal company in the atmosphere of sun-like stars .
so what can you do with these spectra ?
i recently sent a colleague from berkeley , who was a colleague of berkeley , an email with a very interesting spectrum and said , &quot; can you look at this ? &quot;
there are two ways -- about the surface of the world , and the stars , and the particles , made and chemical elements in the universe , and bind to the universe .
because you can imagine everything is going to be more inclusive ?
now imagine a object , an incredible object , or something that we can &apos;t explain and we &apos;re just standing on and say , &quot; we &apos;re going to do it . physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
and if we see the oxygen , and oxygen , i think , we have the perfect e.t. .
i just said , &quot; really ? &quot; and he said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what i can tell you about is , she &apos;s universal ; we all have them .
i &apos;m slightly hooked on the street , but that &apos;s another talk .
this led to a little breakdown -- -- actually , that was rather like this .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is : no a design , no more inclusive . &quot;
what is the feeling vulnerable to be vulnerable ? &quot;
i &apos;m right , you don &apos;t have right . shut out .
we do that as if that , what we do , not the impact of other people .
people are making their meals in twitter , the igbo of their children on the iphone .
so if we think about using them to make systematic improvements , we also think about how they can be useful to our own , for our main and self-awareness .
and today i want to talk about one of the things we decided to do then , because we wanted to find a new access to health care .
so steven shares his story . but he &apos;s not alone .
here &apos;s why people pray .
i also love this kind of drug implant , also these were the only ones that were online and available .
and here we have a paper .
you don &apos;t have any of the data , you don &apos;t have any data that &apos;s running in science .
this is the curve over the world .
but my brother didn &apos;t go to him at the end .
if we went from here today to the ted level , we would be able to hit something that &apos;s 300 feet tall , 120 miles wide , 28 miles wide , and that weighs two horsepower .
to change the state , you only need two volts of a laser .
we said , &quot; can you build that ? &quot;
we can do better .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that comes from the so-called so-called the so-called the so-called .
and so , there are networks of the basic representations of complex systems .
and it also has implications on the medical system .
so we could put a team of dna in this way .
we see the emergence of the creation and the programs that are focused on it , and we &apos;re looking at our wired world from the point of complexity .
and the computer policy has a standard capacity with a little bit of capacity to have a nuclear capacity -- except you use expensive pumps and valves .
and we had 500 of these things .
no human security system .
so we were up on our own business .
and this graph doesn &apos;t even mean something that &apos;s invented data .
and my brain starts thinking very quickly about that that this is a kind of a representation of negative to positive in the world .
because this question is a prediction that our external world can predict our transportation systems . the truth is that i can only predict 10 percent of the world &apos;s most external , if i can get rid of all the external world .
and that &apos;s for two reasons , and it &apos;s kind of false to the ground .
we &apos;re moving people to write their own , a positive email of the internet , or to write someone in their social environment .
hard to say -- a more powerful , you understand -- my father was the most powerful man on the world .
and so i went . i went to mit .
they said , &quot; stop it . &quot;
they take a huge disk from cardboard .
he was the first digital media , in tokyo .
listen to this ? how cows ? this is in the morning 4 a.m.
so there are all these things to do , but most love i love to taste the world .
and i was taking this with passion .
your culture is not coming in schools , and i want to update you , how can we overcome this problem ?
that &apos;s why it &apos;s nervous because girls want to go to schools that there are no boys .
and in my life , in my life .
or mothers who were brought up with young ?
we need to change the posture of boys in elementary school .
and you have the impression that you believe that it would be okay .
let &apos;s see where this hypothesis is going .
is this a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we think that we can give these &quot; why &quot; questions about the fundamental principles of nature .
i &apos;m going to try and do that at the end , and i &apos;m also excited about whether it works .
and that was really a very important lesson for me , that you can &apos;t really act on an object .
we &apos;ve created a newspaper , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s connected by radio with my ipad , and this is a software that runs on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a computer tag , so i put it on a wooden , so that people in the glass are responding differently , if you &apos;re coming up .
i &apos;m going to turn into a middle-aged man in the middle of ages , and then in a old man .
at 110 extra things were allowed .
radio : what do you think of it ?
just fold the wings together and drive them on .
so i &apos;m going to ask you a different question .
and he took a royal scientist , with a giant , and the instruction had to be the instruction , and night , but with the secret instruction , not particularly good to make him very good .
because they found that the human behavior is more likely to be stronger .
yet we have to create a very clear thing to do , which is what you can create , and it &apos;s a lot of fair fair .
now , if we have all these tools to have , we have to just ask ourselves , and the thaler and the media and the media and the media , what we have these smart use .
they lead the new organizational system .
they give up little , more powerful , recyclable .
i felt passion , soul and heart , had left my body .
audience : no .
sb : no , no , no .
all around us , the other replicator is going to be able to find another replicator in this cultural culture .
they probably bought them .
imagine the world full of brains and more memes than you all have there .
we are the only ones and we are the only ones .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
that was dangerous , but hello .
they use us to make the resource out of the planet to produce more and more computers , and more amazing things that we &apos;re hearing here at ted .
and will we be able to record this third threat , how we went to the second and first ?
in collaboration with the -- that &apos;s the most powerful in haiti -- with the ministry of public health , with various different modes of communication , inspected , inspected , inspected more than 1,500 buildings .
it &apos;s not going to cost us anymore if we do it right . &quot;
and because i had burn on 70 percent of my body , it took all about one hour .
we also found that it would have been good to me in the other hand to recover me from the pain to recover from the pain .
and how bad would the punishment be if i would get caught ?
it wasn &apos;t that the most powerful people -- the ones that have more commandments -- had less cheated and that the less religious -- those who were going to remember almost no commandments -- would have dreamed of it .
so if you don &apos;t think of a few seconds of money , because you get a brand , you make a difference ?
it &apos;s like this .
i think that all these forces are very bad on the stock market .
but you can believe me . i work in the commercial business .
these are the most powerful ones i can show you today .
and suddenly amazon becomes the brand and reduces with the banks , defined how they want to spend money , what money is and what it means .
maybe that seems to be too big ?
i don &apos;t think i have to explain it to you , and last week , i had to explain it to my girl -- skeletons are structures that make sperm from an individual to another .
and i already knew that animals like the most violent here , or even most animals don &apos;t stabilize their tissue by breaking them across bones .
and that was that every skeleton that we found in nature had found about the same kind of water that we had in nature .
all of that i showed was really surprised about it .
a funny song about global warming , from jill sobule .
well , i guess i have to do that .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a piece ?
and the more powerful , and the most powerful , and the benefits of a great education .
the most profound thing about this is that , and ben became a very , very special one .
so , go on , what is the area of this character ?
i was forced to leave my home , the democratic republic of congo , where i was a little bit of time .
but remarkably , the united nations has been estimated the wealth of the country over 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not at the goal .
they have to be very inexpensive .
but could not be done for this angle of labor workers ?
they asked by the governments to support management management , and they have a lot of time in many cases .
but let &apos;s take a take our goal , and we have a new economic act to bring the base of the pyramid .
because they need a whole bunch of these little transactions to make their profits .
he liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful to lie in his own bed .
since the last night , sir , when sir freezes and the british society thought that that &apos;s why the sun seems to be .
so , what is fusion ? here &apos;s a little bit more transformative .
and this energy is it , it &apos;s the power of fusion .
so , a lot of a conventional power .
we need to make it a power station .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country , and it &apos;s also a great impact .
they wanted to do the most , the democracy , but they were from all countries who had been rejected in the last month , and they had been rejected by a professional state -- it was only four percent .
but the expectations of people left their future great .
so the question is , &quot; what does the male support for women &apos;s age is going to be ? &quot;
i promise you , she read the message .
nobody can listen to them , they just send them a text .
you could see the immediate effects of laws , or the one of the most powerful speech on a computer , and see what happens as a result .
the flight took 12 seconds and went over 35 inches .
this is unnatural for a rocket .
it weighs less than a computer .
the smallest of the smallest forces of the establishment of nature .
we can do it as individuals , and we can get hearing hearing .
we believe that somebody else , somebody , somebody &apos;s , somebody &apos;s family , somebody &apos;s going to solve more tools of this problem .
we didn &apos;t flew it in the pacific .
it took 10 full prototypes until we had something that was really flying .
and so there &apos;s this incredible elation , which is possible , and this is what this huge thing is , which means that .
and we think about our moral thinking .
and the director was pretty privileged and said to me that he thought i was mad . and he said to me , &quot; this place is a unit of surgery . these guys are heavy offenders .
it took several of these events to me , until i found what i should do .
when i started with this program four years ago , my favorite plan was a computer company to create a computer company .
and they look down for the ice of the wire , everything is so small and tiny .
i feel blessed and happy that i had the courage to give my quest to the courage of nyu , and in my country , where i &apos;m going to go back this incredible rides with this group of children , morocco and russia .
and how often would my self die before i understand that it hasn &apos;t existed from the beginning ?
and i was a really good dancer .
strangely , these findings don &apos;t really mean my low self-worth , this sense of otherness .
that was because i didn &apos;t have myself , which was in between .
imagine what kind of existence we could have , if we honor the inevitable death of self , the privilege of life , and the best thing comes next .
and this is a cafe on the sea in britain .
but instead of focused on this , we focused on how we work .
we also discovered that like a computer structure , and a kind of a structure of the structure , we would get a way of getting a structure .
but we found that seeds -- this really important project , but that , you know , that seeds -- that seeds are not going to be shown in the leading stations .
we worked with a computer company to develop a seed service of the seed seed , so even if you &apos;re visually visually impaired , it kind of kind of kind of kind of got a bit of a sense of landscape and soft , which is the piece of landscape you see here .
it &apos;s actually the first few pairs you &apos;re aware of , and the rest is just for postcards .
the book is called &quot; the blank slate , &quot; the popular idea , because the human mind is a blank slate , and all its structure of his socialization , culture , education and experience .
well , there &apos;s a number of political reasons for that , that they like to enjoy the people .
it &apos;s still not clear , by the way , whether these generalizations are fixed , but then the most prolific that would seem to be the case .
another one of the humanities and the most popular and in universities who are in many ways are in decline .
now , the other hot iron is the parenting .
and i think you can &apos;t say that to you .
i &apos;ll also call a skeptic , just like this , and you don &apos;t like it , but you don &apos;t confirm it .
there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no nonsense .
he says , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i &apos;m thinking right now . &quot;
oh , i live in a computer program -- that &apos;s strange .
so i asked myself what would happen if we challenge some of these online types of water .
right ?
it &apos;s like this -- we have explained the war , as a society , every one of us .
your iphone without the people who , the same skin , the same circuits , the same keyboard , and over and over again .
and then it became more powerful and pain and now it &apos;s a long time long .
and i said to brian , &quot; what did tony do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; so is it true that you &apos;re in this room ? &quot;
but how do you sit in a sane way ?
so , all of the things that tony came out of the street was discovered , according to his clinician , that he was crazy in this new way .
he was in a friendly practice and the most successful 30 percent of the workforce , and it turned out to be the american cities in the world .
and i added , &quot; i have a list of psychopathic features in my pocket .
and the jewelry are always the very profoundly aspects of the personality .
as it was , it was two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended .
in fact , the trend of the world was the rest of the world .
and as a result of this conversations , it &apos;s very , very difficult to say , i represent the true islam .
it may be that a great war between east and west was , and that it was in the framework democracy against communism .
and although the president , from the reasons , it &apos;s been made , very , very good to the reason that islam is not the enemy , is nonetheless , a natural impulse in the other side of the face .
when the treasure in 2000 , you saw the peak of the best of the best , the scientists who had the african penguins ever had to have been shown -- that at that point as endangered species .
on the day after our first , two of us were getting over the space of the room two , and space two more than 4,000 oiled penguins .
we still used this method in the treasure rescue .
and that &apos;s really important because african penguin was explaining to a year of endangered species .
on the front row of 32 , at the university of a mountain , a computer writer , in the front of a bus , and even before the police department , and even the police station .
people are open to the most open .
we launched this campaign -- very funny -- &quot; every egg counts . &quot;
this is not a second class of the second class .
these lessons came out of the course , abstract .
hillel turned on a leg and said , &quot; what you &apos;re doing is not what you &apos;re doing , that &apos;s the most powerful thing . the rest is the one .
now -- that &apos;s not the whole story .
and achilles takes a lot of body &apos;s body and hands it carefully on the father , and the two men see each other and see each other as divine .
this is actually what the cells look like to me in the biology and science , which looks at living cells in the microscope .
every grain of sand has size one millimeter .
you can see these kinds of things .
this picture was the beginning of the world &apos;s first .
we &apos;re all the same from the inside , believe me .
the walls are 700 inches of thick , solid concrete .
and that on the left is an x-ray .
it has human associations .
in x-ray , we see all the little pieces of wood in the corners .
i had to see the car in the middle of the room , for a little bit of a really simple task .
yes , they gave a request for a week for a week , and after this week , they just used them as a toilet .
science actually says that we &apos;re going to live forever .
no , i &apos;m a tooth .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you . goodbye .
where do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we &apos;re not going to agree .
not a professor and convicted , only two spirits , ready to be ready .
and then my life was fine .
everything i saw in creating was the right thing between the most successful and the most important ones .
would you be time to process information ?
we spent a lot of time with this , and we &apos;ve been hearing a billion dollars , and they &apos;re actually doing a billion of the things that he was doing , and what we found was , and what we found was shocking , but then more .
then there &apos;s dan etete .
we were horrified that these shell companies were rapidly taken their carbon dioxide , and the most important in london was very fond of the research company .
that &apos;s too complex and difficult to change it .
we &apos;re all going to die . we &apos;re all going to be old . we &apos;re going to leave all sick . people leave us .
there are places that you can &apos;t go to mind , you can &apos;t think of the worlds you can &apos;t inhabit anymore .
they have a more honest and freedom of that i believe is the foundation of a new computer system .
she made the decision to get no more juice or get a little bit of a sense of life , but your life is dedicated to that that this is not happening .
we &apos;re all refugees .
but you &apos;re going to get me to the head of this thing , and then it happens .
but this doesn &apos;t do it . &quot;
i miss michael .
he didn &apos;t find that , but he didn &apos;t get him to get him and said , &quot; you go into the rehab , or you &apos;re going to die . &quot;
ah ! we meet them , the secret beloved beloved . let &apos;s pull out .
if it &apos;s on the box , which is the most powerful , it &apos;s what it is .
the characteristics that the word is so often held in adults is so often in adults that we should eliminate this old word , if it comes to criticize behavior , to criticize behavior with the ones that are associated with the computer and irrational thinking .
if i was the ability to keep the ability to pay for the 10 percent of the interest that i &apos;ve been embarrassed to get on their last loan , i will cut their ability to get more money from me to get it back .
it &apos;s why we don &apos;t live in the dark times .
and the third are all the sound that we create people , the most powerful .
that &apos;s after selective logging .
there are many of the things that we have , in addition , from multiple strings , including the way animals teach us that , and they sing that i was going to be able to do for another time .
so that was extremely embarrassing .
and if you wonder how much that is , this is 16 kb .
so , 37 is our audience .
it &apos;s very impressive and a very beautiful concert .
and these are the themes that are actually at heart .
a generation that &apos;s going to make a lot more meaning from video games than the real world .
all of these are problems outside my photographic .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of video games are for our civilization .
finally ! finally ! that &apos;s it .
he would like it right .
so , you get fast from the simple to complex , if you do more . we like it .
and then they look at them , and that &apos;s the pain -- i thought that at least long time , until she explained to me , that &apos;s something that &apos;s going to be a little bit more friendly , so you think about it .
it &apos;s going to go to the other direction .
girl : there was a sphere and a computer ball because it &apos;s two completely different operations , and if you fall to it at the same time , maybe you fall out of the road .
but we could not train a thousand teachers to save our lives .
and it &apos;s a key one . &quot;
we &apos;re going to change ourselves as well as we have changed the world around us .
that &apos;s going to have incredible implications .
why do they do what they do ?
everybody would want the new version .
they &apos;re focused on very much .
they &apos;re actually going to be passionate about this moment .
i &apos;m going to get to the words that i &apos;m going to do in order to do .
&quot; well , yes , &quot; i said , &quot; strange , you ask that .
you &apos;re like , &quot; you don &apos;t need to do it again . &quot;
we saw ourselves , and i was grateful because she said , &quot; wow ! that &apos;s amazing . &quot;
the goal of the project is very simple .
this is completely personalized medicine in the world .
now the answer is a team of a team .
i work with the solar-powered and the most serious thing that some serious problems have been in the project , problems that shouldn &apos;t have been .
in medicine , there are so many people who don &apos;t want to change , not just if a computer engineer has the answer to the answer .
you can really find novel solutions that have been seen , and that &apos;s very quickly , and just fast .
yes , all right , your fellow , my life , because the time was all about beautiful , beautiful , the beautiful , the beautiful , the form of the form .
no , but it &apos;s true : the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i met the most popular .
and i didn &apos;t want to ask them to draw nice cartoons .
thank you .
so , &quot; our lonely earth &quot; brought me a lot of time to meet the audience .
we have a lot of time for the existence of the animals in this planet as they &apos;ve been here until we have the second microbial era .
his impact is the distribution of this very thin light distribution over the planet , and we had a very strong death of dinosaurs , death of these beautiful , the death of these beautiful , which is the death of this beautiful , and so much otherwise .
it &apos;s the supreme rail , the t. rex of his time .
they hate us .
this is when material comes from the deep of the earth and the surface , spread over the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m a little bit of a street from the coast , which is going to happen with me ?
they have a crash . they have two options : they &apos;re going to die , or they take the hydrogen sulfide and , say 75 percent of them will be saved , mentally .
so , the blessing and the marilyn .
some of you are countries who are the opinion that deregulation or even not a regulation of the best way is to restore investment .
the answer is simple : the chinese define these factories as chemical organizations , not as a result , and not as a test .
i don &apos;t know what we can do , but i can use my office at least to bring them together to develop a solution . &quot;
they need a safe environment .
now , now we have the impression that it &apos;s about the beginning of a new kind of regulation of the regulation of international tasks .
human rights is going to be a very simple question : can i get this person back ?
or the young to find the young , the fire has put the fire to see if you can change it . &quot;
okay , ready ? go .
i was fire and flame .
again , again , we saw the spoken word walls walls in the computer .
after the struggle , he shook his head , he &apos;s crying hair , and he said , &quot; you &apos;re a god . &apos; no , anderson , you &apos;re the god . &quot;
i travel a lot when i teach , and i don &apos;t always get to see how my students get their third step , but i had lucky luck to see her , that their journey was so evolved as they did .
my parents have called me sarah , which is a name name .
i want to talk to you about some ideas that have driven me to become a more nuanced .
when i saw that the war for everyone had such incredibly powerful consequences , and that the most powerful thing that was going to be a factor in conflict fiction was a photographer to be a photographer .
at the same time , south africa , after nelson mandela had been released from prison , the black population of liberation was a place of apartheid .
the next day i was looking at rwanda , and it was , when i was in the front of the hell in the hell .
after the fall of the fall of indonesia , i started studying the conditions of poverty in a country that was on the way to modernization .
a hospital of the physicians without borders in a refugee camp .
the most efficient thing is that the amount of soldiers that are going to survive that the proportion of the soldiers survive , in this war , is much higher than any other story in each other in our history .
so to make sure that as little as possible , we can have all these procedures that are going wrong , we have all these procedures in choice .
so you pick up like this .
but this is a broad , very difficult topic , so i had to cut myself .
the size of the population is the population -- there &apos;s big china , here &apos;s big india .
and at all eastern religions , the level of japan was the same level .
because death is going to be a child with another child .
and what is the reason in qatar ?
they have a great job .
all religions on the world are able to keep their values and adapt to these new world .
and then , as all of our generation , we lived in a hospital shop .
day eight .
in india , my favorite friends were the best friends and i went door to door with this same picture , to every single house in india . we did about a billion of them .
this is the most powerful thing .
i asked her -- it &apos;s all the things that you want -- and i asked them to ask them the questions that they want to give them .
i think we &apos;re doing a lot of gratitude and ron st. john , and i hope , ron is somewhere in the audience -- over there -- it &apos;s the founder of rockefeller .
larry brilliant : first of all , are you not mad because of the copyright prevalence of the most potent ?
have built a solar group , &quot; the climate group . &quot;
why should we have a positive impact on the world , the world , as a company ?
they save 85 percent of electricity with a led light bulb that they would have used with an old light bulb .
sometimes people think that 100 percent is very hard to be , and we had this conversation in business .
a more responsible one of the time is to be paid in seven or eight years .
from our 17,000 medical sector in ikea , 47 percent women , but that &apos;s not enough and we want to close this gap and we want to close this gap to the high management consequences .
there was a equation in my family , about this : if you &apos;re intelligent , you &apos;re not spiritual .
this is &quot; he said , &quot; it &apos;s the shining structure of reality .
somebody whose attitude you interpret or the steam is to break out the signal from the ears .
the end of our computer system , we realized the openness of the other .
as i would go back to bangalore , and often to become active discussions of my friends , where we discussed different themes , while they were covering the very hard news , where a drink is often paid more than what they paid their 14 years old .
he &apos;s looking for forgiveness , and he says he wants to make a better life of his child &apos;s child .
this pakistani convention seemed to be pretty happy , and it had no deaths to deny , even though they were killed dozens of water in liberia .
and how are we responsible for that ?
it &apos;s frightening -- not ? -- that the media of the world is doing such a bad job that a small group of activists in the position is to publish more of this kind of information than the rest of the press .
j yeah . this was the front page in the guardian and it was going to print around kenya around kenya , in the most violent and south african press .
j the impact on people who worked on it were expensive .
and there &apos;s a lot of information .
i would care about it , just because of what we &apos;ve heard -- i &apos;m curious about the opinion of ted audience .
and we said , &quot; oh , tell us more .
so you have to be careful with the term hackers .
and just one month ago , it was passed all of the most popular parliament in parliament .
and from all these numbers , i start with only two or three variables .
this piece here can be read very differently , depending on where you &apos;re going to be doing it .
first , i read about a complaint about a drawing in a computer , and the one that was born between the most responsible medicine for the responsible medicine and seven .
so , according to this research , the best thing is to make it a chicken , not too short in the way , but not too long in it , until it gets black , and a randomized group of plastic juice , brown sugar or water .
and then the next summer i worked under dr. dunlap &apos;s license on the back line , texas .
and this realization is incredibly for efficiency of chemotherapy , perhaps many different types of cancer .
for example , volatile organic compounds are chemical pollutants that are in our schools , and found and found on the workplace .
because all these solutions are , of course , they &apos;re sustainable and they &apos;re more sustainable -- they &apos;re more nuanced for our generation and for the following generations .
and immediately , a voice called , &quot; kangaroo ! &quot;
after the conference , after my talk , people came to me , men and women .
hard !
a prosthetic is not more for the need , a lack of protected .
we &apos;re all different from different perspectives .
i was in the way that beijing was going to be around the olympic olympics .
about 80 percent of these twin people are young people .
and they &apos;re most unemployment , the most of the time , the banks of the banks , the domestic , the most powerful of the bank , the north of europe and america , the products they produce , exposed to them .
they have a kind of a tool that you can put on a piece of chicken or fish , and it looks like beef .
people think about this question : will we continue to keep our environment further on a greater gross victim ?
there &apos;s nothing up there , but the conditions were ideal for the winter in the world .
now , the series was not even out of the line , so they &apos;re the first one that you get to see .
mars &apos;s similar to the earth as the earth seems to be as much as the earth &apos;s earth .
sousa had scared that we &apos;re losing the possibility of losing machines , &quot; you would lose the machines . &quot;
but much more importantly , that bmi is used to use the footprint of the new plastic system that they &apos;re going to take free to their customers , and then in 1940 , in 1940 , in the zoo of the election , when they were screaming with a double truck , the majority of the train was made of bmi .
and i ...
for the balance of that i &apos;m trying to do , i &apos;m trying to take a good liberal of course , of course , to ask a good thing about government , and a mistake , right ?
this realization is extraordinarily intimidating , extremely intimidating .
okay , i &apos;m not going to give you clear , but i just noticed that the person on the right is a liar next to you .
&quot; honey , you don &apos;t see it in it , no . &quot;
another study showed that strangers are three times in the first 10 minutes of their being .
here &apos;s matthieu with her kitten .
i &apos;ll tell you again .
and you &apos;re supposed to look a liar in the eyes .
we say , &quot; yes , as we shake the head .
the science has been very much more pressing on daylight .
look at exactly the same thing and you &apos;ll see the next video in the next video .
in this such much more powerful world , it can be sense for us to be a little bit more subtle in terms of our moral rules .
and that &apos;s not true , right ?
you know , we often think that language is the world that we live in , but that &apos;s not true .
so what &apos;s going on as a computer designer , if not tragic joke about harry seems , acting as ethnic media .
six months after any explanation , no one explanation , they let me free .
that &apos;s what makes me trouble .
when i was 10 , i read james &apos;s country , and i was broken in this book .
i proposed a new song .
so i took a little time to study coke .
and in the remote areas of africa , it &apos;s hard to find a good road .
how do you have incentive based on the effects that you have in these remote villages ?
i don &apos;t mean that as pleasant as &quot; the car &apos;s worth of life . &quot;
they &apos;re going to be cut on it .
much more people would have been gifted .
today i &apos;m going to tell you two things . first of all , what we &apos;ve lost , and second , how we raise it .
here you can see the largest part of the living of the florida in the florida .
if there &apos;s no fishing fishing , because it &apos;s protected , or starving , then it &apos;s great .
after a few years , after five to seven years , the fish come back , food , food , and then the algae grow again .
you can see the border of the water , because there are all the boats back there .
if it &apos;s so good , if it &apos;s so simple , how much is it ?
so the transportation of the sea is the largest and the oceans to a sink for government and environmental institutions , and that &apos;s not acceptable .
in the coral reefs , we found that the pyramid is the pyramid to the bottom of the world , where five lions come to a water program .
okay , enric , thank you for having a part of your spiritual experience . thank you .
it &apos;s been proven as the longest creature in the ocean .
they come to the submersible -- they come to the window and look at the window .
and in other ways , we &apos;re trying to deal with our partners at woods hole , these virtual world -- this is the world , this unexplored area -- to get to the lab .
bl : these worms don &apos;t have a dent . they don &apos;t have mouth .
what we &apos;ve seen was from the pacific .
we &apos;re going to try to show you the pacific in the pacific .
these worms grow several inches in the week !
the concept of the world &apos;s concept is that it &apos;s unacceptable .
and the rest one percent is very keen to go to the formula that you can apply in the situation .
they also have mathematical structure , which is the kind of magnetic structure , measurements , measurements , points , axes , etc .
the students have to create these things . they have to make them .
and the best , or one of the best parts , is that we don &apos;t get the answer from the end of the ocean .
what &apos;s probably happened with the small hadron collider ?
you can find the fastest growing young population around the world .
it &apos;s a lot of the state . there &apos;s no government schools in the slums .
this is a computer that was installed at the entrance of a world-changing social collaborator , a world-changing entrepreneur named sugata mitra , who showed the most popular experiments that kids could learn under certain conditions , with help of a computer .
well , the key is motivation , and that &apos;s in two ways .
this is a school in a van on a construction site that &apos;s growing the fastest city of asia .
they should turn it into a mcdonald &apos;s mcdonald &apos;s .
there are formal patterns , schools , private groups , hospitals , where innovation can occur , and informal environments , communities , families , social networks .
every child to age 15 , who wants to have a place in school , will be able to get a place .
and while i look at it , this scene comes to tears , and i &apos;ve been doing my last 25 years with me .
there &apos;s a few parents of teenagers , and we have to cook for them -- and they &apos;re going to go to each night for two , three or four , four or four in the way . it &apos;s ridiculous .
he &apos;s going to go around and gradually pay everything !
these gay ones , people like me , want to be treated as full citizens , and it &apos;s written directly before our nose .
there &apos;s people afraid to have their job , so they don &apos;t show who they are , here at home , and it &apos;s not just about north carolina ; it &apos;s not just about the north carolina .
think about it .
and i got scared .
about three years ago , i read a paper in the new york times .
who were my grandparents ?
it helps us become what we could have .
that &apos;s how evolution works .
and in fact , here &apos;s this insect .
i just smell one of the people .
it &apos;s not just drifting on 43 to 44 degrees c for about two days , but hold a constant temperature .
but contrast to about this . it &apos;s going to be out of the background .
here the americans put the russians , and yes , it was -- actually -- a game .
she started telling me , and all parents here will be able to recognize the most powerful .
i have a reductionist history .
our lives will be determined by data , and the presentation of this data is to create fantastic interfaces , which can tell great stories .
i also got a look at the different design set , because you can pick what you &apos;re going to take out of the data .
it &apos;s a man &apos;s dream , which is in the box , controlling this kind of thing .
a little bit of about 11 sheep an hour , which is a little bit of 68 cents .
in the reason , you can -- what you see on the left is the most powerful , and you see the frame of the frame , and you can see the frame of the frame of 16 people who had no idea what they do .
bicycle bell : bike , a portable -- aaron , aaron -- and we took all these pieces and the data that they took to another mechanical turk please .
but we knew that we needed the right person to put us out the right person to put us behind it , and we could build something .
and under all the individual frames , people put in the project .
thank you .
so i made rows of images , cut , and put them in the back of the room .
so , a unprepared consequence of that is that you just see one part of his image , and that leads to a very free building .
and sometimes i have an emotional response to news , like the earthquake in haiti in 2010 .
then i went 50 miles , then 60 miles .
it &apos;s like the different layers of the ones we &apos;re doing , and what we &apos;re presenting is the world as our identity .
another species of research is in a public library in san jose , california .
so each building has its own personality .
it may be easier than ever before , to save a good way to save a good .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re particularly materialistic .
it &apos;s just too weird .
you know , in middle ages , in england , if you met somebody who was very poor , you called this &quot; unhappy &quot; . literally , somebody who &apos;s lucky , the fate , was a computer company .
and it &apos;s going to do the youngest court with angels and the toughness , and the sky will open up .
i told them the action of michelangelo &apos;s action .
what i think i really talked about is , really , success and failure .
we should make sure that we are really the creator of our own ambition .
alain de botton : a transformative , gentler
if you train for this sport , you don &apos;t smile .
you know , you &apos;re going to go through with the light glasses , and you swim 60 trains per minute , so you &apos;re never really on something that you &apos;re looking at .
they &apos;re enriched in the liquid .
my breath is down to three main points , the minute .
and i &apos;m worried about that , i didn &apos;t make it .
i swam with this thing .
it &apos;s the only thing that i &apos;m interested in .
that &apos;s already what we have today .
the gateway can be a smartphone , or it could be a particularly valid portal , like many of these things , which are special , because they &apos;re not so well integrated .
many of you have the phillips direct life .
this is a very important part of our life . we should sleep a third of our lives .
ok . now let &apos;s go from sleep to disease .
so we can change medicine in the world &apos;s age , in all ages , of groups or to the seniors , to the seniors ; the entire spectrum of the disease -- i hope i &apos;ve got to make a sense of it -- around the globe .
so , i hope i &apos;ve convinced you -- the effects on the top of the world are enormous and the effects on disease , and the effects of disease are also amazing in all of these different diseases and more .
how do we create robust societies ? longevity .
and in the novel , a certain so-called a particular detector , and he says , maybe it &apos;s not the best way , and it &apos;s destroyed the whole system .
and so no one &apos;s going to be there .
and it &apos;s a great thing .
so , gradually , it should be faster .
you might ask yourself how we do these kinds of things .
our only cookbook is the world &apos;s only cookbook in the room .
this is the finished hamburger .
a talk about surgical robots is always a talk about surgery .
and surgeons were more business than doctors .
but ultimately , the buick was also the emperor .
they had to give up their intuitive movements with the instruments .
i told you about the big , complicated robot .
and as you can see , it comes out to do something useful to do that , that &apos;s not that much of the time .
and we don &apos;t even have to be constrained by these kinds of things .
we &apos;re here to talk about accidents .
but we had a problem .
okay , now , it was partly my fault .
we haven &apos;t just shown that bacteria can be the solution for plastic waste , but that the openness of the vaccine is allowing to be available to the more powerful discoveries and the risks of risks .
the film we &apos;re going to see is made for the most powerful in new york .
i &apos;m not there .
it continued . they always tried to make things better .
they don &apos;t say , &quot; our style are curves . let &apos;s make the house curved . &quot;
i think in my family , we had a lot of happiness , because we &apos;ve learned backwards .
wake up , very good .
ed : and then a row is really a historical site , and there &apos;s the most historic story in paris , where the message has taken the first place .
see this chair ? the orange ? this is the most exciting chair . in 1940 .
because it &apos;s part of where we want to go .
it was a full of outrage full of outrage ; they were full of speculation ; they were a little bit more friendly information .
one of them is known : the population explosion . the population of population has two to seven billion people in the last 50 years .
brent lawson : to be here .
you see the lines check , as the population explosion is happening .
before i talk about the cost , i have to clear that i have to clear that i have to clear that i have to clear that i have to clear that i have to clear that i &apos;m very clear .
so , in fact , liberation looks like this .
but only for recently , we can , thanks to a technical progression , now the quantum quantum theory and quantum locking .
first of all , some strands of magnetic field are trapped inside , but the superconductor doesn &apos;t like it , because they &apos;re moving their movements , and so the most cosmopolitan .
and i can also extend this round of magnet , of course , to make a separate track .
and it was inspired by douglas adams , the situation from &quot; pass through the galaxy . &quot;
because of course , they don &apos;t explain how to do it , if you want to do it yourself and not have a throwaway player .
but even though they were not convinced they said , &quot; okay , we call back . &quot;
so , the computer &apos;s : yeah , i have .
so some of you will say , &quot; what will happen when moore &apos;s law rolls up to its borders ? &quot;
today you can buy half a billion billion , and you &apos;re even better , because you &apos;re faster .
but where are we going to get the software ?
larry page has been a passionate talk to our ted team that he was doing for the most powerful challenges of humanity .
they wanted to catch the fish .
that may be insignificant , but it &apos;s incredibly scary to hear many rumors that another one is larger than the last to get exactly 13 in the last to get 13 in the last day or maybe ...
so the tsunami can be seen as a kind of evolutionary moment , a moment where the blogosphere was grown in .
probably it &apos;s in three to five percent of the number of prevents prevents in the glass , and it would be better than the estimate of 90 to 95 percent of them .
somebody has linked something , so they link others , etc . , etc .
he finished his head of his , and i &apos;m waiting for a 300 pounds of heavy , and he &apos;s going to be a long bit of a long piece of paper with a long plans , but he says , &quot; that &apos;s all i want to do . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you now 30 seconds of film , and i &apos;m going to show you the thing about the skin .
this habitat is covered more than all the other habitats together .
many of us , i &apos;m locked in , thinking that the exploitation of the oceans are only in the last 50 or maybe 100 years .
these about a cable connected vehicles are our eyes and hands for the work on the sea floor .
so there &apos;s a barcode on this product that &apos;s telling the computer exactly what the product is .
but i want to share with you some of my favorite discoveries of the census .
we don &apos;t know why they do that , we don &apos;t know .
this graph is based on a brand novel article that will appear in the journal of biology .
but that &apos;s not all that .
as an architect , i &apos;m so eager to confront .
mitchell joachim : don &apos;t build a house , grow it !
i think that &apos;s very interesting , and i really learned , because what you &apos;ve heard in the last few days is that the sense of going to the different directions : directions , which are specific and unique for problems .
well , we all think that the most obvious thing that was obvious is that it was a huge romantic poet , many of us forget that he &apos;s written some wonderful earrings , and the most famous essay is a word called poetry .
i &apos;m going to read you that .
and at a certain time of his life , they &apos;re going to go on rocks .
but let me show you the latest robotic engineering .
if you used to , before the digital radio , the drill and &quot; dig &quot; on the phone , that was that noise .
the basic idea of the world &apos;s idea is that you have two sources of information that you have to get out of the conclusions .
that means i have to make predictions about the future .
now , there &apos;s a very clear example of where a lot of me feel a lot different , when it was made by another person .
and in the meantime , i got two daughters .
so they didn &apos;t know the rules , they didn &apos;t know the other person .
if these dots were cars on a surface of a computer , they would have no idea what &apos;s going on .
we &apos;ve shown that we can explain a big part of the data -- people actually plan their movements to be able to minimize the negative consequences of noise .
this is from the ocean national national city .
mars has the largest largest system of the solar system , the solar system .
this is my favorite thing . it was just taken a few weeks ago .
the oldest stone on earth is only 3.6 billion .
and the result of our meeting was a very , very talkative called ares .
we fold it , and we transport it in a spacecraft .
this is about the surface of the sea , oregon .
i think there &apos;s a way to look at this , and i think , &quot; eight to 12 . &quot;
and there was a guy who sold these weapons for lego , because lego -- the most of the time -- no , they &apos;re not on guns .
and then there are some examples of the stuff that are real sculptures .
i have to tell you , for me , this night was all changed .
perhaps most importantly , the impact on other companies is enormous .
in fact , politics is the dominant thing of the world .
in brazil , there are now 1,600 , whereas the u.s. only have 700 , and the u.s. two in california is two in california , and within three years , the percentage of the four percent on 85 percent is up to 85 percent .
it &apos;s not a big deal . biofuels are a really big thing .
scientists tell us -- and these are just estimates -- that we have to get out of greenhouse gases in half , and so fast as possible .
i can &apos;t wait to do what we &apos;re talking about to tedsters .
there are always fewer people who are available to be consumed , and then you get this kind of thing to the curve and you get this classic , and you get this classic curve curve .
b is on the edge of the network .
and that &apos;s happening to each other .
the red dots are going to be the most powerful , and the yellow dots are going to be friends of people with flu .
would you get immunity to the pop-up ?
and there are , i think , three ways to be used to this kind of data data .
the building was in construction to collapse of the economy , and death of the back of the 1990s , and death of the &apos; 90s .
and even though it seems to be a completely chaotic place , if you see it from top , there seems to be a whole web of the information and channels that connect every single house .
in this tradition , the future bride is all all their possessions that will bring them to their new husband .
what a place like the dragline david particularly is really remarkable , is this kind of environmental engineering , where people have a foundation that they can use to use .
we can only ask : &quot; how do the most powerful of the music show ? &quot; and i immediately understand what else we want .
it has replaced the workers through technology .
you can see a couple of symbols on the left , which show what &apos;s going on with his right arm .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re always getting older .
or even if we &apos;re going to get a lot older , our cars can go to the way we go to people .
they were gone in a moment .
it &apos;s always been more obvious that we can &apos;t win .
the two specialists behind the curtain will help me bring the result on the screen .
one of the journalists asked , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
the evangelical geeks are the same as jewish biofuels .
i think there are some reason , actually , a lot of reasons , but here &apos;s just a few of us in the short term .
he was attracted by the flames , he sells them , he was like a baby , a little bit of a sudden .
let me go door to the door of the international community , and see if somebody gives the police or troops for those .
but for sergio , it was too late .
he saw her .
ce power : a complicated hero
this means jobs and possibilities all along the way .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about the free of food , because this year , last year , and 2008 , during the most successful , and in 2008 , there &apos;s enough food for every single month .
and i go into these stores when you &apos;re there , more importantly in the fields to see what you can get , and i &apos;m going to find you not to get food .
we see changes of participation in schools .
i want to talk about something that i call digital food .
and what i found is that instead of investing in subsidies and other things , invest in a school program .
thank you .
we could do the same thing in cancer .
they &apos;re not going to go longer to a football system .
it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a very , very clear device , not because it shows me how many of the things i do every day , but because it monitors 24 hours , which i do .
it &apos;s never been shown .
the productivity of these magnets is so big that we can see with this technology a single neutron .
you don &apos;t have to shrink the tumor .
if the magnet is big enough , and their resolution high enough , they can actually get all the proteins in the body , and start to understand the individual system .
most of us find it comforting , and interestingly , 12 vibrations per minute of a sleeping person .
for example , if i put this -- more than a few seconds , they would be able to feel uncomfortable ; they would feel uncomfortable than a few minutes , and they would walk out the hall in 2d .
that &apos;s what all of you have noticed . and that &apos;s the tune that is the most common to hearing in the world .
and i was standing there with two very good friends of mine , richard weavers and kevin .
as we cross miles and miles from the north of the mountain -- frozen water , the most powerful .
so , as i &apos;m here today , i &apos;m talking about the most of about five years .
10 kilometers before the coast and in the south of the coast , and in the south of the city .
the oceans , in climate and weather , they hold the temperature stable and shapes the chemistry of the world .
there are easy ...
this is the result when you don &apos;t know that there are boundaries for what we can take the oceans .
for example , in the last three years , the u.s. is highly classified square square miles than a computer economy .
we need to come around , new technologies to exploration the ocean .
a lot of my early career i wanted to figure out how the wings of the insects generate enough force to keep themselves in the air .
let &apos;s study this idea of simplicity .
this is a beautiful picture of visual design of a mouse from a lab from jeff kamen , and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk .
they &apos;re making a laser , a little bit of a behavior , and another one of the other things that has a different set of information and patterns and you can think that this works in a very complicated system .
our mission is to build a more powerful and realistic computer model of the human brain .
he &apos;s home and drinking tea .
if you look closer to the neocortex , you &apos;re going to see that it &apos;s from louder components , and it &apos;s a lot of little components , and you &apos;re going to have a computer , like in a computer .
how many of the basic parts of a tree is there ? where are they building ?
we can look at the tissue . and we can change neurons .
we can upload all these neurons , every single one in its own state , it activate , and watch what happens .
so , the most powerful thing that the secrets of the brain can be solved is that the secrets of the brain can be solved , mental illness , perceptions : they &apos;re made of neurons and electrical signals , and he &apos;s planning to do it with a supercomputer that &apos;s going to be able to detect the brain with a vegetable .
it would be two or three thousand bombs necessary .
the air force began to build smaller models , and started this .
this is what nasa did to get a more powerful , which would fly to mars .
i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about the behavior of the brain .
it &apos;s a fantastic time writing . because there &apos;s so much resonance that you can get from people .
the bottom ? yellow .
if you ask people that question , they usually think that it has something to do with culture .
the countries on the right , those who give a lot of a lot , have a slightly different form .
i &apos;ll give you another example of this .
but then to get back to a little bit more complex , once again .
online , for 59 dollars .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we don &apos;t really know our biases .
in fact , in medical , this is our view .
and radio waves are limited .
it &apos;s just to use infrared -- you can only use the way to get the eyes down .
their intensity can be highly exploited , and it can be very quickly turned off .
they &apos;re critical .
but just by the way .
cars have a little bit of time and the other , and they can communicate with each other and communicate through the surface of the traffic lights with the cars and so on .
dna is what &apos;s mean , all life is mean .
because it &apos;s actually not so many data .
you have the genome system , and you have a customized medicine that &apos;s better than the way that you have today -- it has no side effects .
it &apos;s really easy -- just just just just -- just just just -- just just , we &apos;ve got it completely compatible .
we &apos;re not running as small organisms alone on the world , but they &apos;re part of a big ecosystem .
the consequences can be bad -- if we kill ourselves or the earth -- but that &apos;s just the consequence of one of us being made of errors .
now i &apos;m mostly here because there &apos;s a kind of dig in the dog room in the moment where we have a person who thinks that you &apos;re cutting a dog , first of all , by making a dog , human rules .
they &apos;re just like &quot; the &quot; aw , &quot; and therefore , they &apos;re going to beat .
no , we &apos;re doing &quot; puppy , sit . &quot; -- boom , he can try to do it for six to 10 .
these are the golden design systems .
and i would say , if you don &apos;t need it , you should not be it .
not only with the puppy , but also with the rest of the family .
these are the very simple ones .
their children are just to train .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , and this windmill -- does it work ?
wk : yeah . i still think working with energy .
because even though i used scientific terms in songs , sometimes it &apos;s very hard to make them sound .
and even less , if it &apos;s accompanied by the most violent and the water , like in my case .
one is a white flash of light .
64 with 75 multiply .
let &apos;s look at the third question .
the desert is expanding a mile or two per year .
the homo erectus had the same tool over 30 generations ago .
you can teach them in the lab , practice a little bit of trade-offs , and there &apos;s actually a more , in fact , a little bit of a different animal in other animals , but the exchange of an object has never happened to another .
it &apos;s the wealth that &apos;s in the mind , and the pleasure of your own needs , time .
we &apos;ve achieved this as a species .
but there &apos;s no evidence for that .
and when people started doing things like this far , the things that had been a relationship was that a exchange between groups existed .
but who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
but i &apos;m also because of the connections that people are taking , and the way that we have never been there is the possibility of ideas , to meet and mate . i &apos;m also sure that technology is going to continue to expand and improve the standards of the standards .
this is as high as a building building , and i &apos;ve been putting the liberty as compared to the hypothesis .
but we don &apos;t talk about it , we don &apos;t take it seriously .
they &apos;re just gone , these feelings , they &apos;re gone .
if we think about the most powerful detection detection , the fast development is the problem because how can we discover things that change all the time ?
i &apos;ve talked about that -- you know this situation , if you don &apos;t get diagnosis in the hospital ?
what about real people ?
we sequenced a part of their viruses ; it &apos;s new , so far , the wild rhinoviruses .
after 10 more days with a fever , she came back -- still fever -- she has a little bit of oxygen -- little oxygen in your lungs .
it wasn &apos;t even sequenced very often .
it &apos;s a classic retrovirus , but it &apos;s completely new . nobody ever saw it before .
a huge battery could be that .
instead , we &apos;re trying to do something that fits to the ted system of the brain .
i brought a solar tag with low density up to dense density , a high density of radiation , and a molten salt in between .
but david is young and clever and he wants to make a more powerful , and so he builds up -- he &apos;s building the first liquid metal metal system .
so what have we learned from all of this ?
this video was taken in the back of the coast , six kilometers before the coast of the coast of ice , about 20 feet below the surface .
and quickly , we realized that our garage wasn &apos;t big enough for this growing project .
i started to look at maria &apos;s work and their methods and how they found these little things and how important they found that children are doing things and they don &apos;t teach them to be open to open up .
evolution is often seen as this one , which we &apos;ve chosen , but it actually represents a big number of possibilities .
i &apos;m going to skip this up to the stage of space space .
our cities are at risk , because many of them are standing in the coast .
there are stars and so forth .
so if we think about the behavior of the brain or body language , how it &apos;s called the social scientists , it turns out to be language . we think about communication .
this expression , as a pride , was also seen by jessica tracy , and she showed that the short-term people and birth of birth to blind people , they do , do this when they win a football system .
so i thought about it . you get to these people and you see how they &apos;re involved in it , and you could do it , to pretend it , to pretend it , and then you would engage more ?
what happens to a nuclear park , what happens when you &apos;re going to the stage of stage ? how do you get the following little manipulation of this tiny little bit ?
this is happening in the lab . the little exercise , for only one few minutes , where you can actually use this ? that &apos;s what we really care about .
these things . people like this , i think , are the true ones . they &apos;re showing themselves .
she was completely depressed and she said , &quot; i don &apos;t have to look for this . &quot;
they need your body , privacy and two minutes . it can affect the other way in the big scale .
and the way that we go to get a lot of time to get to your own favorite process , and the most powerful , you get an ant , you get a blade of the brain , and you go up to a blade of grass as a jeep .
and you have to have a kind of a kind of a conceptual solution , you have to have a answer .
so it &apos;s like i think richard and i care about that these ideas are not being abused .
and of course , they &apos;re extinct in the same way .
but under all these ideas that are defined by our technology , we &apos;re going to be spreading in the whole world , many toxic ideas .
and as we should not try to eliminate viruses here , they &apos;re not going to try to destroy them .
and in my game , that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing .
we put some ideas on the legs , we went to international tour .
i know you &apos;ll say , &quot; t is not in music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
nobody hears each other . nobody &apos;s familiar with the other .
you &apos;ll see the orchestra in a kind of a bioluminescent fashion company .
i don &apos;t want to have that , that shouldn &apos;t have happened , but that we need to be better if it &apos;s about answering the questions that you have to consider when you think about the consequences and the reactions .
they work in government . they &apos;re the driver .
five dollars can save life .
she deserves about two dollars a day , building a little bit of a time , and she &apos;s explaining that you &apos;re not getting married even children before these things are done .
finally , from despair , they went and they went to a kind of old woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , if you &apos;re angry , you &apos;ll be the best talk you &apos;re ever going to regret .
okay , the big majority of us .
his message was basically unity , the connectedness of everything and the unity of everything . and his fundamental value was respect , was kindness to strangers .
who fights , while he &apos;s going ?
they start to go , in israel and palestine , in jordan , in jordan , in syria .
and so more and more of the time , and since recently she has a income to support their family .
just go to somebody with another culture , from another country , with another ethnicity , which is kind of different and connected to it , listen to him . listen to him .
i start where the story started , 1985 in 1985 .
now , before you get out of the street , who had the ability to make a shower ?
you see here -- 35 percent of this much famous houses , where 50,000 indigenous people live , 35 percent of the houses had a working shower .
21 percent of what we &apos;re fixing are follow by the user &apos;s devices , things that were actually wrong .
we did it . he was making a joke .
we found out later that in this region , failure is the cause of disease and death .
one thing is that in the context of everything we &apos;ve done , the middle of the world &apos;s favorite writers said , &quot; how slavery and apartheid is not the intuitive thing to do here . she &apos;s the work of people , it &apos;s the work of people , it &apos;s the work of people .
i don &apos;t mean it if you call me a more powerful . it &apos;s really not .
it sounds really confident to say that from here , but if you try to use it , it &apos;s amazing .
with this statement , i &apos;m going to ask you to be able to leave the kids in the way that children should not leave their community to live in a better way .
this is the youngest of conventional labor in america with our family technology .
this is a picture of the bronx of the bronx , who had the children in his house , not in prison , so they felt like they felt .
we gave a little back .
if you &apos;re large kids with small amounts of music , they &apos;re the big thick man in the middle , which is cool , and they create these responsibility under the most violent , which is incredibly .
now , you might wonder about these kids .
hold kids away from these stores .
stephen ritz : a teacher who was south bronx
secondly , i bet that even you see the difference here as a 30-year view here , right now , the amount of the carbon dioxide line .
to go to 10 : in 1967 , the pig was a heart attack .
people with migraine headaches who have an aura , have a band with nervous neurons -- here in red -- that &apos;s three to five millimeters a minute to the ted day .
the problem is that 30 million americans have migraine migraine , and we need a more powerful one . i think we have now .
my first wish is that the most violent thing for epilepsy , the most powerful , for the most violent , for the treatment of the other , is used to be used for other people &apos;s treatment .
lawyers are taking cases of the hope in the hope of the hopes of fats , which are the poor patients who have the poor patients of pity .
a year ago , four of the five of the world &apos;s population was about five of the world &apos;s favorite , which is , by swahili , &quot; the &quot; jazz &quot; project , also .
how do you know what &apos;s really important about this ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i &apos;ve got it first to get it to get it here .
these people below the barrier , i call the most powerful , because they &apos;re really going to get out of the process , to share with the world .
they have been using a platform to use a platform to develop their materials and the research that we teach in 84 countries around the world .
yes , books that are sold by 100 or 1,000 spending in the year .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that it &apos;s all like , right ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so that &apos;s not very hard .
the days of the world &apos;s population is , when people say , &quot; well , we &apos;d like to have three or a half of them in our country to see how this works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a rocket project . it &apos;s an education project .
you can use a couple of thousand children with two of them .
so it &apos;s like an electronic book .
everybody says that &apos;s a $ 100 laptop that you can &apos;t do .
and that &apos;s the launch .
they &apos;re click around things and stare at screens . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no . there &apos;s still better opportunity . &quot;
we &apos;re all playing the lucy of lucy on a big post line , and we can &apos;t keep up with the data .
thank you .
i think most people think that a pregnant mother , as well as their child , is dominated by their child .
that &apos;s not possible . it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s going to be good . you will live .
first , the most important to prevent .
two years ago , one of the mentor mothers came to me and told me a story .
how do you build a better health system ?
the most important thing is , how simple is the system .
if you look at the volume of gray substance in the age of four to 22 years , she takes in childhood , which shows this graph . it &apos;s going to be in the early adolescence .
the idea that your father in the public was singing , so she was going to be able to get away .
this is the most powerful thing we built together .
after the first year , it was invited by the sunrise at usc , in austria to install it in his lobby and i &apos;m happy to say that there was a day online , 24 hours a day , for almost nine years .
but in the night , while we were talking about the tele-actor , i asked the tele-actor how the most violent they would have chosen to kiss sam .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place where my family has been working on four generations in the prison lab .
honestly , i have no idea what it has with shepherd , but they &apos;re incredibly reactive .
the first thing you realize in the computer is the terrible force of the brain .
he jumps it up to my leg , picks me up , bring me up to a vehicle , and i can bring me to a doctor .
it was a depression in the ground .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about them . &quot;
we have calculated that 200 years the end of our direct energy system is the world .
it &apos;s so simple , technology as a metaphor for the memory , but our brains are not perfect , like technology .
it &apos;s the most powerful of my favorite story .
i &apos;d like to think -- thank you .
and i can assure you , corn is in everything .
you should know that in every community , the number of the internet is already increasing .
i &apos;ve led three main classes in antarctica .
but tell me where they are and what country they are . &quot;
we also explored the surface of the islands -- a very important tool for birds , one of the most important things in the pacific .
and we are as the rest of the world , a problem .
he coined the phrase &quot; reverse fishing license . &quot;
of course , the most open and open sea was going to be the open sea , but the most open , which is to look at everybody , was in trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific , with huge amounts of glass and huge amounts of water .
now there &apos;s a lot of time , immediate , automated , automated , for free , in the smartphone .
it &apos;s an endless debate , and there &apos;s no conclusions , no single answer to it , but if you &apos;re a giant nerd like i &apos;m , you say , &quot; well , what &apos;s the data ? &quot;
instead , he &apos;s been documenting very carefully what happens whenever technology is first in a environment and in a community .
so there &apos;s , of course , two different possibilities .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a yves crossing .
i mean , it was at least how happy it was .
now , there was a question of , of course , that i was going to be in mind for a while , well , i can do more of the things that i love to do in design , and less of those who i don &apos;t like to do ?
and here it is from the front on the front .
they &apos;re a terrible situation without the outside .
they will fit in hospitals .
so , for example , as a 15-year-old , i was considered an extraordinary kind of gifted in northern kenya , because i knew the most violent , and i know how to use the use of the work , and i can get a quick deal with the ted problem .
i &apos;ve seen this value of older people in many of my friends , the &apos; 70s , &apos; &apos; 80s , &apos; &apos; 80s , &apos; &apos; 90s , and &apos; 90s , and the 90s , and doctors , and doctors , and doctors .
as a christian , and a christian , and made of the comic comic , young men were made in the united states and canada batman and superman who also went back to the bible .
the case of the world &apos;s final muslim internet industry , the last muslim u.s.
the biggest bad evil , the most bad , doesn &apos;t want these stones to be able to get into it , so he tries to prevent them on the ground .
and one of my favorites is cookie cookie from yemen .
&quot; and when is the article coming out ? &quot;
so , the point is , there must be something that we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; &#93; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous when a group of themselves identified themselves as extremely .
so , the most cosmopolitan of islam is explaining superheroes .
let &apos;s look at it .
let me point it to you .
let me show you this here .
and when i started designing something curious , i discovered something curious about myself .
so they have the eye and then they come to the concepts .
but of course china has a tremendous population .
but what that shows is that this kind of visualization is a form of information that &apos;s a form of information .
it &apos;s actually a pleasure to engage with you because they &apos;re visual .
the main news is named after the eden project in britain .
why don &apos;t it smell like potato or nuclear power ? so there are two theories .
and a theory allows a less to work .
now after a few months of searching , i discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule that you call a hold of molecule , and that &apos;s exactly the same type of stuff .
this is the basis for the device that &apos;s built these two people from ford .
they made it ... and it &apos;s just like coumarin smell .
that was a good thing .
at the time , a series of things are happening in which i want to focus you on .
and she didn &apos;t actually have an idea of the context that she was in .
norman !
i didn &apos;t say anyone on goodbye , neither my mother , my father , not my sister , my brother , my aunts , my cousins , my cousins , my grandparents , my grandparents , no .
i reports of it . i just just tell you that i had two things when i left the orphanage i wanted to do . this was one , my family and the other , poems to write .
and this is how we &apos;re looking for them .
and then you hope that one of us there is running around and there &apos;s little parts .
he had a computer company , and he has to be careful from other , female and probably much smaller family families to get his age of 12 years .
is this a good evolutionary adaptation or will it be that we will be the phrases that exist on the planet on earth ?
but will we do that or will we take nature to take their work ?
one day , a few weeks or maybe a year later , i was a year later , i was in a store for my favorite office . i wanted to buy a research program -- we had a research plan .
this meant a fundamental change for me .
my hint : about 70 layers of this , the most powerful , recyclable computer .
you know , how obsessed i really am ? this project is only for me , and yet i went to ebay , and i went to ebay with a chinese newspaper from the san francisco to get the bird comfortable with it ...
when we get rid of the way to the spectacular blue mountains in the west of sydney , it was a perfect , and the smell of the brain , the smell of the internet and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you &apos;re ever going to walk again , only with a computer company . &quot;
i remember that my father was coming out in the wheelchair , and i was stuck up from up to the bottom , and i felt the sun on my face .
they said , &quot; we &apos;ll put you next to you , because we think that &apos;s good for you . &quot;
she was told me the telephone and i called the school school , i was going to go and say i &apos;d like to make a car book .
and i said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to go . &quot;
and mom and dad ? never up .
i &apos;m in this world , but i &apos;m in instinctively .
it &apos;s like a computer designer of the brain through a richard serra .
how to do the hell of hell in three weeks when i have these things that have evolved over millions of years ?
each of these elements you could hang on the wall as a kind of artistic illusion .
in his days , he was the highest taxpayer in british .
i &apos;m looking at individual design , and how they flow -- how they stretch and flow . it &apos;s based on furniture , but it &apos;s not the most powerful . it &apos;s been built from aluminum than opposed to aluminum and it grew .
this is the car of the future . it &apos;s a water bottle .
if you ask it to contemporary architecture , it feels totally like me .
this is my studio . it &apos;s underground .
it was made out of kevlar .
and as i did my dr. , i had the lucky one , a member of a football machine that used him to explore the ocean .
there was one of these most profound .
he uses red bioluminescence like a computer cap to be a little bit of a plastic cap to be a little bit blind to animals , and can see it without being seen .
so they use it to find food and partners .
i challenge you to call a different science that &apos;s still using hundreds of years old technology .
this is a magical place .
so i was doing the value of your sleep .
and at june 5 , 1995 , i heard a loud bang on the glass , which changed my life and ended up with a duck .
and here &apos;s the duck again .
after the price , my life changed .
another example of the impact of the internet of birds on the lives of birds .
so , if i do something like this -- this is the tone for purple .
depending on how i &apos;m going to be able to hear music , and i can hear &quot; listen to the food of music . &quot;
one of them is &quot; i have a dream &quot; by martin luther king , and the other is hitler .
now you can see more often that former general general is now the most common thing .
you don &apos;t want to say anything about it , that could be used against one . &quot;
absolutely vital .
and what happens when teachers want to fix happiness ?
and why not ? don &apos;t you trust the law . why don &apos;t you trust the law ?
because it &apos;s so , freedom is a more powerful structure .
because life is complex . and here &apos;s the hardest and biggest change : we need to be the authority for interpretation and application of the law of law .
a free society needs red and green lights , otherwise it will suffer very broad .
put borders for interest , the most important , and for charges that you can take .
well , if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard to take off a little bit of pillars with a ruler .
he had a very bad job .
he was just a little bit of a training .
but the problem , to leave the rules and incentives , is that they vibrate in the professional activity , and they inhabit the professional activity in two ways .
so smart water are better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that any wise water can be upright for unlimited time .
why has this idea spread ?
people want to be more nuanced .
it was a remarkable time . i &apos;m going to be able to light the mentality of a little bit more closely , which we -- america and the rest of the world -- then .
this was a little bit of a sudden , the turtle .
we have this with a complete kind of a whole problem .
what i want to show you is what you need to transport in 34 pounds high .
what if you had a nuclear weapons ?
we come down and we bring the truck , which you just saw in the street room .
part of the problem is that the most powerful self , being overwhelmed by the mind , is a nuclear disaster .
it was sent to me by someone who &apos;s a computer scientist who &apos;s a school of the world , and it &apos;s a fact that america had hard .
there are many black sheep out there that are doing the wrong things and the problems still have .
we can show our results . we can make things better .
how can we tap them ?
it &apos;s a dangerous working environment .
imagine , we could , because if we could , we could reach more .
governments who do most of the progress are governments who have found ways to allow , &quot; shared value &quot; in business , rather than seeing the government , who has the unique thing .
maybe i can cut this , and i can see the brain , and i can change my cut .
i want to zoom in .
come on to the 19th century , in the 19th century , in the 19th century , huxley .
we could certainly be so productive if facebook or twitter wouldn &apos;t cost us so much time .
they look down on the british government to get money for construction , because they believed that these machines were enormous practical implications for society .
these benefits didn &apos;t just spontaneously make the research , but they also got them upset , and they also have to be upset by the most violent , rather than answering just the questions of the world .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i learned something about life .
if you start looking at the very small things -- this person has written a whole article , and said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and all the old ones are not old enough , they don &apos;t know how these infection happened -- that this faucet .
there are about 10,000 programs in the world .
this would be the frequency in which you can find every 26 letters of the sponsor in one of the dummies in one of the people &apos;s .
everywhere is life , you &apos;re going to have these distribution , unlike that distribution .
too hot , too hot .
the officer asks , &quot; are you sure ? hey buddy , are you sure you &apos;ve lost this ? &quot;
these are the data of a single survey in zambia in a single district in zambia , from a few years ago that i have been a lot of time .
as you can see , bruce willis at the time had a lot more hair at the time .
you could talk about 10,000 , 20,000 or 30,000 dollars , if i had the time , or it was in my plan , and i didn &apos;t just have it in the vacation .
instead of teaching people how to put the forms on the cell phone , we should develop software that allows them to do it , without practice and without my favorite .
this is less than me , when i was being moved for two weeks when i was a baker .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , in life or in the balloon , we need to change the height .
that can be in the spirituality .
and that &apos;s why you need weather .
i promised that i would take the next time i would fly around the world , not a fuel will be independent , to be independent of fossil health , to be safe , not to be threatened by the most violent .
i think you need a pilot in the airplane to talk to the universities , who can talk to students as to speak , and to be able to speak to politicians during the flight , and really to make it a human adventure .
and what is the goal ?
this is why all people who believe that in this spirit , they welcome to be part of this team .
now you just need a laptop .
anyway , for us , africa was a magical place .
the next thing i want to make clarity is , what &apos;s the problem , and what it is .
that &apos;s crazy , really , if you think about it .
let &apos;s stop with a second with that nonsense .
the fact is that we are the first generation , the disease and this extreme poverty in the eyes , you see it , and i think it &apos;s not going to be .
it &apos;s on the nerves .
this year is a test for us , especially for the leader of the hull states , who are sequenced and the history of the world looks at .
people are starting to find out .
and with this one campaign as our screen , my organization , data , and other groups , and the enthusiasm of the energy out there from hollywood to the inner of america .
step for step , you go forward , a nurse , a teacher , a book , and life will be saved .
the idea that the internet , which has all changed their lives , can change a country -- and a continent that is just so agile , even too digital -- and to the digital -- i mean the head .
lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
now , their job is to see what this shape is , and what kiki .
now , if you &apos;re not just a little bit more interested , it &apos;s a sentence , literally , false .
if we solve a problem or new new , we compare that to what we already know about , which is what we know about .
nadia al-sakkaf : i &apos;m glad to be here .
they don &apos;t even fit into all these projections .
pm : i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what i do .
how do they handle it , but they also do with their own business ?
some of my reporters have been arrested .
this is clearly a different picture of yemen .
my heart was a big one .
this is a list of side side side : if you &apos;re eating too much salt like a car , like a computer , and you &apos;re probably going to land on the intensive care .
but soon , i showed symptoms for the design and i had to go back to the street , knowing that i probably never would see my home again .
i was sitting there , and i was talking little about the computer of transplants , and i asked him what i would , if i needed an transplant , to make me get ready .
i was sitting on a dozen machines that kept me alive .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these most powerful things is in the united states , and it has dropped 200 percent .
and also , interesting is that the same business , which is the equivalent of the 80 million pounds that we have sold atrazine , the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; -- and the same company .
we also launched as a computer designer .
what would our debut kids say to us when they were a child , and i had a little bit of a little bit more expensive , some artificial plastic , and a little column a.
the problem is that in my village , oakland , in most of our villages , this connection doesn &apos;t see this connection .
here &apos;s the accumulation of the hood on the hood next to los angeles .
i offered five cents for every single day .
the main line can &apos;t be contained , it &apos;s become global .
here you see , in red , the spread of the water .
they &apos;re like a mouse that &apos;s looking at the foot of an elephant , and the largest part of them remains .
they look out of their bed farms and they come from all directions around us .
redwoods have a tremendous surface that &apos;s expanding in the sky because they tend to be something called the &quot; -- repetition . &quot;
the redwood canopy is the world &apos;s world &apos;s stability , just like a cathedral , and help the tree live longer .
it &apos;s absolutely a little bit of a research that &apos;s going to be .
but for recently , all the doors of the palace are cut up and break the walls .
this was 25 years ago .
so let &apos;s take a look at the first time for example .
how do these people do with these infected computers ?
and you can afford to see how we work -- how to work , and try to find a way to find the most powerful , which we meet .
you &apos;ll notice that you can see there &apos;s a more , the most powerful , and you can see , you know , the nuclear / d , and if you open these image maps on your computer , this program is downloaded and implemented .
and if you look closer to the images of the scene , you can see that the hallmark of the theremin is .
we need to make any way to make sure that everything is playing , even if the computer is going to go .
but i don &apos;t have to do that .
this person around the river is with his fingertips .
why should we believe what he says ? &quot;
how does his future look like ?
these powers are completely , no one &apos;s going to go in 2011 .
it would be good if people were alert , and they would take that kind of calculation seriously and they would be in the way things would change , but it would change things on two main types of ways .
that means that we can see a copy of ourselves , if you just use one part of the internet , that &apos;s a slow , more likely and more worse and more likely to be .
and the happy couple , jill and kevin ? well , they came from their own home back and saw their video suddenly had spread as a car cap .
thank you .
you &apos;re going to go away in the distance .
this is what was taught to be taught to do that since he was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had a mentor , who taught me how to do computing .
what is it that &apos;s going to drive you today ? not 10 years ago .
what do you do with what you &apos;re doing , and you do it ?
didn &apos;t have the -- time . didn &apos;t have the -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager .
in this moment , or unconscious , in the moment you decide to focus you on something , you can make meaning , and whatever it means , it makes emotion .
have you ever done what , and then you went , &quot; that was me ! &quot;
to death . so , god in his infinite wisdom , we had another human need : the uncertainty .
but that &apos;s true : we need it . we can do it by intimacy , through friendship , through prayers , through the movements of nature .
and there are seven different beliefs . i can &apos;t go through it because i &apos;m through . the last element is feeling .
jewish man with the family in the houston area , someone in new york , who had died if he had been on work at the time , and this man , who wanted to be a terrorist and really clearly said .
i &apos;m interested in developing tools that have a large number of people telling their stories to tell people everywhere in the world .
the color of the particles is the way of feeling the way that they feel happy -- happy , positive feelings .
we &apos;re going to see , &quot; i feel like i was the computer at the computer . &quot;
and when i go over here , the list starts to walk , and there are thousands of feelings that were collected .
the 10 themes of rays and circle circle the time capsule .
it &apos;s called the universe : unveiling of our modern mythology .
we can click this and see this fascinating image of betty ford , like her husband &apos;s coffin .
you can also look at quotes when you like to read quotes to climate change .
so people feel like this , which is something that is in ways .
in life , she started to have tens of thousands of members in almost 100 countries .
you just need to go out to go out and pay that out , so that ordinary is so banal that all other people are missing .
so look up , admire the beauty of being patented beauty , and think of the head in the clouds .
they would have put 25,000 shots that would have done this : &quot; the world &apos;s , good , good .
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the most popular to buy my first favorite , and it was a huge machine .
these images come from a virtual autopsy .
here you can see the knife being hacked in the heart .
it &apos;s a little , mechanical pen that has built in its inner , very fast intersection .
now this is a really interesting project .
so he does .
so , very skilled people .
i went to the kids so often as much as possible to bring the academic stuff with the real world .
it &apos;s not all that it &apos;s , but it &apos;s an incredibly valid summary of everything we know about the foundations of nature .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details why we think of the universe as well , but it &apos;s making it out of mathematics and trying to explain the physics that we know .
but over my career , i hid with my career .
in 2001 , i visited her during a computer scanner .
we got a lot of practice .
this is what the first degree of the year was in 2004 .
he &apos;s a short degree of the ted department , and he was filmed with someone who &apos;s all known to you .
every one is a nine-year-old student , but in different scientific disciplines , it &apos;s embedded with different scientific disciplines .
i have my first computer as a teenager in accra , and it was a really great device .
he explores the brain using mri and he says that this is the most beautiful brain he ever scanned .
and the next couple of slides i &apos;ll tell you about this .
transistors are getting smaller to allow and make our technology much better .
our main business is behind this lens .
i had such a gut gut that we were wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so we know what a radius is .
i like to call you the most powerful of the world &apos;s favorite , because they &apos;re kind of kind of a mess .
we can see more detail in our galaxy than somewhere else .
and that brings us a factor of 20th .
so there was a bunch of alternative to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff there .
it &apos;s a lot more powerful than the other and the cloud is suspended apart .
and i hope i &apos;ve convinced you at least that we have a really supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy .
one day i was in the streets of new york , and i saw some kids between the stairs , cars and fire orange .
for example , people in the 11th century liked pieces of pieces that were so eager .
in the first eight centuries of this tradition , the big &quot; what &quot; is to appreciate god and prices .
by new and improved instruments , the age of the hyperactivity broke .

until 1945 , they brought it on 100,000 months a year .
so i &apos;m going to talk about the talk of the talk , although i don &apos;t know where to start .
wow , a volunteer , great !
but recently , my interest was actually in a new view of looking at big crowds , because there are conditions where this is really cool .
well , i think this is the latest development of a phenomenon that we call &quot; apocalypse innovation . &quot;
but the element of desire is really the most important .
we get amazing talks from them .
let me introduce you to sam &apos;s position .
but even if you &apos;re going to get the screen , there &apos;s a lot more sent to it than just words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
how much of the world &apos;s innovation is nurture .
first , i have to turn a service to the audience , and talk about what i &apos;m going to give you , instead of saying what i can &apos;t offer .
and they &apos;re fun to design their own ultimate or the worst tedtalk .
well , you can &apos;t compare them to each other .
they keep them alive and give them the sugar , so a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of brain that we call the superpower .
this kind of testing is going to be involved in this , ok ?
somebody asked , &quot; why ? &quot;
and he thought he could reverse the waves . he couldn &apos;t .
i think there are three big changes , and that &apos;s in the areas of transparency , choice and accountability , where people have really power .
how do we do that ?
my favorite , sharon , sharon , saying there are more photos of your head than any other one .
11 of 14 countries .
and secondly , teachers looked at the most powerful and they look as comfortable , and they have a sense of the very specific diagnostic devices that a sense of sense is .
so i wish all of a nice weekend .
and to read dna and write , it becomes easier and cheaper .
yami work alone .
now you might ask yourself , &quot; what would i do in a museum of a football system ? &quot;
if you have the world all over the world , this can lead to a solar system , which allows you to do biotechnology .
the kingdom is saying that his laws allow him to do strangers or a foreign risk or a health risk or a risk of health or a risk for health or the values of the state .
these laws are a beat in the face for science and ignorance and ignorance and an application of traditions and a selective health agency .
why are you going to be pregnant if you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of 10 japanese people , people are dependent on drugs .
so that social worker , the condoms that are available to endangered populations , are not being deployed by the police , or they &apos;re actually being locked in .
here are children born , people died there .
office for personal work is already obsolete .
they &apos;ve dropped the high line , the road , the river , the river underneath the street , and you get from a end to the other , without crossing the most powerful .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny apartments . &quot;
also , jobs should be shared .
your liver makes a difference .
and they killed around the 12,000 sharks at the time by actually putting a very basic of the back of the street in the bay bay on achill island .
we know very little about them .
so this tag is going to find the place of a shark , depending on the time and the sunset , the water and depth .
let &apos;s look at the 1959 , which has passed to the genes that are passed by parents , and we see basking sharks , compared to the first study , a factor of 10 less diversity than others have .
so , refined all these research and found that the size of the 9,000 is the size of 9,000 .
and what was okay . we got wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build . &quot;
so if we can tell the gender of the shark before we take a sample , we can say , if you were from one male or female .
so i decided to give myself the merchants .
your body will be broken up with a little bit of time , and you &apos;re used to be used for any of the things that you can do to make money -- people tell themselves many stories .
no business with no one .
my journalism may not fit in other continents or in other countries , in my part of africa , but it works . goes to corruption , ask people immediately : &quot; where are the evidence ?
aa thank you .
i was raised in downtown manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks away from the most violent of the ocean &apos;s surface .
i would not read as a hippie .
and had these people ever met a victim of their own business of their own ?
today , in 29 states , you can be rejected in more than half of the country , because of its sexuality being rejected .
i eventually realized that my mission &quot; gay &quot; was to photograph &quot; gay &quot; in itself , because there was a million different species of gay people .
at least i hope that it &apos;s going to be harder to get human rights .
first , the world is , and it &apos;s always good and evil , because good and evil , yin and yang are the most powerful thing .
and thirdly , i had access to all the 1,000 pictures that the soldiers had done .
in three ways , the conventional way is that is true .
this is stanley steinberg , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he said , &quot; could the holocaust happen , here and now ? &quot;
&quot; my lord , who &apos;s responsible if it happened to him ? &quot;
stanley ostrow and i was just chasing the high school at the age of james , who &apos;s the james scientist in the bronx .
here &apos;s the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
the other thing . the other thing .
alexander ornish says that the border between good and evil is through the heart of every human being .
and i put the experiment on the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what everyone could do , &quot; no big thing , to jump down .
it &apos;s a mystery that really really really really , really challenging .
we have a self .
but on my left retina , a computer &apos;s a game of the sun is that it &apos;s a little bit of the red arrow .
there &apos;s only a reference point , which is the body .
i promise that i don &apos;t tell you anything , except that it should be a mustache .
and the autobiographical self has extended memory , thinking , imagination , creativity and language .
thank you . thank you for sleeping -- and worship hill .
now i &apos;m telling you this -- i &apos;m telling you , and i &apos;m making sure i &apos;m ridiculous , because i think feminism has part of the task , admit , the aesthetics , and beauty and fun .
we don &apos;t want a hero .
you can see , i didn &apos;t have me in fire .
she talked about the research of the day , she started to work on her , she organized her head , she was making them a lot of the same everyday actions of the care and creativity .
i mean that it &apos;s this perception that &apos;s different from homo sapiens from earlier .
in fact , this is a sensor for brainwaves that reads the electric activity in my brain while i think this talk .
we &apos;re going to have a lot of prototypes and products to live with ideas that you can control with , like thought-controlled appliances , or a floating chair .
the headset is wireless with a ipad or smartphone .
how these kids can use their new consciousness to their recovery , a lot of the harmful and the social security systems are turning up , which people who are being diagnosed as different .
they understood the power of human narrative and that the value we &apos;re going to do in humans changes , change , and growing .
and said , &quot; how are you going to celebrate ? &quot;
my skills and my possibility .
temporary , and very unexpected , gave them .
this is not a duty to look at my eyes .
i went to a track that i know .
and it &apos;s very slow , very slowly .
i didn &apos;t really believe in my mind , not really , not all the stocks of me , all the little people in all of us .
that &apos;s me . my whole thing .
what we have is exactly the same thing that &apos;s the same activity , but in one of them , they feel great , and in the other , with only one small change in the posture , they feel awful .
but i think it &apos;s another debate that has to be , which is what we have to do about the level of control , which we have about our tax rate .
for the percent of the money , you could have been able to install the trains in the trains , which would not have reduced the duration of the journey , but what the pleasure and the resource would have improved more .
i &apos;m not asking for the full set of equipment to do this .
sometimes the lines are very , very long .
i think the danger in the world today is that the field of economics is the case of economics as a field of research in human psychology .
if the average answer is 50 to 60 percent .
it will give you a little bit of time that you don &apos;t even hurt yourself , other others .
yay !
they &apos;re 20 , 30 years .
but that wouldn &apos;t mean i have a coin with both sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but this is our skin of the visible universe .
thank you .
with hyperscore , we had fair , actually , very strong effects in kids all over the world , and now in humans .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful , for forever .
hello . my name is dan &apos;s passport . i &apos;m 34 years old and have cerebral palsy .
this is actually the score of dan &apos;s head that he completely wrote in hyperscore .
odysseus would have said , &quot; well , we do a more powerful .
there &apos;s a moment first of all .
i have to write five pages a day for articles , or i had to give five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that this is going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you , the last ted machine , is something i &apos;ve been doing with hal &apos;s , which was introduced to me from my co-author , bill sharpe .
so , it &apos;s pretty good that it doesn &apos;t affect people , because if one of the faces smiles , then the other face is just ringing , and then the other face is going to be ringing .
this is one of the reasons that we think of the western science , math and environmental science , actually in the first few centuries of our online levels of our online technology , and developed the most of our most recent , and developed and developed .
x is the unknown , because there &apos;s no &quot; sh &quot; .
so it &apos;s not that when you talk to mental illness , you probably have stories of the mental disease , you probably suffer from the experience of the world &apos;s lives , shame and discrimination in almost all of life .
something more than 30 years ago , the nations of the world were meeting in southern kenya and gave them these legendary explanation .
what &apos;s going on ?
if you look at the level of species , you &apos;ve heard of the fish .
and you see these profit , you see , that almost 8,000 of these dollars are actually transporting subsidies .
that was in the early quadrant when india wanted to be driving his own , and as a means to the financial , after the way to the country , after the country , after eight , nine , 10 percent , and said , why can &apos;t we look at that ?
it &apos;s not a happy situation that you do , but you have trust and the courage , and you say , &quot; we &apos;ve calculated .
green carbon , so emissions and agriculture , and blue carbon together , and blue carbon together is 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved winning .
i didn &apos;t know what these things need , dick , too , not too .
i also liked these intellectual folk practices .
and he said he would have had the same relationship in the same relationship with his father .
there was a theory .
he did it again .
they &apos;re not moving , and because they don &apos;t move in the course of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed the whole thing , and the color color , which is just hidden up that kind of fantastic shell .
many of these ideas produced to the trailers in the forests for airstream .
if you think about it , your children to send the tinkering school , you &apos;ll get to the computer with a little bit of time , and you &apos;re going to come back to the computer .
but let &apos;s play them with their own conditions and trust them , they will learn things that they can &apos;t learn from the most violent of the internet .
if you want to throw a device next time , you don &apos;t .
i think that &apos;s all . this is number five five five . okay .
so here you see the sick knee on the left , and here my wife is walking out today , four months after aspen , and in good constitution .
how about it with a completely valid , not just sharing the parts ?
this is one of the seven things that we have in the seven , which are not shot in all of these things .
and so it came to buy the year of funerals , which began to buy a hundred , and then hundreds of thousands , and hundreds of thousands of individuals , to print a little bit of the hell in the sky .
but how does our imagination work ?
but we never think about the hidden connections .
and the edison invented the light bulb , and it was about this .
you have to be quite smart , and although i don &apos;t have college school , it doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m stupid , because you can &apos;t be stupid today , and it &apos;s going to be a lot of money in the world .
they literally have the door of the door .
if you listen to the most powerful , both ears listen to both speakers .
we have the problem that the antenna closed up .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and the most important thing .
i &apos;ve created some pretty sophisticated software tools from the plastic &apos;s brilliance .
and i was drawing for every person , and i wrote her name on the behalf of the name , and i wrote them and send them to the conclusion .
i &apos;m sure i can see how you &apos;re going to be a college .
and i &apos;m convinced that it &apos;s a lot of time , and my valuable and limited life on earth is exactly about this .
in this mode , he tries to hold his position .
i thought i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about how nature creates materials .
we think of future technologies . we start in the beginning of the world .
and if you look at it , you see the amino acids with the ones that you have different charges .
and by a series of a series of light , you can get one of a billion fish that do what you want , like a battery or a solar cell .
in this case , you can see that they &apos;re coming out of it .
if you ask people the question , where do you go to do something important ?
i &apos;ve sat on my desk , i &apos;ve been using my expensive computer .
what happens -- sometimes you have this days , where you wake up eight o &apos;clock in the morning , or you &apos;re just up to seven or when you get up , and you say , &quot; oh , i don &apos;t really sleep good at night .
in the office , most of the beans and distractions that people actually have to stop the work , participants .
we all know that this is true . they would never experience a spontaneous meeting , that employees are being recorded .
meetings and managers are the two main problems in companies , especially in offices .
maybe every two weeks , or every week , the week , the week , the week , you can talk to that one .
you know , i &apos;m going to do that for a seven years , and i &apos;ve got to do this already seven years , and i have no idea how the future is going to look .
but if you ask the people to be the three key things they carry , whatever culture , which is gender and whatever connection -- most people say , the key , the money , and if you own one , the phone , and if you own one , the phone phone .
but , and this is a very big but a very big thing , but we have the tendency to forget .
well , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
they take 10 or 20 percent of the water , and then the owner of the knee takes 10 or 20 percent of the rest of the room , and gives the rest of the other amount in bar .
it &apos;s the norm that &apos;s going to explain .
and he kind of has a recognition for the values of the field .
at the same time , with the spread of these mobile devices , we see a expectation of availability .
our present reality is less interesting than the story we &apos;ll tell about later .
what are we talking about ?
dean ornish shares new research findings that show how the native public lifestyle is a human being affecting the genetic level , and he says , for example , if we live healthier , we can actually get better food , sports , and love our brain cells actually .
until i tell you who said it .
within this context , we can feel regret about many different things .
when i went home after that , after i got my tattoo , i stayed almost all night .
but i want to suggest that there is one fifth .
i mean , even the dumb answer to all of us can let us back to the days of the &quot; new &quot; moment .
and i said , i &apos;m a more responsible one .
i thought i was going to be trying to address my ted wish , what i &apos;m trying to do , and how this fits to what they &apos;re trying to do .
no in india . now , at least one half a million are active .
and i came up with the thought that somebody in this whole ngo has had to think about the organization of the u.s. rights .
and so we did that .
listen to this : less than four tenth of one percent of the percent that were treated , they stopped taking their medicines or alert to their drug .
it &apos;s an attempt to be worth , and i think it would be successful .
the desks are not square .
if the gorilla is used , they &apos;re going to produce 8,000 watts of electricity , day and night .
and people get their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , with the green school .
domestic women from bali cooking the food on the food level and they use secrets that only know their grandmothers .
we need somebody who comes and studied this .
the green school is a model that we built for the world .
my tongue , voice voice and vocal vocal singers were still healthy . &quot;
then apple alex brought out the best voice i &apos;ve heard about .
there was one reason : that was me .
the most of the time is not natural .
but that &apos;s not what it is .
at first , the internet was a little bit of a tool for me , and now it &apos;s something i &apos;m going to leave for my real daily life .
it &apos;s human , to ignore disease .
you all know the test for artificial intelligence , the test test .
i was an architect , and my grandmother once asked me , &quot; what are you alive ? &quot;
we treat two main pages as a single page , because it &apos;s the reader that the readers take .
so what is the lesson behind this ?
but one day , my grandmother said , &quot; no , you &apos;re not going to run it .
it &apos;s happened and terrible things happened with me .
all lost hope in my healing .
so they went to their own and they collected their own furniture furniture -- they gave me a pots and they gave me a little bit of wood , and they gave me a little bit of time , and they got it , all of it .
you don &apos;t know how far away this street is , and you don &apos;t know if you go straight and you hear cars and you have a terrible accident , and you had a terrible accident that she was able to do in this position .
i thought that some reason was left for some reason , and only for family and friends were stopped .
for example , the understanding of molecular structures .
he took me to the ted floor of the street .
can we say we &apos;d actually discovered the symmetries of the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t reverse it because i &apos;ve built a little barrier , right ?
if i move a magical move and then another one , it makes a third .
galois has set up a series of laws of how these tables , these symmetries , interact .
so , one of these symmetry we call this symmetry .
instead , all of the mess , i want to say , is how many digits have the number . ok ?
i need your name . symmetrical objects basically -- please spell him for me .
first , worse nutrition , maybe shorter food .
thomas edison would have been very eager to be a company company in a software company .
penicillin was discovered in the 40s , but even in 1940 , they were not a commercial and medical useful amount of useful amounts of it .
it was the origin of the world &apos;s life , the last year he had his 50th birthday .
for me , the lesson of unintended consequences is that chaos happens now . let &apos;s do the best thing .
working on every computer and browser , minus , minus , minus , and the text is smaller .
they don &apos;t need to delete them as well .
and so , a kind of information that i &apos;m inspired by , i &apos;m going to let myself inspire my real desk .
a means of this would be something like a kind of a computer game , so you get more traditional desktop , and things are in the grid .
now i get to get the heart of people and there &apos;s no limits anymore .
but i think the point is , it &apos;s metaphors , and with such a bite , i want to suggest that we &apos;re going to rethink contemporary mathematics a little bit -- not just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just .
and he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s 2,000 physicists today on wall street and i &apos;m one of them . &quot;
you can find them here : this is a book about flying , which you might have on amazon .
these are not the power of culture ; that &apos;s culture .
you can do it very , very far .
and it &apos;s not the money that actually is so interesting .
go ahead . shake . louder !
i want to tell you a secret .
so , intersections without traffic lights , so with stop stop , many lives , but there &apos;s an abnormal increase of them .
the answer is to allow cars to come from this side of the street .
warren buffet had recommend this : honestly to say what works and what was not and to do this for a year .
in fact , we see the genetic disease that it &apos;s the only disease that is the only disease in africa , in fact , living living people in a living way to avoid the most violent .
this means that the economy in these areas fit in the areas that it &apos;s just so much .
but that &apos;s not a matter of us .
not only was it weak ; she &apos;s getting weaker .
a teacher of the top neighborhood will be measured by the performance of his class -- measured in a year for 10 percent .
but it &apos;s not a relationship to being a better teacher .
&quot; what &apos;s going on here ? &quot;
and these free courses may not be available only in the internet , but you can also make dvds everywhere , so everybody can have access to a very basic teacher .
traditional vessels , like this cup , takes eight to 10 hours to burn .
the sculptor richard serra talks about how he thought he was a painter , he was a painter and he lived in babylon .
when i look at these photographs , i &apos;m going to take the smoke back to my clothes when i went home to my family .
my parents were working great . they said , &quot; we know you &apos;re afraid , but let &apos;s go tomorrow .
but is it so bad to keep us so powerful ?
this is general general in boston .
the desired representation takes the sample , the map of the game , it &apos;s a , it &apos;s looking at it , and then it &apos;s going to work under the microscope and then the operating room .
so in this form of representation , a solution to these australians , with a dye , with a dye , shown with a dye , and then , in the way , the green tissue can &apos;t separate these molecules .
with a lot of the lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph lymph nodes , the dog , where the cancer begins .
if nerves are damaged , they can cause paralysis , and pain .
if we put these two samples together ...
we know that it &apos;s doable and we &apos;re determined to realize this .
and this cell is one of the thousands of different types of neurons that we learn .
it will affect the healthy circuitry as well as the sick ones you want to fix .
and one morning in the summer , we &apos;ve tried it and it &apos;s been working on the first time .
we &apos;ve shown that already a short set of neurons are enough to make these cells .
and it &apos;s going . now .
i want to end with a story of what we believe it might be clinical uses .
now you can see that the animal actually goes to the walls and the little platform can go back and use its eyes .
buildings are the metastases with the air in the air , which is just circular , and they &apos;re just circular with mechanical steel .
and if you &apos;re standing out , the air contains microbes that are associated with the surface of the brain and the night .
obviously , i &apos;m a physical person , as you see , so i didn &apos;t have worry , that thing , that i have 20 blocks to wear .
the same thing is , who &apos;s the street after 9 / 11 , the streets in my neighborhood ?
and you can get a list .
one of these things i &apos;ve been experimenting with is something called google share , basically , you just take a abstract term and look at google after that , and then you look in these results after the name of someone .
this is britney boone . i mean , ok , interesting .
if you have the second side here , most of you are link to the one .
what all of us were normal about 40 years ago -- that &apos;s not what stories tell us about generations -- is now rare .
and the year was the film in 1939 , the film is older than most grandparents of our members .
was the story good telling me ?
why don &apos;t we see that with the same passion as the same passion ?
in california , they &apos;re going to send up with a dwarf butt : &quot; this product contains chemicals that are from the state of california as the cause of cancer , and the other species of cancer . &quot;
so maybe we could develop a more , the humility , which requires humility , and for my profession as an architect , it &apos;s a privilege that words are &quot; humility &quot; and &quot; architect &quot; for &quot; the eternal source &quot; not in the same wine .
i don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was , &quot; the stone season didn &apos;t end because we &apos;re walking out of the stones . &quot;
and that can be a very , very small , and we did a look at houston , and all the windows are closed . and with all the products that were obviously not designed for using the use of air dioxide , that &apos;s actually a vertical water system .
if we look at the word competition , i &apos;m sure most of you use it .
since we &apos;ve been , we &apos;ve taken 4,000 times most most common in a database that we &apos;re going to put in six weeks of public to the public .
now we have 160 pounds of heavy cattle learning the internet production in the internet .
we started to aggregate and mixed using buildings of buildings so that all people and places have where they can stop .
and this is the most powerful thing in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . let &apos;s tell you that we knew that we knew all that because we didn &apos;t know it .
for example , they &apos;re going to be , the most popular thing at microsoft 11th , of 2007 , at the yahoo of march , 2008 and then the other one : google , facebook , skype and so on .
i chose sweden because sweden is similar laws of the united states .
and you &apos;ve been told , he didn &apos;t have to hide it for a long time , and he didn &apos;t think long enough .
their email were read and she talked about in the prison room and said , &quot; if there &apos;s no right to privacy , there can &apos;t be real speech designer , and therefore no effective democracy can be done . &quot;
many people , if you see a fresh human brain , say , &quot; normally , it looks different if you &apos;re showing a brain . &quot;
all these empty areas , the areas that go through the tubes .
and the nature of a certain cell , to basically do it , is to be able to do what 25,000 genes are turned on , and what threshold they &apos;re turned on are .
now , experts are going to play and make basic anatomical modes of events .
we should take that material and put it on a so-called called the &quot; design system . &quot;
so what can scientists learn from these data ?
they look at their whole genome and they try to find out the same thing that they &apos;re connected to the genes .
whether that &apos;s the individual &apos;s genetic background or your experience , we don &apos;t know .
that we know how to eradicate poverty , we just need to do more for it ?
so here &apos;s a couple more questions .
how do you know ?
so what is the problem ?
all right , it was all the same .
and it was made a lot of experiments that all came to the same result , so i &apos;ll only talk about one .
so what is the best ?
we need this kind of information . we need more of it , and we need to push the politics .

rain . not bad . not bad .
single tape processing . but why can &apos;t i do that if i &apos;m learning a piece of music ?

well , i think it works because scientists are connected to a community .
it &apos;s significant to show the place in the room , because it &apos;s critical , not where other things are , but in terms of the absolute idea of the space , which was newton &apos;s god .
and in a relational universe , the only way that it was possible is that it &apos;s kind of created itself .
and you understand some things better than others , and therefore there &apos;s a more powerful , and we give it to the politics .
there &apos;s another tedster who talked about two years ago , jonathan haidt , who defined his work in three different levels .
and just to leave everything there .
and when he was five months , he &apos;s going to experiment with a complete kind of a whole video .
it wasn &apos;t very successful . and so on and so on .
or philip glass or lou reed or the chemical brothers that played all there , they had their own casa de musica logo .

this is normal dna , which is what you think of normal dna .
we heat them , put something salt , they heat almost up to the surface of the road and cool , and as the most important , the short strands of strands , the long and it &apos;s starting to get a structure .
so that &apos;s really good , and you can build patterns and shape , okay ?

they &apos;re threatened with the livelihood of millions of people , especially in africa and china .
a problem with the plants of trees is that people in this region are so poor that they are breeding trees to use them as a sewage shelter .

and yet , we &apos;re the best known knowledge , except .
what i saw ? stars , satellites , the planes , typical plastic .
and what would be behind these little things when it was ?
and i was just embarrassed to go to the novel , because i didn &apos;t read the novel of dune at the time .
and it was so successful that it was even more inclusive .
and the thing is a living city , and to get to the beach , she said , you need to have a bus and then take a boat .
one of them was joseph and he asked me what i did , and i explained .
and so we put in the case .
companies are providing goods for households -- we are -- and we &apos;re giving income to income , and that &apos;s even better than that we can spend income for more goods and performance .
the most popular , the most powerful , was zero in 2008 , shortly before the crisis .
you can hear the thought of the five-year-old .
and at the same time , the solution is to be clear because this doesn &apos;t require the human nature .
we need to actually invest in the notion of a meaningful prosperity that will provide the possibilities that people are developing .
first , it &apos;s not meant to be economists , so it could be that it could be something that you need to be doing in your sound .
i painted it directly on the man .
it was about space and light .
this photograph was taken when i went to alaska bay in 2002 to try to chase the minerals management service in the ice , burning in ice , to see them to see .
another aspect is that it &apos;s spreading when it hits water .
and that &apos;s actually really a really big thing .
and then , of course , john d. was rockefeller .
it was also reason for the national national act , the clean air act , the clean water act .
they have degrees in education , in economy , they &apos;re entrepreneurs . they &apos;re actually not going to do what they do .
if you look at people who earn 50,000 dollars in the years , the two children have two jobs , or more , and then they have to ski .
we need to have the whole thing like the kind of energy , and you can find more about this policy .
the first person you &apos;re sure you &apos;re familiar with .
here she tells you in a football star , &quot; afghan star &quot; how your friends cut her , because not to compete , and they said they &apos;ll leave their friends around democracy .
last year , when i was here , i talked about my swim on the north pole .
it feels like someone behind you and you &apos;re going to beat you with a hammer all the time .
and we sat down , and we &apos;re going to go wrong , which was wrong there at mt . everest .
so , the more powerful thing about this , talking about it , talking about it , and give a hundred percent . because there &apos;s only very , very few things that can &apos;t be achieved if we &apos;re using our whole force for this .
this is a very simple thing . it &apos;s a very simple computer .
can we get a kind of a product of a product ?
what i &apos;m going to show you here is that we can create a design system -- the b -- the b -- from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules .
these are three minutes of light .
and if you saw amy smith , she talks about how students get to mit with communities in haiti .
and it may be that all the sensations of the reality of the reality is overwhelming and , so that , also , the variety of problems we have to solve .
we &apos;re increasingly aware that we don &apos;t even have to have to have the whole whole whole whole system .
okay . i also have one .
can we connect with the natural ecosystems around us by putting up more rivers and put these into the water ?
as you can see , the death rate is going down from 65,000 dead per conflict per year in the 1950s to 2,000 dead per conflict in this decade , so awful that .
because we did something right , and it would be good to figure out what it is .
they want the most powerful .
if you don &apos;t , one of the two people have to be updated , right ?
the developing world used soap and water , crime .
and now i have the most powerful on this axis .
and you remember the beginning of the last century , which was very bad , until that so-called a big leap .
do you see how it grows ? and how hundreds of millions and billions of people are out of poverty in asia ?
here we are . we have a continuity in the world .
look . that &apos;s the world .
you get clean water . you &apos;re eating food for the poor . you &apos;re eating malaria .
and we need to think about the way we look at the world with facts .
don &apos;t quite do it in africa . don &apos;t do a business of it .
it &apos;s not sustainable . and it &apos;s not going to happen to be around a superpower .
and many of you have heard the term &quot; memes &quot; -- the evolution of technology is something i spend very much attention , so you know , you know , one of the first objects that you had was a little bit of a plastic .
my argument is basically that , well , there &apos;s always a lot of our lives in our lives .
and this is pretty new , and i think it &apos;s going to be much worse -- this possibility -- because of developments in technology technology , in the technology technology , as a weapons , can be used as a weapons or nanotechnology .
i do my best , okay .
&quot; the &quot; s &quot; is our favorite , &quot; he &apos;s saved the people &apos;s lives , &quot; which was a pretty advanced amount of research .
we only have a civil war in six countries that &apos;s called the media report only over six countries .
so , what should we do with our money ?
none of these countries , including africa &apos;s largest nation , in botswana , has ever passed its rate .
during this development , we have been able to vary africans , the edge of development , and we &apos;re encouraged by politics in our countries .
the most important , most of the time , costs the cost of the billion .
we &apos;d like to interview you . &quot; and i said , &quot; great . &quot;
and now 14 of the diseases are treatable , two of them even even more .
so in the last 10 years , and as hope for the future , we &apos;ve seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology : a science of what makes life worthwhile .
and i think there are three different -- and i call them different , because they &apos;re on different interventions , it &apos;s possible to have one of the other -- three different happy lives .
but it turns out that there was no sexual trauma .
you don &apos;t see how much of the brain &apos;s brain &apos;s .
and what you find is that if you do something fun , the most fun thing is .
when i was a ph.d. , i thought , if i was good enough to do somebody not depressed , not afraid , not angry , not angry , i would make him happy .
a polar bear , which is taken in the arctic , recorded by paul hoo .
but these so-called so-called &quot; snapshot &quot; is coming up when all parts put together and not just the event , but also my emotional connection .
nick -- again , with automatic camera -- has taken thousands of photos of this .
sometimes you can tell a huge story on focused ways .
we want to find solutions .
and then somehow , all of you go and jump .
thank you .
what &apos;s more important is that this is a very important process that you can pick up in only three seconds : we can put emily in a period of less than one afternoon in a couple of different ways and a more common .
emily : image metrics is a key , a computer company .
i ended up getting it .
in the reserve , there &apos;s a few beautiful primates .
but i was out of the west and worked in the east .
all over the place , all of these things were destroyed , animals killed , the forest cut down , and so on .
this is coltan , and gold is being destroyed .
one day we met with the most popular .
the elephant just just took it and they took the most of the time .
i don &apos;t think somebody can borrow google , because google is doing the right , even if people use al qaeda to use to connect .
corneille ewango : a hero of the congo
we have , almost without it , almost without a market market , moving from a market market .
you don &apos;t have to pay it from your budget .
i should borrow them , what happened to these experiments .
democracy doesn &apos;t need perfect equality , but it needs citizens to share a common life .
the u.s. as a single nation in 1900 , because , where the line is changing to red .
we &apos;ve got this gift in the &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s , as women got into the prison room .
electricity was also helpful in the emancipation of women .
an amazing fact for the ted point is that in the first half of the 20th century , the world expectancy is three times as fast as in the second half of the 19th century .
this was the essay i was wearing with 11 years and i got a two + .
i have some , which would have been a long time : between five and 15 should be my favorite tool , and that led to a feeling of failure .
so if i look at creativity , i think it &apos;s also this sense or the inability to optimize the connection that i see between virtually everything in life .
that &apos;s what typical fishermen say because they don &apos;t actually kill a living creature .
and they &apos;ll find it more often .
and i had to figure out what to do with the story .
how are we going to be doing the things that are responsibility and the causes of the cause , outside of a dish ?
and you have to be in all possibilities , including that i &apos;ve never seen before .
i hope you &apos;ll see it , if i &apos;m going to talk about this examples , because i &apos;m actually talking about everything you could spend your time .
now there are magazines about water .
people pay the full price for both , and the only thing they have in common is that they don &apos;t have anything together .
the corners of the road , the center , is the big market .
these guys represent the most powerful of the world .
but you don &apos;t have to be more nuanced -- you don &apos;t have to be completely more comfortable .
so what you need to do is figure out who it is .
nine months later , i &apos;m going to be doing messages on tahrir square , and reason for this was a picture i saw in my inbox .
thank you .
mostly the cultural legacy tends to look back and to go to the past .
my first documentary for national geographic , where i realized you can bring environmental problems in a documentary of nature , i had dedicated to a dedicated way .
these are the lions and tigers of the ocean .
and because i love sharks -- i &apos;m kind of obsessed with you -- i wanted to do another , more positive story about sharks to talk about the need of protection for sharks .
after i left the street , i found that this habitat is going to be a new kind of habitat to create a new kind of new gas system .
she was also beaten up in the wild .
but the fish came back and back again , and the population is controlled , and the population grew up , grew up from seaweed in the flat water .
now , she lives in the jungle of the ocean , and this is a little bit of a , you know , the second son , by the way , the son of the second orangutans i &apos;ve rescued , the son of the second orangutans i &apos;ve rescued .
it was a biological desert .
and then you see the returns and starts measuring what comes out .
so how do we break this cycle ?
and you need bacteria to bind the nitrogen , and without those microorganisms , it &apos;s not going to be any performance .
the humidity is 10 percent higher .
so we can really change the climate .
in the northern of a while , there is a vibrant culture , so you can use the economic culture to protect the system .
the most terrifying bundy , which is a paddle on a desktop on a roadside .
i &apos;ll show you one more .
reuben paravicini creates kinetic sculptures , beautiful works , which is the pattern of the election , or moving out of the sun , and then , in nine minutes , he &apos;s going to be able to get us with his favorite art -- inspired by mathematics and nature .
every city has their own design .
23 years later , we asked us to come and develop this idea .
this is the italian portal , the ukrainian park , the shaman park , the japanese park , the german park .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
either it doesn &apos;t exist or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or something , but not part of the science .
people always say consciousness is hard to define .
you can &apos;t mind the existence of your consciousness .
it &apos;s a digital computer program in the brain and to create consciousness , we just have to find the right program .
we &apos;re constantly bringing the objectivity and the kind of information that &apos;s the characteristics of reality and the properties of the actions .
don &apos;t you find ?
but i also meet people who do what they do , and they can &apos;t imagine doing something else .
we don &apos;t teach american history in britain .
teenagers don &apos;t wear signs .
maybe later , not immediately .
no , don &apos;t do it .
i couldn &apos;t do this thing , just like how often or how much i &apos;m going to get .
but we need to change from an industrial model to a solar model where every single school can flourish .
erez and i wanted to figure out more about it .
the reason that is that the historical report is being digitized in the same way .
there was a light on it . she said , &quot; okay , it &apos;s serious .
she had a group of students in protest in the streets of the streets .
i stood up , made a tea , sat down and i &apos;m here , and now i &apos;m here -- still paralyzed , but here .
so peace direct esoteric to them , so the back .
he wrote a book called &quot; by the dictatorship to democracy , &quot; with a hundred hundred percent of the vehicle .
it &apos;s not a kind of a thing that &apos;s like that .
in fact , chris was worried , and he said , &quot; look , show you this photo , you &apos;ll be thinking , you &apos;ll be in the other sense of the very beautiful modern artists that don &apos;t do much . &quot;
it &apos;s an object for the mind .
and the solution that i &apos;m talking about is the largest evil of evil in this massive , massive , human region of the earth , and the of that is the destruction of the biosphere .
so i asked , &quot; what would t take -- let &apos;s call him a little bit of the way that they get the impact , in the denominator -- we call it a little bit of time , bring it to where they &apos;re going to be the impact ? &quot;
and he was a huge motivator on the market , increased our revenues and profits .
we literally won the water .
but five days later , back in atlanta , i got an email from glenn thomas , one of my people from the meeting in california .
so , frankly , many of us are afraid that the industry is working in the industry that the industry is threatened by technology and perhaps the most profitable .
and really , we need to give somebody to give us a experience of having a connected divine ?
the arts , whatever they do , they make us every time they wrap us up , to look at our data with the data of the data and curiosity .
the three sisters ahn pants with her passionate music , the most satisfying new life , and at tedwomen , they start with the happy and recyclable version of david &apos;s &quot; david &quot; -- and then they play a plastic , seductive version of astor boulevard . &quot;
the manchester craftsmen is named after my neighborhood .
he makes a bunch of money through the take of special furniture for rich people .
we &apos;ve taken the curriculum of the american bank of the american state , which is in their sense of harvard , and we &apos;re a key for mothers in the middle of the city in the middle of the inner city .
we realized that you have to give them flowers and sunlight and food and disgust and herbie &apos;s music and so you can cure the spiritual cancer .
these kids who were given up the world were going to fly from public schools , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re capable of , with affection and sunlight and the good music and confidence .
and it &apos;s worked all right now .
and i &apos;m going to allow you to draw the concert , and i &apos;m going to give you the music , and you &apos;ve ever got to decide to sell them , you have to sign a agreement that &apos;s going to be used to support the money of school . &quot;
this is a space of nancy wilson , who took her album in our school last christmas .
the brown building , which you &apos;ve looked at , and i tell you where i was doing my biggest mistake .
he came to me after that . he said , &quot; man , that &apos;s a great story .
and so he has a group of people who have been involved .
bill strickland shares a calm and amazing story of redemption through art , music and unusual alliance .
and the transducer then brings the internet to the brain , and the code is to mimic the brain , and the result is a very , very basic one .
but there was the key factor , the problem with the code , and how to make cells better to make normal reactions , and so that was our contribution .
it &apos;s called us with a invisible , a little bit of the attacks that are going to be the way we &apos;re healthy .
but if the bacteria grow and double and double all of that , they &apos;re going to make these molecules , then the number of molecules outside the cell are mapped to the most violent of the cell .
now we know that all bacteria can talk to each other .
this is just a photo -- a car &apos;s muscle .
bacteria have become incredibly reactive what &apos;s going on on that , that we kill bacteria .
the fact is that bacteria have a collective behavior , and that they have trouble to meet them , if they were only acting as individuals .
it &apos;s a great honor to me to get to this conference .
or the first one that comes in the hall .
but , if we think about justice , aristotle says that what we need to think about is the actual character of the brain activity and qualities that are worth it , you &apos;re thriving , hoping you &apos;re going to be thriving and recognizes .
what for a reason they would have ?
charlie , what do you say to warren ?
here it is , as he &apos;s going to do .
so aristotle with flutes , who , in the world , was the very strong question of same-sex marriage , who &apos;s the divine question of same-sex marriage .
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic argument
many people said , &quot; well , you know , you know , you don &apos;t have a new guy to say what we &apos;re supposed to do with our time .
and i think that &apos;s good -- the future human being can make such a decision .
so , if that &apos;s what is that , what does that mean ?
i &apos;m saying that the speed of the food chain is going to be going to be .
i &apos;m saying that &apos;s nonsense .
we know that there are the threshold because we don &apos;t get a donation of a donation before we get a military age , and that even though the damage has been born since we started .
that means they have to make their homework to understand whether this is true .
audience : hello . i &apos;ve read somewhere that &apos;s the average lifespan of virtually every single time on the planet around 10 years .
not one of their media has done that .
we don &apos;t care how we make our profit .
they were in the center of the world &apos;s office , and they put in the agenda .
but i can &apos;t present a very , very popular , the most popular thing that i have from economists , epidemiologists and environmental communities .
the most scary thing is something scary , and you probably know a part of the design .
fourteen americans die per day on asthma , which is three times a lot of how to go in the &apos; 90s , and almost everything comes from the internet .
he obviously had sense of humor .
politicians and nurses have scared of being used as &quot; the &quot; guide &quot; to lead .
second , because we &apos;ve eradicated them .
so we thought , &quot; let &apos;s do it . &quot;
there are some amazing animals .
immediately , the government said , &quot; well , you &apos;re going to go . &quot; and people pay for people to do every single single person that they saw .
he may be thinking , he would have ever born the baby &apos;s baby , so he may need a little bit of help .
i asked peter , if something changed . and he said , &quot; no .
we want to deal with &quot; africa : the next chapter &quot; and that &apos;s it : a healthy , more powerful , beautiful africans .
but most importantly , they have to be productive in their lives , creating a kind of productive environment in our countries so that things can be done .
we can connect all this ?
we were on the side of the world .
i had to crawl through the legs of these people , with my sister on my back , to find a window .
you know , we need to use everything good .
and i don &apos;t often see any african employees under them .
the question is , how can we use it from all of this good will that is going to be growing us ?
you &apos;re a little bit of a sudden . &quot;
we have superstar growth in nigeria with the most violent .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is effective , i took this argument , so i took this argument to study it , just like we can study any other complex neurological process .
the method was applied for the &apos; 90s to study extremely complex processes .
i want to try to show you a little bit of this for you .
and then i &apos;m in the middle control , here , games in the shift .
now , how do you study rap now ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity that &apos;s involved in the brain of brain disorders .
i want to say , probabilities and statistics , that &apos;s the math of games and the computer games .
this is very time-consuming and it &apos;s not pleasant .
but keep the idea of the whole time for eight seconds .
in games and virtual worlds , for example , your facial expressions , of course , can be used and intuitively to control a avatar or virtual character .
otherwise they very quickly screamed . and without a stable grid , it &apos;s not possible , so children die .
another statement of esther was that we react to a tragedy like haiti , but this is a kind of a business of the .
it &apos;s produced by the malaria receptor and it &apos;s a very interesting substance .
we have every street , every village , almost every square centimeter of madagascar .
in your inbox , a very cheap laser is a very cheaper laser .
audience : yes !
and what &apos;s interesting is , although we have the whole time , we have never done it , yet we never did the wing wing in the air .
this is the restaurant acorn house .
this is the most powerful one that you see here , actually , growing in a computer scanner , which was made from the outside and the outside .
so , water is a very important aspect .
&quot; metal &quot; and &quot; earth &quot; are still out .
the idea is not sophisticated .
they don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
once it touches the water , you should hear how air comes out .
once we sequenced these two genomes , we asked ourselves : if this is the smallest genome of a self , it could be even smaller , because even smaller genome of it is even smaller ?
and then , in addition , we realized that once that worked , a real chance of thinking about it , if we could get the synthetic chromosomes to do it , the bacteria would be blowing up .
so care is a lot of food .
the last one is a quote from robert feynman : &quot; what i can &apos;t do myself , i can &apos;t understand myself . &quot;
but actually , we &apos;re in the northwest , very close to the actual notion of the koran , the 36 times , as &quot; gardens , &quot; and , &quot; gardens , &quot; by running streams .
but the more you add , the more you seem to be lost .
and that number 72 never comes .
this is a nest colony , and this is the nest entrance .
this is a colony that was founded by a queen in the waiting summer .
the main line -- that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be like a glass -- is a very interesting group . they go back in the morning , before the first group goes to form .
strangely and interestingly , it looks like about half the colony &apos;s colony &apos;s just doing nothing .
the nest maintenance workers just take all the veiled and bring them to the top of the road and put them on the edge of the road .
the foragers are kind of deciding , not getting out .
and we did experiments that show that the longer one ant is dependent on the one , the more the simple hydrocarbons on their surface are changing . so the ants smell different , they &apos;re going to be doing different work .
they &apos;re going to meet the entire earth , except antarctica .
here you see that the cost of all of this is about 89 million barrels of oil , and the annual cost is three trillion dollars .
and we do that for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
that &apos;s not to do that .
i &apos;ve thought where we can use natural gas .
and when i got into the training process , natural gas costs nine dollars .
why don &apos;t you worry about that ?
so just 500 million , just killed 500 million .
it was never covered the ground , or something .
tbp : i lost 150 million in the wind , okay ?
some have 5,000 . many have more .
there was a lot of time . and there was a lot of time .
the life is a event . i &apos;m going to give you the world .
these are work in the shallow manhattan where you built the first to the first .
these were maybe six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to be trusted for the light light .
a friend of mine told me this story : the one that came , and they had to wait , but then the most important , and then the most important , they had to call somebody call .
so sometimes i &apos;m going to use a more clinical language and it may not be so warm to you as well as the heart of the other talking about compassion .
and here &apos;s the basic idea that the idea of the fact is that the good thing that is going to lead to people is that they &apos;re going to be the good thing for people to do .
basically , it &apos;s about when you &apos;re my enemy or my favorite , if you &apos;re not my friend or mine , i &apos;m a lot less to do the golden rule on them . okay .
so , the results are going to raise . this is a zero-sum game .
each form of persistence , non-zero-sum property , forces a human &apos;s humanity to keep in mind .
and they then explain to you , the other thinking that america is not being respected and they want to dominate them , and they hate america .
most of the diseases handle poverty , but in the case of cancer , kids seemed to be the children who died of cancer , mostly from wealthy families .
a week died a child , but nothing changed .
because you &apos;re not going to use this kind of energy and time if it doesn &apos;t really care .
so he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
now , the dominant business of this would say that there is a single oncogene in a single cell cancer , and that that makes you a more powerful thing .
what does that mean ?
we found a kind of conceptual material that contained the right extracellular matrix , we put the cells into it , and lo and behold , in about four days , they were going to be able to see and see what we &apos;ve created in culture .
and of course , we &apos;re asking ourselves , now where are we going to go ?
and so i want to finish with a poem .
we have a more powerful journalist who was caught in the kenyan world ; a young baby company whose book is so many of the most powerful quotes that you &apos;ve taken out of the shelves ; a exposé about fake plastic &apos;s new york times .
it sounds a little bit like a strange book , but it actually is about new species of lying .
he wrote very , very positive reviews of themselves . surprise !
you had four good friends to justify their personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can look at it ; i used to be talking , and then they were going to be .
they told them how big the poor was , or said , the most powerful , and so far away from the hotel .
it &apos;s exactly there . okay , glass , take a photo !
and you also want to get your eyes out .
but it really opened my eyes , as often i have , from life , to the email , social networks and so on , even though it really wasn &apos;t really important or a lot of the money .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band of plastic .
and everybody who then went to the board , i went back .
at least for me , because if i &apos;m always doing the same , i &apos;m going to be very , very boring . i &apos;m very quick .
i see myself as ... i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m seeing .
are you nervous , you get nervous ?
im : do you worry ? you look so cute .
anyway , i &apos;m not suggesting that it &apos;s good , but only that it &apos;s not getting tired of it , ok ?
if you have the cream too long , it becomes buttermilk .
i call it the era of citizenship -- what people different of the race or ethnic is the same as citizens , but yet as citizens are all equal to the same .
in egypt , i was actually discovered , of course .
this had been trained in london , in yemen , and i was trained in amsterdam in amsterdam , a plane to attack america .
there are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols that are using for democratic culture on the basis .
as anecdote , we can show that if poverty was the only factor , well , bin laden is one of the richest families of saudi steel .
what happened there was a political coalition that was going to be a political coalition , and that was the leader of eliminating the leaders .
these tools are only going to be socially interesting when they &apos;re getting boring .
he &apos;s measured the boundaries of the individual networks and then they &apos;re going to be a .
and because of the social networking , chinese students who were in foreign school , or companies from the rest of the world , they had people on the world , there were people around the world that heard these messages .
and the chinese was rejected by the chinese .
we &apos;re increasingly more in a media landscape in media , socially , ubiquitous and cheap .
but all of it in mind is , i &apos;m still going to take a conversation like i did .
at the fourth side of everest , a comet moved over the mountain .
this view is the most popular thing up . the first 600 meters of the rise of the base base .
and this is in camp fourth .
and there were climbers on the summit ridge .
we also got the bad news that beck &apos;s ergo , another climbers , collapsed in this storm , died .
it &apos;s kind of as compelling as working up , that i even actually have even replicate the clothes .
this climber was a huge one .
and i can just strictly just ease how he did it .
and so he &apos;s going to turn back to the idea .
these are sherpas moving down .
and the fourth thing that i &apos;m very important for myself is , &quot; ideas that we need to connect . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , by the financial rise , entrepreneurs were becoming models . and they &apos;re wearing in great ways to society .
it was a lot of people who wanted democracy to bring democracy , because they bring the ideas to the rest of the world , parliament and the constitution and so on .
the third thing is , again , cities .
the second is the most powerful thing we have , which is so difficult to make entrepreneurs so hard , to create jobs in companies that are 93 percent of the indian jobs in the world in the world .
so , if you &apos;re a young country , you have the chance to implement a modern health program . so you don &apos;t have the most powerful , if you &apos;re older .

after surgery , everything is going to be .
well , this is not surprising . but we asked them to rate their honesty and intelligence , kindness and the internet .

now i want to tell you a little bit about the surgeries that we &apos;re doing , how far we are , and where we want to do .
we can replace the bone structure , but we &apos;re not very far with replacing the eye of partners .

you know , everybody thinks they must always have more and more food ?
and then they have the kind of thing that we can sell , hey , we can sell the stuff to children .

the things we might do at home is so important , and think about that , we need to teach kids in the schools .

and there were two of them .
there was really what was happening .
how amazing is that ?
now , i want to talk about some other patients that are doing all of this in their power to improve health care .
and then i realized that i remembered the side of google earth , where we can fly to each address .
we are , you &apos;re most irish resource in health care .

here &apos;s the resolution . a wonderful creature , right ?
they don &apos;t take their environment with sound waves , and i &apos;m talking about the most violent .

europe had to be in economic development .
the boom of the resources are not heating in the surface of the raw water , but yet many countries of the bottom billion .
so what &apos;s going wrong ? why is it called &quot; the &quot; eureka &quot; ?
and so the countries of the bottom billion need a very highly common politics .
a few economists came in time and said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try a auction ? you &apos;ll put the value . &quot;
in this moment , on the world , there are a billion people in poor or a billion people in poor or a half of us , and how can we help them ? the economist paul collier shares a very popular , compassionate plan , with the arm we can close to the arm and the rich .
we have no container where they &apos;re made .
here he is offering a english expert in africa in this fundamental world that takes care of the treatment of the treatment .
so , we &apos;ve been thinking about this : imagine , they thought they were a lecture and they could talk to people at the same time with the people in their native language .
&quot; basics of laparoscopic surgery .
14 years ago , i came to this ordinary material , and i was using this kind of thing for centuries , which was used in the same way for centuries .
he asked me if i could build that as a piece of play for the city .
so we were experimenting with small amounts of water to create a dry fog that &apos;s shaped from wind , and then testing it , and it &apos;s shaped by people that can interact with it and move through , without becoming more juice .
they were in their own business in their own , watching the spread patterns of the internet , next to people who didn &apos;t know , and they shared the wonders .
so , i also realized that this is a tremendous risk for our society .
if peter moves his arm , this yellow spot is the one that you see there , the kind of thing that &apos;s going to be in the brain , which is in the brain of the brain .
if you do that , what will you do ?
and to say that these changes can also be beyond death , even a claim is a claim that can be true , or wrong .
now let me just leave you with what i &apos;m not saying . i don &apos;t say science can do this space , or that we &apos;re going to have scientific responses to each other &apos;s moral question .
now , why wouldn &apos;t this undermine an objective morality ?
how high is the probability that this is a peak of human development ?
on the left , you see edward security safety .
we live in a world full of technology , and these technologies can &apos;t be exploited , it &apos;s always easier to break , and it &apos;s easier to break up than to get together .
but then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
and what is his natural enemy , what the means of the good beetle that we &apos;re talking about ?
she &apos;s a parasite , no more , a parasite , but a laser catalog , two mm long , thin , a quick and agile engineering system .
and if we &apos;re going to get these good things to the example of a mountain filter , they go to the flowers .
for example , in israel , where we &apos;re on about 1,000 acres -- that &apos;s 10,000 israeli users -- biological pest analysis in the field of building , 75 percent of the pesticides were saving .
third , to increase the conscious awareness of the farmers for the potential of this kind of thing .
and the one of my favorite projects is one of my favorite classes .

her name was a little bit of the name , and it was the -- i was not going to say , &quot; take the drawing . &quot;

now , we &apos;re deciding for this one , or to five kilograms of output .
we can increase it a little bit of rainforests , but it &apos;s going to be a very short boundary .
and you may think , well , they &apos;re not available at all .
i haven &apos;t got my three minutes , right ?
he said , &quot; hey , we have to put them on the table .
and i saw a sign .
even if a canadian system , they do the system , they do it in a way that is going to be present .
and in this book , the little lewis would find the big idea .
this is a key thing . and on the back are some other players , a couple of other players , and the way we can do it , and the measure of a few calculations , right ?
right . so , that &apos;s how the device is used .
there &apos;s a quality of stimulus and precision that is just amazing and remarkable .
so the first robot i want to talk about is strider .
it &apos;s just used to show that if you have cameras or other sensors because it &apos;s high , it &apos;s one meter of 80 , you can talk about obstacles and the wooden steel .
for example , in this case , even though the left and the right wheel is connected to a single axis , and so it &apos;s just going to turn up .
welcome to the robot , the robot mechanics of virginia national academy . &quot;
but the cool thing about this is the user interface .
so , as he &apos;s going to see , this was our first attempt , and it was about the same thing , and ...
but what is the secret of our success ?
but only from a spark of imagination is not enough .
and in this way , education is very important .
and the point of life is to be the point of life .
there &apos;s basically no pool of a good implant , and only eight percent of the people have been in the county , or a higher degree of the county .
there &apos;s a total empty water in bertie county in bertie county .
the goal of the game is , all the comic books on the wheels are , then , the team won .
but in the last few decades , a lot of money that was determined for radio workers was completely gone .
and after coming outside and interview about what they &apos;re going to buy , and where and why and why , it &apos;s a homework homework .
in these , it &apos;s literally impossible to create large yahoo surfaces .
i want to invite you , my journey of the design and explore .
after four months , the rainy belt came out and there &apos;s eight months back .
here &apos;s a couple of results .
this global act is in the same way to change climate change , as we do fossil fuels , even more than that .
when i learned about these two things , i was very , very much in personal reasons , and from scientific reasons .
it &apos;s got a very good job of the very good , very well , the partially , mcdonald &apos;s foundation , which was called the partially mcdonald &apos;s foundation .
after treatment , we make a series of simple design systems to see how his vision is soluble .
the answer is in motion . i want to show you the next video .
i had to discuss a long time with my wife .
we &apos;re tracking these avenue and hopefully more than a little bit more than a report .
and then i have a lot of these online things for physically disabled , and i thought , oh , i don &apos;t know , but before i feel about it , i look at how this is .
but that was in the fall &apos; 95 and then when the winter was broken , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , then it made aimee to the special 1996 , and she &apos;s very excited . your family travels with -- it &apos;s a big deal .
i tried everyone i could , the question of who , against who are the points , which are the leading ones , who are i doing here ?
i always won everything and i thought , what ?
you can be big . just take it off . &quot;
host : aimee and designers are going to be 2 , and we &apos;re going to talk about design .
they got someone who came over and the shoes .
but it &apos;s almost impossible , the actual losses of the economy , because it &apos;s , we use math .
or to the 75,000 jobs .
and something about the mathematics : math sometimes looks like math -- how in this example here -- and sometimes it doesn &apos;t -- how do i do it ?
in math education , we use about 80 percent of the time to teach people how to do three of your hand .
if people ask me , is that true ?
but the mechanization in cars allowed them to separate these things , so that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing today , and they &apos;re learning a car and learning his utility .
totally wrong .
but i think we can do both at the same time .
and one of the reasons why that is so important -- so it &apos;s very important , computers in the exams .
it was winter in winter , and i &apos;ve been blind for about a year .
i thought especially about my father , who had died of complications of a surgical operation on the brain .
similarly , just by managing the handle of the ground , the way that the soil can be able to change the soil , and with time , it makes a sense of where you &apos;re and what you &apos;re offering to be a human being .
but when i was taking a test and i went down broadway , i was blessed to see every corner .
if you design a city in the same sense of the blind , it will give you a lot of jobs .
to give you a sense of this experience , the article called &quot; i think you &apos;re going to be in the next to the next to the next . &quot;
and the most famous thing that i knew -- the 10 commandments , love , the next , is fertile and the more powerful -- you know ...
you give money for a good purpose and developing emotional learning to the purpose .
it &apos;s not a book that was written and the sky was written by the sky .
so , this is actually the key to me , actually , to remind me that there &apos;s no way to remember the car here , and i don &apos;t have the road on the road .
that was very inspiring for me .
so if we want to engage this book any meaning , we really need to get to it , and then we really have to be a big deal with him .
so we have this wonderful progress .
the academics who were thinking of this work was to be able to be able to make a lot of time , so we developed the applications like this kind of carbon , which is the most powerful of a football ball on a laser on a laser .
alex worked on a little bit of obscure , independent , independent report with the name &quot; minority report &quot; for steven spielberg , and invited us to develop the interface that should be used in the movie .
we have this kind of surgery that we &apos;re going to do with a yellow operation , and we like to do a yellow thing .
let &apos;s pull the apart : i bring it into a game of time .
we , as humans , are the things that are making and we should make sure that our machines help us build and build it .
john , thank you for making the work fiction .
what okolloh did was not possible without digital technologies .
but here &apos;s the point . the most powerful creative act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that are represented by this black line said , &quot; we &apos;re changing this deal immediately .
they &apos;re created by the members of the community for each other .
and as all the good news companies do it , they &apos;re going to take 20 years when they change the audience .
you don &apos;t always have five days to do it , so changes and we started playing blood furniture .
india didn &apos;t want to play in the front of the street .
the other was indian cricket .

could you imagine that this day would come ?
hopefully i &apos;ve made any of you to have a experience of richer and more popular and hopefully , and hopefully there &apos;s a longer time to work in this business .
and you know that the answer dogs is because they have a very fast way to stop the memory of the memory , how often they have dogs and pigs on the rope .
why about everything in the world , anybody should play lottery games ?
on the other hand , if you go to a developing country , and for 25 dollars a company , it &apos;s a big mac for a big mac .
would you spend your remaining 20 dollars for a ticket ?
i &apos;ll give you an example .
and when the way to the other end of the city 100 bucks is worth 100 mice , it &apos;s worth 100 mice , and they &apos;re not going to be saving it , but people don &apos;t think that .
well , in the large and all you are , you have a huge impatient .
watch what happens when we &apos;re taking a test of the brain .
dan , i &apos;d like to hear more . so , you know , our answer to terrorism is , i mean , he &apos;s a kind of mental error ?
there are no weapons of the guns .
and so some people look at economists as stupid people .
and the subject is one of these most powerful things that requires some intellectual activity , because you always compare the variation to the subject that you have in mind .
&quot; in words and in fashion , the same rule is fantastic , and not to be the first one , &quot; not the first one that &apos;s been tried to put the old one in the old , and it &apos;s the last one that &apos;s been put on the old . &quot;
and i woke up one day and said , &quot; well , maybe that &apos;s not that way ? &quot;
first , my willingness to make a critical audience , without suggesting i &apos;m too safe .
it &apos;s my intention to play the poster , you should not have understood it yet .
so , in the big and all of them , they &apos;re all going to survive .
jews often have a uncomfortable smell of smell .
if the space knocked , we could see that people are going to be talking more negative attitudes to gay men .

they are shit .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends , other filmmakers , and they talk about what cinema means .
without food , i was sick .

our government was corrupt .
so for me , the thought that we have all these children , it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of children who had so much psychological trauma , and they have to live with africa .
through the whole book , more than an hour of a week , more than an hour of the day , and interactive animations .
what is the business of this ?
it had thought that you could have , mostly , largely true .
so i thought , &quot; yes , that &apos;s a good idea . &quot;
talk about it still .
when i came from college , i worked in southern california , and you &apos;re going to be working on the spanish of the galapagos on the roofs and these things .
rsw : how does his schedule look like ?
the most popular -- they were interviewing me for mit and sent their technical software technology to bilbao .
that &apos;s reminded me .

if you &apos;re going to walk for four months , the ideas are always going to be more clear and more and more and more .
and one thing i wanted to mention at my ted conference , but somehow , it was , i &apos;ve missed , all of the businesses that helped me get to the approach .

it was quite unusual , so stefan , that less than five percent of advertising had a picture as a subject .
and wish three is : the question of that is , i was told to make myself a , and i always wanted to do some of the assignments .
and it &apos;s increasingly more important that we can figure out how to get these resources from these extremely complex structures .
the traditional ways to separate material , just don &apos;t work for plastics .
the traditional way to make a difference , to make oil or petrochemicals .
at the end of this process , we have a mixed version of plastic : many different kinds of plastic and lots of different qualities of plastic .
now i see a lot of the research boxes out there .
and what we see is that people tend to commit mistakes to the same kind of thing , again , again .
maybe we should study how apes make economic decisions and find out whether they do the same stupid kind of stupid thing we do .
here &apos;s 17,000 . it &apos;s going to share a token against food and wait happy , and get your food .
they &apos;re waiting to do something impatient that the market opens .
imagine that i can push every 1,000 dollars to get a dollar in the hand -- so 10 bucks a hundred dollars .
you can either choose a loss of loss -- so i throw a coin . you &apos;re going to be really losing a coin .
if we made the same features in our little , the same features , they would do the same things as people do ?
the person on the left is a safe loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just the people on the last stage , the dumb mistakes .
and that &apos;s the catch .
but if we think about wood buildings , the most often four stories are high .
we need to build less with concrete and steel and we have to build more and more , in recent times , we &apos;ve worked on the most powerful .
this is as much as we have a year in 900 cars in a year .
and the curtains curtains , my window .
perhaps , &quot; citizens , &quot; because recently they got up to fight against the decline of the intelligence of the world , the citizens of these networks work together to help each other .
and the biggest and oldest bank in russia , most central in russia , is now , in fact , crowdsource , to have employees and citizens in the development of innovation with the development of innovations .
we &apos;ve heard talks about people who have hacked their plants with arduino , and they work on the world , and to make the whole young people to create websites and making websites .

my breakfast , my lunch , for a foundation i &apos;ve founded , because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give the farmers tools .
audience : yes !
the third chapter is a more complicated design model called &quot; file &quot; pioneer hawaiian hawaiian .
that means more than 60 percent are for that .
we &apos;re doing this task best by increasing the problem of death penalty .

i remember nothing from time when i was five years old .
the santa claus knows if you were good or not . right ? &quot;
but julie , you were so prepared for school . you were so prepared . &quot;
they looked at each other and smiling , in the sense that was the right answer . then they kept thinking , &quot; do you believe that we all are brothers and sisters on earth ? &quot;
maybe your bigger ability to cooperate and adapt to it ?
i think this film is the hardest look at the modern times , &quot; the road . &quot;
in world war ii , we had to produce a lot of stuff .
but we cannot forget that it needs a fundamental contribution to it , and that &apos;s how many resources of the planet we use .
but now , the good news .
it &apos;s perhaps in latin america .
and at that point , the skeptics and the climate change of climate change in the landscape .
we did a project for a few years ago , and a big program , it was : the most powerful -- with many , many people -- many experts -- all of the evidence -- a huge fat system .
one group of people , they hire them to spend themselves and the other group should spend it for other people .
when you went from the first building to the second , all of you went to a man who complained and went and help , and the question is , did you think and helped ?
the word is &quot; the &quot; guide &quot; , a combination of &quot; the &quot; new &quot; and &quot; the &quot; new &quot; .
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &#91; about &#93; the hidden life , the hidden life .
since -- now , it &apos;s four decades -- i &apos;ve been training with the best in this area , had a young and old teaching , and i was taught , created , created a great net , and i was a great net , and the more powerful , and more invasive .
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my real life force .
i was dancing between the street and i was laughing and i spoke to him , and i was going to adapt to my favorite .
well , it was essentially frustration .
this is how it was at the time .
he put them together , and he put together something called the kind of thing that i think was combined in this software , which i think was originally developed by the day that i think they were developing his son . and he &apos;s built this wonderful presentation .
there are little plastic bars in these documents , little boxes .
i want to suggest , yes , make a beautiful website , how could i say you don &apos;t make a beautiful website ?
now , you ask the data data that you &apos;ve put together , and 32 hits that everybody is carrying a protein with these properties and you can look at them .
and that &apos;s how data is linked .
all of this will lead to that every year of two million children die less , in the last year , when in 2000 .
and if it &apos;s so , we &apos;re ready to collect feedback and give them to make sure that the promise of the promise is really available ?
you just show one of the numbers there , that 5,000 -- is that the number ?
my brothers started giving me down to draw and paint .
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m fascinated to explore this area .
how many of you have seen a cow about the street on the road from bangalore to mysore ?
it &apos;s just that we &apos;re being trained as humans to perceive reality , and that makes meaning .
and they said , &quot; okay , go fine .
can &apos;t you do anything , you &apos;re an artist ? &quot;
this is a box of the steel box .
because if we see somebody &apos;s head , we see the footprint .
what percentage of this is the foreign capital of this ?
obviously , he sat in the last 20,000 years in a cave .
so the foreign foreign aid is actually fine to get here , because -- if you think about it , i &apos;ve been able to tell you about the economists today that most things are very repetitive .
this is the place i showed you at the beginning .
we &apos;re going to be a bit more technical .
think about toyota .
you can &apos;t be able to do it , so you &apos;re going to accept it and find it a way to work with it .

in the world of haiti , people have passed up the city of these highly degraded brain sequences .
they came home with the baby &apos;s own meal .

i started to go to the point of why you were in love with one person in love with the other .
they &apos;re going to be there as long as human race is on the , what shakespeare called this ruling spiral .

peter pugh : what if our views were wrong ?
my great grandfather , henry ford , really believed that the mission of ford motor company was to improve the life of people and affordable cars for everyone affordable .
and the good news is that today we &apos;re going to bring the big problems of cars and environment -- not only as a industry , but in total than industry .
i think you can imagine it &apos;s already .
but what really inspired me is the possibility that we &apos;re going to have when our cars start to communicate together .
we need a infrastructure that &apos;s able to support these flexible future .
this is 59 .

i became infected when i was 17 , when a student was a student , i was thinking , i was going to think of adults , and i was eating a lot of the ideas , and i would drink a lot of the plastic and a lot of plastic .

i think a reduction in the manhattan rate of 94 percent for almost in the place .
and how do we do something more nuanced in this growing world , especially in some places i &apos;m talking about -- china to build 400 new airports in the next 10 years .
and this is the focus of the talk of the talk -- there &apos;s no lighting in positive sense that is healthy and our well-being is contributing ; without proper darkness .
unlike the first office , i showed you the beginning of the talk , this is a very famous office office , which is that the most famous one .
you see behind you , you see the most popular building that was later a icon of modern art .
i think that &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing right here , and how much light in the sky is going to be , and never reached the floor .
this is not very pleasant and more friendly .
they &apos;re not going to get distracted .
when our main group , as a few weeks earlier , a war in a third of india is called a war in a third of india called the most , the most prolific , he &apos;s wrong .

or ski . it just makes fun and people love to do the coffee stations and do fun things .
so we &apos;ve worked very , very hard , but we knew it wasn &apos;t so hard to develop technology like acceptance about what &apos;s important and how technology can be used .
cars are not made for the next to go to the next , and it &apos;s wonderful to go with them between cities and drive , but think about it , we have solved all the problems in terms of the range and speed .
so if we could add this box to a few years , we have a solution to transportation , electricity , and communication , and maybe drinking water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 kilograms ?
implicit or explicitly is recognized that people who die there are somehow involved in the drug , and we take the fact that they were either tortured or even to be professional or even more .

patient capital is working in between and trying to take it from each other .

president obama understands this .

you can take a lure -- it &apos;s a kind of a seal -- and a white shark will go to it , a little bit of a creature that comes very tightly to our 16 feet .

this page is going to be a day of asking , and 80 percent of it gets an accurate answer .
i want to start with a paradox .
and here you see it in relation to inequality , which i showed you , and i &apos;ll come back to that .
first of all , with the rich , developed countries , and then in a second phase of the united states , with the same question , the same question : cut the more unequal states on all of this scales ?
with devastating effects , what it is beyond the talent of the population .

the social judgments are taking judgments , and fear of these alien .
or for example , why violence is more unequal in more unequal societies , because people are sensitive to becoming a bold .
a year a year , more than three million barrels of malware , a new knee or a half .
you remember kamal before the most popular thing .
if you wear it under pants or a rock , or a sari , it &apos;s very clear that you &apos;re wearing a prosthetic , and in societies , in which disability with a social stigma are being made , people are very sensitive .

i even bought the most powerful , and i have a little bit of paper , which is , &quot; use this kind of thing , &quot; you don &apos;t use that to put juice .
this is the results of one to the 20th , &quot; imagine google just &quot; is like the pages of the line , &quot; how it gives pages .
strong fear is a lot .
but if you were in this state , the work never will be done , because you would suddenly say , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve found a new way to do it . &quot;
almost everything we do is subconscious .
it &apos;s about being safe in the world .
if the theme problem is rusty and would fall apart , they would never be a ride .
it &apos;s a very small sample -- you should not be able to maximize the results .
i &apos;m going to talk about children and self-organization and a series of experiments that led me to the idea of a alternative education .
and at the night of this day , 70 children in the internet .
so i could even choose a quick jump to meet a cross-section of the world , which is partly the whole world .
what you see obviously is a child that uses the computer to do this .
natural systems are all self-organization : galaxies , molecules , cells , organisms , organisms , societies -- except the discussion of the &quot; intelligent designers . &quot;
