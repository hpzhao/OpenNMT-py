you know , one of the great things that travel in the travel and one of the pleasures in the research is in the research of research , in common with people who remember the old days . their past still feels in the wind , they &apos;re going to taste the rain .
just the knowledge that the most common thing is still beyond the milky milky way , or the importance of the oldest of the oldest of the eu , or that the himalayas is still the breath of the the world &apos;s breath , which is the most important , the world &apos;s face , which is the world &apos;s mind , which is the world &apos;s mind , which is the world , which is the world , which is the world , which is the world , which is the world , which is the world , which
and of course , we &apos;re all sharing the same thing .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re going to bring kids to the world .
we go through .
we need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to draw and we should not surprise that we all sing , dance and art .
but interesting is the unique damage of the brain &apos;s rhythm , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the most important in the woods of the forests , or the most powerful in haiti , or the warrior in haiti , or the warrior in the middle of the sahara , everest , the mother &apos;s colleague , and it &apos;s a colleague that i went to the desert .
all of these people teach us that there &apos;s other people &apos;s own , other ways to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
and that &apos;s a notion that , if you think about it , you can just fulfill a hope .
together , the vast cultures are going to be a net from the world , and cultural life , which is the earth , and that &apos;s what the earth is so important to do as the biological system , which is the biological system that you know as biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural system as a computer system , and you can imagine that as the most important of all the thoughts and dreams , myths , the ideas , inspiration and intuitions that have been made by the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness , defined .
the most great legacy is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and what we &apos;re capable of as amazing as a amazing species .
and as the biosphere was strong , this was what happened with the most violent -- just more likely to be more likely .
no biologist would be saying to the car that 50 percent or more of all kinds of species are a little bit of the extinction , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet , that -- that &apos;s not what the most important thing about the field of biological diversity -- is hardly the thing that &apos;s known as a business of cultural diversity .
and the key honey for this is extinction .
when everybody was born in this room , 6,000 languages were spoken in the earth 6,000 languages .
now , a language is not just the whole of the vocabulary or a series of the vocabulary .
a language is expression of human mind .
it &apos;s a means to find the soul of a certain culture of the material .
every language is like a computer forest of the mind , a turning point , a sense of spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages today , while we sit here in monterey , half not more than the ears of children are going to be in the ears .
they &apos;re not taught to be taught to be a little bit more . that means if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely when the silence of being a silence of the last person , who is talking to your language , don &apos;t have any possibility to have wisdom , or hope to expect children ?
and yet , this terrible fate of the world is actually somebody on earth , about all two weeks , because all two weeks , die , a elderly dies , and take the last open language to the grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; is it not better ? &quot; would not be a better place if we all have a language , if we &apos;re all talking to a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be a language . &quot;
let &apos;s be a little bit of the . &quot;
and then you would see , as it would be , if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so i want to take you in a journey today , and you &apos;re going to take a short journey through the most violent , a short journey through the most important , to try to understand what &apos;s actually lost .
now there are some of us who forget that i &apos;m going to say , &quot; different possibilities of his being , &quot; really different possibilities of his being .
for example , take this kid of the amazon in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the internet , believe that they &apos;re going to be the most powerful of the east in the belly of sacred snakes .
this is a people who not cognitively between the colors blue and green , because the forest is the forest , from the people who depend on the people , and the people are going to be .
they have a curious language , and a very crude language called the linguistic , and you have to marry somebody who &apos;s talking to another language .
all of this is the most disturbing past in the convenient past , the curious of these big houses , where the most popular six or seven languages are talked about , but that &apos;s what you &apos;re talking about , you know , you never hear anybody who learns a language .
you just hear and start talking .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the most amazing in the northeast of ecuador , a amazing people , that was in the year of peaceful peaceful .
in 1957 , five grapes were trying to take a little bit of a mistake and made a mistake .
they threw up the pictures of the air , which we would grade as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people from the rainforest in their life never had something more sophisticated .
they took these photographs from the forest forest , trying to see the face or the character , found nothing and the character , and they were killing the world &apos;s business , and they killed five of the people who are the same .
but the most important thing was not just the last one with the spear .
they &apos;re going to be each other .
basit percent of deaths happened by the deaths .
we were going to get the most old eight generations back and found two cases of a natural death , and when we were doing the people with a decent something about it , they gave them that one of the people died that he was died because of his age , and we killed him with the spear .
but at the same time they had a clear idea of forest , the amazing thing was .
their hunters could smell the urine of a animal from 40 steps away and determine what animals of this was .
in the early world , i got a really amazing task , when my professor asked me to go to harvard , if i was interested in haiti , and the secret societies to be able to make the foundation of the strength of the strength and the poison that was used for the strength of the strength and the poison that was used for that to make the foundations of the power of the power and the poison that was used for that to make the foundations of the power of the power and the poison that was used
and to give this big sense of this , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of the most remarkable belief of the world &apos;s favorite magic , and the very strict thing is not a crystal of the black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i ask you , the big world &apos;s world &apos;s great world , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , and whatever .
a continent will always leave , because the guess was that there &apos;s no religious faith in sub-saharan africa , and of course , there was a very profound thing , and it &apos;s just the little bit of the very profound religious thoughts that &apos;s the tragic diaspora of the world &apos;s tragic .
but what &apos;s interesting is that this is what makes this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living give the minds .
the minds can be able to be from the big water , answers to the rhythm of dance to the rhythm of the living , to the soul of the living , so that the most powerful for a short bright moment is going to be a little bit of the god .
and the most important thing to say is , &quot; you &apos;re going to go to the church , &quot; you &apos;re going to go to church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and will be god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the mind , you &apos;re going to be taken from the mind . how can you make damage ?
look at this amazing demonstrations : the most amazing , the red coal without burning , a amazing graph of the ability to influence the body that this is the body that this is the body , when it &apos;s going to be in a condition of extreme arousal .
well , from all people i met , the manchester of the sierra nevada was santa santa reed in the u.k.
offspring of the old civilization , the heart industry , the world &apos;s disease , was formed by colombia , and in the way that the senate moved into a very powerful , massive , massive , massive , which is going to be a massive of the world &apos;s seats .
in a very , very , very , very , very , these people were the only ones that were never been hacked by the most popular .
until today , they &apos;re going to be a ritual of a ritual priesthood , but education is very extraordinary .
the young of the young , the age of three and four years of their families separated and in a world of the dark world of the dark , in the front of the glacier for 18 years , and two years of the glacier , they were going to be trained to be trained to be able to mimic the nine months of pregnancy , now , to be elected to the nine months of pregnancy , they spend the nine months of pregnancy .
and as this whole time , they will introduced culturally into their society , values that maintain the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
at the end of the amazing , they &apos;re going to be a day after the first time , and for the first time in their life , in the age of 18 years , they see a wednesday . and in this particular moment of consciousness , the the first light is going to be the most amazing thing , and the priest is going to be the very , and the priest is going to be the very , and it &apos;s going to be , &quot; look at it . &quot;
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think about native weapons and landscape , we either have a little bit of the old and the old piece of the fancy wild up , which is in his own mind , or the other thing , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we .
so , native native are neither more , even more , you &apos;ll be able to get out of the grammar .
it doesn &apos;t have a lot of space for this in the world &apos;s body , or the cold winds of tibet , but they have a mysterious winds of tibet , but yet , the one is shaped by the earth , which is not based on the idea , but it &apos;s a very subtle intuition , which is the idea of the earth , and it &apos;s not going to be the idea of being aware of the earth , but it &apos;s a very subtle intuition , and it &apos;s a very subtle intuition , and
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid from the 13th , which is growing up that the mountain is a more powerful , which is the mountain , or your fate , will be a very different person , and a different relationship to that resource , and a different relationship of montana , which is the way that the one child is going to be , and the other relationship of montana , which is the way that the one child is going to be , and the other relationship of montana , which is the one that can be
whether he &apos;s a very mild one of a mind or a bunch of plastic , it &apos;s irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defined the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the woods of british colombia , and i believed that these forests are there to become a lot of time .
that was what i was doing to another person as my friends under the most violent , which believe that these forests of the stadium and the curved spirits are the most devastating spirits , and the most optimistic spirits are living in the world .
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries .
it &apos;s a photograph i took only last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is a lot of them , from the many of you , the most powerful thing that &apos;s the most powerful thing from the repertoire of the water .
what &apos;s going on so fascinating is not just the most fascinating potential of this kind of thing , but it &apos;s going to be made of it , and it &apos;s going to be made of two different sources of the sources , and it &apos;s going to be made of the way that you put it on the top of the family , which is a series of the wind , which is a series of the wind , which is a series of the wind , which is a series of the wind , which is a
this plant contains some very strong things that serotonin , the serotonin , and the very similar ones are very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the most powerful , how you found this stuff , this substance that contains you from different kinds of things also .
this powder is about being shot from a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a bit of a time , and the landing of electricity is a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to create a bias of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have a professor with my professor richard , richard evan , the man who &apos;s the most powerful , the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico , and i said , you know , that &apos;s not what you could do , you can &apos;t get that to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to learn to be able to learn to be able to learn to be able to learn to be able to learn to be able to learn to be
but the thing with the most powerful is that they can &apos;t be taken in the way they can be in the human gut , of course , in the human gut , of course , to be a name of the brain .
you can only be taken in connection with some other chemicals that the mao of the mao .
now the fascinating thing is that the most fascinating , the most important ones that are in the most important , are the kind of way that &apos;s necessary to be necessary to get the most important thing to do . ask yourself .
how can these people get from 80,000 species of 80,000 species of plants that are not related to these two of these two types of plants that are combined when they combine this way , a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a way of the sum of his parts ?
we use this great biomaterial , trying and mistakes , what turns out as meaningless .
but you ask the indians , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the most violent , have 17 varieties of the world you all see in the forest , which is the way that we &apos;re going to be able to take a kind of a way of being in the forest .
and then you ask them how they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do something , and they say , &quot; i thought you &apos;re going to understand something from plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you take any of the 17 varieties of the baby , and you sing to a different kind of a different kind of thing .
now , that &apos;s not going to get a ph.d. in harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than a more interesting thing to count .
now , the problem is that even the problem is that even the ones that have the of the hard situation of the native situation , they have a lot of the time , but they &apos;re kind of looking at the past , but they &apos;re kind of just to the past , as the real world , which is our world , which is our world , which is our world , which is our world , which is our world , which is our world , which is our world , which is our world , which
so , the fact is that you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century , in 300 years , or technical innovation , but rather than a era where we were present and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity of the biological and cultural diversity on earth , or cultural diversity . so the problem is not the change . so the problem is not the change . so the problem is not the change . so the problem is not the change . so the problem is not the change . so the problem is not
all cultures have always involved in the dance with new the dance .
and the problem is not the technology .
the most important thing was to be less on sioux than they bow and arrow , as the americans stopped to be americans when they stopped horse and the most powerful tasks .
not change and technology , the integrity of the most powerful . it &apos;s power . that &apos;s ugly face of the rule .
and wherever you &apos;re in the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures are not the fall of the light . these are dynamic living peoples , whose existence is going to be the most powerful people in the forest , which is the most powerful of the the river , which is the most powerful , which is the most powerful , which is the most powerful , which is the most powerful , which is the most powerful , which is the most powerful , which is the most powerful , which is the most powerful ,
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m going to work a lot of research , you &apos;ll see that ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the genocide , the most extinction of people , is generally convicted , but the destruction of the lifestyle of the human beings will not only not only not be convicted , but generally , and the part of a computer system .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the u.s. , if you haven &apos;t experienced it on the surface of the level .
i was going to be 6,000 miles of 6,000 miles of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city , and i was just looking for the head of the statistics , and i was looking at the face of the statistics of the statistics that were murdered in the world , and 150,000 million people who were murdered in the cultural and dressed . 1.2 million people who were murdered in the cultural and dressed . 1.2 million people who were murdered in the cultural and dressed . 1.2 million
the father of this young boy was identified as a tag of the world &apos;s office .
that meant that he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to send people to nepal .
his mother was locked up when punishment was for the crime for the crime .
he was going to be able to get in the prison of two years to hide under her own , and they couldn &apos;t live without him .
the sister who did this brave , was brought into a computer company .
one day she came out of a commodity , and for these kinds of things , they had to be in a heavy camp camp .
the suffering of the u.s. is the , but the most common mind of people is something more powerful .
and at the end , we really stand in a choice of a choice , and we want to live in a world in a world of the diversity of the diversity of diversity ?
margaret , the great anthropologist , the great anthropologist before she died , that it &apos;s their greatest fear that while we &apos;re in direction , we &apos;re going to move a thread , and we &apos;re not just going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
and it &apos;s a documentary to think that our species may have been in 600,000 years .
the most popular revolution that brought us to agriculture , and we put the in this moment of the internet &apos;s village , the poetry of the plastic of the priesthood , and the poetry of the millennium , and hierarchy , specialization and surplus -- found 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , these shallow history doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we &apos;re in the next millennia .
if we ask these profound kinds of things to the meaning of human questions , you answer with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to get the possibility to be able to be able to be able to be , people with full consciousness , which is aware of the importance that all people and gardens have to be a space .
here &apos;s a photograph i took on the northern end of the world &apos;s end , when i went to the most powerful , and this man , i told myself a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the most violent years , the most important years of our rule , they were forced to pull in settlements .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather refused to be .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the guns and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit don &apos;t have fear of the cold . they used them to their advantage .
the most popular of their granddaughter were originally made from fish , which was made in the world &apos;s office .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather was not convinced the arctic night or the most cut storm .
he &apos;s going out to go out , his pants out of the day , and he was going to go down to his hand , and when the feces started to get into the form of a picture , he shaped them in the form of a picture .
he &apos;s going to go on the pages of the street and when it was completely frozen , he was a dog with it .
he &apos;s going to be the dog and i was a very a very , very , very , very , very , the skeleton of the dog , and i was a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
so you can do anything like this .
and this is a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all the native on the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april 1999 , the complete control of a field that is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country , and it &apos;s called the world &apos;s new country .
it &apos;s a independent area . they all control the most sophisticated .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state , the most powerful with his people and can reach .
and finally , i think , it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who went to these distant goals of earth , to recognize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they &apos;re the most powerful of someone .
they represent parts of human imagination , which are coming back in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these kids are going to be part of the minds , like the dreams of our own children .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we believe that politicians never reach something .
we believe that the world &apos;s -- we believe that the most compelling is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website gets 35 million of the years .
and the world &apos;s nations are sending our own .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we can actually take a series of travel in the world &apos;s most powerful , which we take to places of such cultural wonders that they &apos;re blind from the stuff , and hopefully they &apos;re going to be able to take a half of the world &apos;s most common , and hopefully , they can be able to have a different revelation to the other of the world , that the wisdom of all people can detect it , that the wisdom of all people can do it , that the wisdom of all people can do it
thank you .
what i &apos;m going to do first is , as fast as possible , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we &apos;re microsoft , a new technology that we &apos;re talking about , and it &apos;s a environment where you can have a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
we see many , many books in digital photos here , which you &apos;re going to be able to do and keep a lot of time , and you can put it on any way to put out , in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this is a scan of the library of the library and it &apos;s in a field of 300 .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that the performance of a system can be like this is the number of pixels on your screen in every moment . it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of the world &apos;s .
this is a house house of dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it really is about a text and not about a picture , we can do something like that to show that this one real representation of the brain and no image is .
maybe this is a artificial way to read a kind of a kind of a kind of a .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a case of a case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a event .
and that &apos;s what you really do , and the good experience of a magazine , or a newspaper to read a real kind of a magazine , which is a kind of medium with several scales .
we also have something on the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a false ad with very high resolution that is much higher than a normal display and we added extra content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical sensing .
and this is really taking these ideas on , these limitations for the available place on the screen .
we hope that this is not a pacemaker and other nonsense more -- that should not be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i &apos;m not going to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re going to do that in this area .
but these are all roads in the united states .
the top on the top of nasa is the most popular picture of nasa .
now let &apos;s get something else .
this is actually live in the internet . you can do it .
this is a project called the name of the name , which connects two different technologies to each other .
one is a very good research , and the other is a very good research about the most important research of the university of washington , a college student of washington , under the advice of steve .
and rick &apos;s research was done by microsoft research . a very good collaboration .
so this is live in the internet . it &apos;s driven by the world &apos;s population .
you can see that if we create these kinds of views where we can penetrate through images and make this experience of the success of the success of the education .
but the spatial structure of the images is actually meaning .
the most powerful ones have taken these pictures together with the real space , where these shots , which are all near the most near the most near the most near the most near the most near the most near the most popular , and they were all the least in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly whether i have time to show you other environments .
there are what &apos;s much more prevalent .
i &apos;d like to show you a straight data number of noah , and that &apos;s from a early prototype of the world that we &apos;ve been working on in summer , to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology , which is the most important thing that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers , and we had to worry about the lawyers .
this is a two-year-old of cathedral , and that &apos;s just in the computer with images of flickr , and give them a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the men in flickr and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the top of the street . every one of these orange switches is a picture that has been discovered as this model .
so this is all the time , and they &apos;re all in the way in relation to each other .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i &apos;m going to be working on microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
and i guess you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras : everything is about the most important , to professional , a pretty large number of them , a pretty large number of them .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird .
many of you are labeled by faces , etc .
somewhere here is a series of photographs -- here you are .
this is actually a poster of odysseus lady , which was recorded right .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point is that we can do things with social environment , and it &apos;s now collected data from all -- from the whole collective memory , how , visual memory , the earth looks like this -- and everything will connected .
all these photos are connected to each other and it creates something bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes out of all the earth .
look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen &apos;s work .
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s through the complexity , with the people who use it , growing and use it to use the user with the user .
their own photos are going to be with a mile , which has a different person .
if someone has done the hard and all of these holy , and they &apos;ve been holding who they all are , then my photo is going to be able to get my photo from the pizza of the pizza , and i can use it as a starting point to get into this room , and i can use it as a starting point to get into this room , and so , in the way , the photos of the other people are using the most powerful , and so , in the way , they &apos;re using
and of course , byproduct all of these are the enormous rich virtual models of each interesting , the world &apos;s most interesting part of the earth , which is not just by the other or satellite bottles and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you .
do i understand it right ? your software allows you to be a certain time within the next few years , all the images that are used by someone in the world ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t make anything else as discover .
if you want to do it between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the amount of data information , which many of these images have .
as if you do a little bit of a little bit of the images , where you &apos;re going to get sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information that is the picture that is the picture .
but how would it be , if the picture is connected to all your images ?
then the scale of the world &apos;s scale is the amount of the world &apos;s amount of the world , and the amount of things that make it really enormous . it &apos;s a classic of a classic .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . thank you congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , like i hope , in equilibrium with other things they &apos;ve heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make a few connections , if you don &apos;t noticed that .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official &quot; .
the official of what ?
the official of all western industrialized societies .
the official computer system works like our goal is to maximize the common of our citizens , and it &apos;s all about the most important of the freedom of the individual .
the reason that freedom is good in itself , valuable , sense , a sense of the human , a kind of a human assumption for human .
if people have freedom , everybody is about ourselves to do things that are our own personal and no one has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is choice to maximize .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have . and the more freedom they have , the more of the more common they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply , that it would not be in the sense of the sense of question .
and it &apos;s also deeply deeply embedded in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what allows us to do modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say a little bit about the most short thing .
there &apos;s a great amount of time in my supermarket when you don &apos;t have the 10 different extra extra extra extra extra extra extra extra and 12 , which you could buy to make a big number of your own , in the unlikely case , that not the most famous in the store for you is right .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the business business to put a stereo -- speakers , a computer , a radio , radio , and in this one electronics , there &apos;s so many of the other people .
we can put a million different kinds of different kinds of different people in the components that are offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , because you could have a telephone , you wanted to have the phone , as long as he was from the creation of the bell bell .
they cheated her phone . they didn &apos;t bought it .
one result of that was that the phone never broken .
these days are over .
we have almost a infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is in the middle -- the middle of the middle , and the aerodynamic , and mild .
and you should not have seen that until you have seen it in your business , you can be sure it will soon be .
and what it does is to run people in the business and to ask these questions .
now you know what the answer is to be this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life , that &apos;s very important than buying the sex of objects , the same explosion of choice is true .
health care -- it &apos;s not the case of the united states that you go to the doctor and tell you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could make a do or we could make b .
a have this benefits and risks .
b has this benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what should i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a have this benefits and risks and b , and the benefits of the benefits and risks .
what do you want ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift is the burden of responsibility for the consumer of decisions of someone -- to someone who knows anything about the child &apos;s child -- to someone who knows anything about the child .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like they and me , if they think about it , not a sense of meaning , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do you wash around us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : you expect to take the doctor &apos;s doctor &apos;s next morning and ask a change of the prescription .
so , something so profound as our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide .
we don &apos;t make identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re so often making new as we want .
that means that every day , if you wake up at the morning , you need to decide what a kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage , and family , there was a time where the most popular was that almost every one had one and that she was so fast as they could , and then they got so fast children like they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after it .
now , all of them are just to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i was used to .
and that doesn &apos;t because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry ?
should i marry later ? should i just have kids , or just a career ? &quot;
these are all the questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether that means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m going to do and not get a good note in my class .
and indeed , they should do that . these are important to be questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl shows , with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every day of every place on the planet -- until the most popular hotel .
there &apos;s a corner of the way that i &apos;m not going to tell you about the most important thing that &apos;s going on .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of work , again , and again , if we should work or not work .
we can look at our children in football , and we have our mobile phone on one hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and even if you &apos;re all off , every minute we &apos;re asking our child at the time of a computer system , we should also ask , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly your experience of your child &apos;s experience , and it &apos;s been very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , is a question of choice .
and the world in that we lived in this .
so i want to say , there was some choices , but not all of the choice was a question of choice .
and the world in that we &apos;re seeing lives now .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to be able to do what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , a way of getting it , is that it &apos;s a little bit of a time to free .
so with so many options you can choose , people are very hard to decide at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another one of these things for a study about investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to the computer of the plastic , which is giant , giant of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 year-old the employer who were offered the employer to be the participation of two percent .
they provide 50 of them -- 10 percent less employees , and they &apos;re going to take part of the way that they would just offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 more , the choices are so hard to decide what you should choose to be on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , comes .
you know , that &apos;s not just called the people dog food , if they go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go to the food , it means that they &apos;re going to make the decisions that they &apos;re missing great amounts of their employer .
and it &apos;s not a participation to be in the $ 5,000 u.s. dollars a year on the front of the world , which would have been happy to reproduce .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
and i think it &apos;s going to be that the world looks like this .
they really want to make the decision really , if it &apos;s for all the eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment back , or even the wrong thing .
so this is a effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end up less with the outcome of choice as if we had the possibility of deciding between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is taking it through the great choice of different people , if they buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is the most perfect thing that &apos;s been perfect ? it &apos;s just the way that it was a different decision , and it &apos;s just going to be a different decision to make the better choice , and what happens is that it would have been a different decision to be able to do better , and what happens is that it &apos;s been a different decision to be able to
the more possibilities there is , the easier thing is to regret that it &apos;s not a conscious thing to make it .
second , what economists call .
dan gilbert has made a big point of the morning by telling the way that we were going to grade things that we &apos;re talking about .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to think , it &apos;s just attractive properties of alternatives that they &apos;re going to be able to do , which is the power they &apos;re expecting to do with the alternatives that they chose .
here &apos;s an example . for that , that &apos;s not new york , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a few on the rabbit .
very expensive real real .
beautiful beach . great day . they have everything for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks &quot; it &apos;s august .
every one in my favorite neighborhood is gone .
i could park directly before my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks of the thought that he missed the possibility , day , a great parking parking parking .
and the happiness that we get through our choice is , even if what we chose is fantastic .
and the more possibilities to make it be the choice , the more attractive properties of these choices in the world &apos;s office .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon makes some of the things .
he &apos;s going to be a statement about life now and maybe things about it .
but a more important point he &apos;s doing is always who you choose to do it for a thing , you don &apos;t decide to do things .
and these other things like many attractive properties , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do less powerful .
third : the expectations of expectations .
this has met me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost the whole time .
and there was a time in the way that there was only jeans of a kind , and they bought them , and they &apos;ve got bad , they were incredibly powerful and if they carried them long enough , they started &quot; ok . &quot;
so to buy new jeans after a lot of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans here , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the senior the company said , &quot; do you want to get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a sudden or a long time ?
do you want buttons or half ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you want to cut down far , and you &apos;re going to be a lot of time , blah blah blah ... &quot; and so on .
my jaw was down and after i recovered , i &apos;d like to have the way i &apos;d like to have the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour with all these damn jeans , and the business -- and i say the truth -- and i say the truth -- with the best number of jeans i ever had .
i had better . all of these choices allowed me to have better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it myself .
the reason that i felt worse was that i was going to be able to do that with all these available ways , my expectations , which is a good pair of jeans , and it went up .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have concrete expectations when it only was in a way .
when they came in 100 ways , they should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared to what i had to do , and what i had was a thread in comparison to what i expected .
it &apos;s dominated by possibilities in the lives of people who are dominated the expectations of people as well as these possibilities .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this . because if you would , you know , you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to be .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is , it was better than anything worse than everything was worse , it was possible to make the people a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world we live -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best for that you can hope to be the things that you &apos;re expecting to do .
they &apos;re never going to be comfortable because their expectations , my expectations , are great .
the secret to the most important -- that &apos;s what they all come to -- the secret to the most powerful is low expectations .
i want to say -- a short moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i don &apos;t have a lot of time .
but it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of the most bad jeans of a bad jeans , when there is only a kind of buying a kind of to buy that if you &apos;re a little bit of a little bit of a way , and you ask yourself why , who is responsible . what would you do ? the world is responsible .
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy one of the life-saving , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to ask .
they could have better done .
with 100 different types of jeans in the window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , if people make decisions , and even if the results are good , they feel disappointed about it , they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant thing -- not the only , but a significant thing to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have learned the bitter because they have to be so high , and then if they have to explain this experience , they would be their fault .
and so the most important thing is that it &apos;s generally better , objective , and we feel bad .
so let me remember you .
this is the official of the official , which is one that we all think of right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that is better than no , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choices is better than something choice .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m quite sure that we &apos;ve missed this point long at the choice of our public .
now , as a rule , i &apos;m almost finished -- as a rule , which is about thinking about the thinking of thinking . what all these choices are allowed to do in the industrialized societies is the material wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of them whose problem is not too big .
your problem is that you have too little .
so things that i &apos;m talking about is a strange problem of modern , rich societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry is , steve depp has told you yesterday about how these expensive and hard to get to the car seats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive decisions , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help it .
they even hurt .
it &apos;s going to worry about that .
if something of what people are allowed to make our society so decisions to make the societies in the societies that are going to have been able to have a little more choices , not just the life of people , but it &apos;s also improved .
economists call this a kind of a design application .
and it &apos;s going to be concerned that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all these big selection are going to be us .
finally , read this cartoon , please , and , a more sophisticated person says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this kind of thing . &quot;
chimborazo imagination , a computer view of the world -- and that is the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view that the fish knows something .
because the truth is that if you break the most powerful , it &apos;s possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the most powerful , it &apos;s possible that everything is possible , you &apos;re going to reduce happiness .
they increase the paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a more powerful .
this is almost with perfect security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the most important thing is , the most important thing is a recipe for misery , and i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve been able to do biology and now we try to get the digital code in a new phase of biology by designing new life and build .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve been in almost 20 years , and we sequenced the change of the analog world of biology to digital world of the computer .
now we try to ask if we can regenerate life or do we create new lives , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , stalin &apos;s , which has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we tried to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it about a hundred genes of the 500 or something that &apos;s here .
but if we look at these metabolic map , that &apos;s very simple , compared to our own , and trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we all look at these genes we can eliminate one after the other one , it would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to be the only way to be able to be able to be able to get the individual components and so some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we get a chromosome ?
does it allow the chemistry to make these really big molecules , which has never been done before ?
and , if we can , we can start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
our steps at the life of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code is very slow , but yet , and our last point would be put on an exponential curve now .
we started to start 15 years ago .
it actually took some years to start with a review of reference before we did the first experiments .
as it turns out , it &apos;s very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a little bit of a process , so the longer mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new method that we could put together these little pieces and the mistakes .
this was our first attempt to start with the digital information , the genome phi x .
it &apos;s a little virus of bacteria kills .
we made little pieces , made a error error and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of chemical chemical , and in a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made a viral particles .
the viral particles were made of the cells , and they were going back and killed e. .
recently , i talked about the oil industry , and they said that they &apos;re exactly doing this model .
they laughed more than her .
so we think that this is a situation in the software actually can build your hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go to a lot of time . we wanted to build a whole kind of a satellite chromosome , and it has more than a computer letter , and it thought we were building it in the brain of the virus , and we thought we &apos;re building it in the size of the virus .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information really has to be accurate .
when we did the genome in 1995 , the most powerful in 1995 was a 10,000 base base .
we found 30 mistakes in the world &apos;s 30 mistakes , if we had used the original sequence , it never had been possible .
part of the design is to create pieces of the 50 letters long and to arrest the other pieces of pieces to build smaller , to build smaller , to build this .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built the most powerful .
think about it : we have a little bit of a code .
and the letter of this letter -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids ; there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we just signed up .
some people were disappointed that it wasn &apos;t poetry .
we &apos;ve designed the pieces that we could just break them up with enzymes . there are enzymes that are going to fix these and together .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces of money , and they put these together to make the five to the letters , and they put these together together to make these together , until the most important .
in every step , we have these pieces of the surplus , and we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get the point of the world &apos;s point .
so , this looks like a computer system .
if we get to this right big bits -- with 100,000 base base -- then these don &apos;t be just growing in e. , and it &apos;s all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we used other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of the world &apos;s brain , which is used to fix biology that can bring together these pieces of pieces .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s a organism called the so-called a organism called the three million rads of radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything has so together as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely dry , they can even live in the vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life in space , and move to the cassini conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a kind of a molecule that we &apos;ve made by using this processes -- actually , we &apos;ve used the right thing to have the right design of the pieces of pieces , we &apos;re going to be able to get them together . yeast is automatically combined .
this is not a more common thing .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the most important .
these are images about a duration of six seconds .
that &apos;s the characteristic that we &apos;ve just done recently .
these are about the letters of the letters of the code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with the structure of the structure that has ever been created by people .
it has a computer of about 300 million .
if we would print it with a computer of 10 and without longevity , it would include the pages of the pages , just to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get these genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple to deal with a virus , it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier when you &apos;re in the way we &apos;re in the way we &apos;re , you just take the nucleus out and there &apos;s another one in , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about the clone .
and in the world , the chromosome is integrated in the cell , but we &apos;ve shown that you can do a complete transplant of a chromosomes to another , and that can activate .
we &apos;re going to have the chromosome of a computer . roughly , these two are the two as many of these people , like people and mice . we gave some of these chromosome to be able to choose this chromosome . we &apos;re going to have to have a very amazing graphics .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to get the process to something .
this is the most powerful of evolution here .
we all find all kinds of species here , or a third of the world &apos;s second chromosome , every time thousands of characteristics in only one second , a species of the other things in just a single one .
so people who think of evolution as a gene is going to be a lot of the biology .
there are enzymes called the most powerful , actually , the dna is actually digest dna .
the chromosome in the cell was no ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve put in .
it was been found in the cell and realized the other chromosome as foreign material , and we had just a cell with a new chromosome .
it &apos;s a blue , and it &apos;s the gene that we put in .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species and transformed completely into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we have .
it may sound like the genomic , but we can do that by moving the most dramatic things , and we can change things quite dramatic .
now i &apos;ve been ashamed that this is not the most important thing -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years .
and i &apos;ve been able to have a new form of the stereotype of the stereotype of the mesh explosion in the massive of the field of design in the massive design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re in the next 40 billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1800 .
today , three people are in this planet for every one of the year , in the year , in 40 years , it &apos;s going to be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
it will offer a challenge for nine .
we need over five billion tons of coal , and we need billions of dollars , and that &apos;s a hundred million grapes a day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace it , it will be a huge challenge .
and then , of course , there &apos;s all co2 from this material in the atmosphere .
we now have , from our discoveries of all around the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the most important of the future .
the most violent had a dozen components and see the diversity of that .
we &apos;re going to be in first line in the limits of biological reality and at those of our imagination .
we have technologies today because of this fast , fast , to do what we call genetics .
we have a big robot to build a big robot in the day .
if you &apos;re going to make this 20 million different genes , or to optimize these processes to make fuel fuel , or drugs new vaccines , we can change a little bit more molecular molecular science than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just a selection selection . we can go to the world &apos;s production , production of chemicals or the same thing .
this is a shot of real time we &apos;re working on , with the fact that you &apos;re actually sitting down and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it will look like it &apos;s going to look like the genetic code .
we &apos;re now focusing on fuel of the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn recently to ethanol what &apos;s a bad experiment .
we have fuel of the world &apos;s own generation and third generation , the relatively soon , the much higher , the much higher , as fuel or different kinds of information .
but , as we think , the only way of having a big impact without more increases is the cost of the cost of food or the shake of their availability , if we see co2 as a cause , and therefore we &apos;re working on cells that are going to go to this path , and so we &apos;re working on cells that go to this way .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first generation of the fourth generation , and that in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we all have kinds of different ways .
this is a organism that we &apos;ve described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about a mile , in almost a little bit of a sudden , in almost a little bit of a sudden .
it &apos;s turning co2 into methane to use the use of hydrogen as a source source .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use co2 co2 , which could just be brought to the same , and that could be the co2 in fuel to make this process .
within a short period of time we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- the goals of the whole secondary industry , and it &apos;s exactly what you can do , if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? a main director of energy .
but we &apos;re working on this right now , the same approaches for development of vaccines .
they &apos;ve seen this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year back and have a dollar to little , if it goes to the right vaccine .
i think that &apos;s changing by being created by the most powerful vaccines in the world &apos;s office .
this is what the future might look like , could be accelerating with changes today , and it &apos;s accelerating today with synthetic bacteria , and perhaps the most powerful .
we &apos;re light out of people to improve people , and our goal is just that we have a chance to survive a long enough to survive . thank you very much .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised back to explain to you how the machine works .
so , it &apos;s very far . and for all those who were not there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that was ever the most popular thing -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a second second after the universe , and that &apos;s the to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine below geneva .
we take pictures of these kinds of things in detectors .
i &apos;m working on this work , and he &apos;s called atlas -- 44 meters in the width , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas that you see the scale .
at 10th september last year , the machine was going to be the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it &apos;s huge in the control of the control of the control .
it &apos;s a picture of the first thing that the entire way to take the lhc to the lhc , then with a part of the lhc , to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture at 10 september , we knew that the machine works , what a big triumph is .
i don &apos;t know if this created the largest most popular , or that , as someone &apos;s going to go to google and the front page .
it means we reached a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires -- these golden wires here .
these wires lead to the way that the machine goes on to the surface of the machine .
now , the engineers are going to look at them and say , &quot; no that you don &apos;t . that &apos;s little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you &apos;re very much cold , you &apos;ll be a very strong thing .
so in minus , it &apos;s hotter than the space between the stars , can be able to get these wires .
in one of the connections between the surface of the lhc , there was a little bit of a plastic .
so , this is the wires that are going to be used and the banks suddenly have a electric resistance .
this was the result .
well , that &apos;s a wonderful thing , and it &apos;s a very beautiful thing to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we &apos;re called them new , they &apos;re going to be .
they &apos;re all back to their way .
and the end of march is going to be a little bit more sensitive to the lhc .
we &apos;re going to turn it up , and we &apos;re going to collect the data in june or july , and we &apos;re going to go to our journey , and we &apos;re going to go to the journey of what the building blocks are .
now , of course , on a kind of newtonian , these accidents , the debate to the value of science and engineering , it &apos;s easy to make something like this .
i think that &apos;s so hard that it &apos;s so hard to reach the fact that we &apos;re going to reach beyond our limits , form the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my favorite words a english scientist , and i &apos;m going to leave you , and i &apos;m going to show you the most important thing , which is how i suspect the most powerful experiments of his favorite , his apprentice was michael , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re saying , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind , as you know , that our scientific ideas are , &quot; don &apos;t have a mystery of the human mind , and that it &apos;s not a new worlds
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
books to write my profession is , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big life , life love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
but the recent thing is , the recent thing is that i was going to be a little bit weird in my life and my career , which has been brought to me to think of this work completely .
this curious event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called a biography called the name of the day , and the , love , love , decided , decided to be different than all my previous books from some reasons in the world and a big amount of international , international , international .
the result is that i don &apos;t matter where i &apos;m going to get , treated as if i &apos;m going to get the fall of the light .
seriously -- the fall of the fall !
for example , you &apos;re going to be concerned about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re never going to get this success ?
don &apos;t you have fear that you &apos;re going to be able to make your whole life and never create a book that anyone in the world is interested in ?
okay , it really makes courage .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago when i told a teenager for the first time , i was a writer with the same kind of a response .
people said , &quot; did you have no fear of having success ?
did you have no fear that you kill the preference of a letter ?
did you have no fear that you &apos;re going to be able to get your life for your life and never get something and you &apos;re going to die on a computer company -- your mouth filled with the bitter , the failure of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : &quot; yes . &quot;
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i had always had .
and i &apos;ve been afraid of fear more things that nobody would be .
like algae -- and other frightening things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it for recently , and i ask myself why ?
is this reasonable ?
is it logical that someone should be expected to do that , that he &apos;s afraid to do the work he feels ?
and what &apos;s exactly about the creative enterprise that they &apos;re making us insecure about the very common manufacturing of the world -- in a way that others don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemist and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist he was asking , to be a chemist .
with your favorite , john -- how do you go to this ?
it just didn &apos;t come , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not given the reputation of the world &apos;s reputation of the people .
we seem to have the writers , but we have the kind of reputation , but not only the writers , but the creative of all the all the salmon , seem to be , mentally , mentally unstable .
everything you need to do is , the bitter is really great to look at the most amazing head of the 20th century , which died young and often from your own hand .
and even those who don &apos;t actually have been done by their talents , actually , had been neglected by their talents .
norman , once he said , &quot; his death in his last interview : &quot; every one of my books has killed me a little bit further . &quot;
a extraordinary statement that you can do about your life life .
but we don &apos;t even have a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of saying , because we &apos;re going to hear this kind of talk for this long time . somehow we &apos;ve been able to get the notion of the idea and collective , and that art -- the end of the way that art and suffering -- always to the end of the world .
the question i want to ask every one here is that this idea is completely fine ?
you &apos;re going to feel that ? because just a centimeter ends away -- i feel with this notion of all .
i find them more striking .
and i think they &apos;re going to be dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to watch how they &apos;re going to be taken into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we encourage our big creative creative .
and i definitely know that it &apos;s for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , start , this dark path of the guess of the guess of the guess of the guess that i just was in my career .
that &apos;s -- you see , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 of the time in me .
and it &apos;s very likely to be that everything i &apos;m going to write from now from the world as the work is going to be the work of my last book , right ?
i say it &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a friends , because we &apos;re all kind of friends -- it &apos;s very likely to mean my greatest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thought that someone can get to go to the morning , to drink , to drink , and i don &apos;t want to .
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time , i seems to be that i can continue to write , a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a psychological psychological construct .
and i have to find from a way to find a safe distance to real , and i &apos;m very natural in the way that the reaction is going to be on writing .
while i &apos;ve been looking for models for models for models , i also looked at the past , and i tried to find other societies to see whether you might be better or more , to see if you could help better or more , as we can help , how to help the emotional risks , which are connected to creativity .
this is what i was looking at in the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
but in the old greece , rome , the people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a distant , unknown source of people -- from the most popular , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these divine things of creativity , the creativity of creativity .
by socrates , he &apos;s known that he believed he had a computer company who was taking him out of the distance .
the roman idea had the same idea , called this kind of kind of a creative genius , a genius genius .
this is great . the roman thought didn &apos;t really think a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical , which was the kind of magical , which was literally in the walls of a computer , which is literally in the walls of a computer , like the most powerful , the most powerful , the most powerful and the artist in the work of work .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s this , because it &apos;s the distance i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artist of the most popular thing was protected in a certain way , like , for example , too much , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at everything for you , everybody knew that you had this kind of genius that helped you .
if your work is going to be -- not completely your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew your genius was something paralyzed .
so the people in the west really thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s ask the human individual to the center of the universe -- about all gods and mystery . and there &apos;s no room .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational duplex and people started believing that creativity was completely from their individual individual .
for the first time , you hear people that , or the artists , and they call a genius -- instead of that he has a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a naked person to allow that he thinks he &apos;s thinking , or she &apos;s like the head , like the the blogosphere and the essence and the the source of all the divine , creative , infinite mystery , a little bit of responsibility , a little bit of responsibility .
it &apos;s like asking someone to eat the sun .
the conceptual and distorted whole egos and it creates all these non-visual gases in success .
i think that &apos;s the most important thing that we &apos;ve been doing last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true .
can we change it ?
maybe a ancient understanding about the relationship between people and mystery of creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just get rational to the most rational , and we can &apos;t just eradicate a lot of a time in a field of a talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience that would be really a scientific scientific doubt about the idea of -- basically -- -- -- most of the time -- the people who are acting and the people in their projects .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to address is why not ?
why not think about it ?
because it makes a lot of sense of everything that i &apos;ve heard about when it was about that , the absolutely crazy thing that &apos;s going to be the creative process of the creative process .
a process that -- how everyone knows that it &apos;s ever trying to do something -- so in other words , in other words , all here -- not always reasonable action .
in fact , he can actually feel really like the same thing .
i was a encounter recently , and i met the extraordinary american poet , which is now about 90 , but you &apos;ve been in the entire life , and she told me that she was working on the top of virginia , she said she was working on the fields . she said she was going to feel and hear how a poem was working on the landscape . she said she was going to be in the room . she said she was going to feel and hear how a poem was working on the landscape . she
she said it would be like a little bit of a train .
the country on them would be in the country .
she felt when it came , because it would bring the earth under her feet to the earthquake .
she knew that they could only do one moment , and that was -- in their words -- in their words -- the devil race like the devil .
she ran like the devil to the house as she was tracking by this poem , and it was just that they had to get fast enough to a sheet of paper and a pen , so they could get it through the sheet of the sheet , and they could hold it out of the sheet .
in other words , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she ran the house , and she didn &apos;t get the house through her and she was going to be able to go through it , and she said it &apos;s going to go through the country , and she said it .
and then there were these moments -- the part i never forget -- she said that there were moments that they were almost known .
so , she runs to the house and search after paper and the poem drive through them and she &apos;s just driving a pen as it &apos;s through it through the stone and then -- she was like it was , and they get it to get it .
they caught the poem on his tail and he pulled it back into their body and took it on the sheet of paper .
and this opportunities came to the poem , and intact on paper -- but backwards -- the last word for the first word .
when i heard that , i was a little bit of the way that i was going to be a little bit of the way that my creative process is happening .
that &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a very reactive . to work with work , i have to stand up every day , and i &apos;m going to be able to fight and really uncomfortable , and really uncomfortable .
but even i have this thing in my favorite room sometimes .
and i guess that many of you have done that .
even i had work or ideas that made out of a source of me that i really can &apos;t identify .
what is this thing for a thing ?
and how do we get to lose our minds without losing our minds , but even to keep us in the opposite of mental health ?
for me , the best living example of how to do this is the musicians tom , and i had to interview him a few years ago for a magazine .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of the time of his life was tom the embodiment of modern artist who tried to do this , and that &apos;s what they were trying to do with them , and with them .
but then he became older and quiet . he told me that he was going to go on a board of a scar in los angeles . and it changed everything for him .
he went to high speed as he suddenly hears a little puppy of a melody that is often , as it &apos;s often , for a hard , hard thing , and he wants to have it . it &apos;s a little bit of a time , but it &apos;s not going to be a way it &apos;s going to be . it &apos;s not going to be a way . he &apos;s going to be a little bit of it . he &apos;s not going to be able to do it . he &apos;s not going to be able
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper ; he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil .
so he starts , this old , old , like i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of getting to panic , he just heard .
he finished all the train and did something completely new .
he just looked at the sky and said , &quot; well , you can &apos;t see that i &apos;m going to go to car ? &quot;
so , i see this as a song , i &apos;m just going to write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a moment , if i can take care of you .
if not , you &apos;re going to be somebody else .
go and the gymnosophist cohen cohen .
his whole process has changed after it .
not the work itself . that was often so dark as the way that we &apos;ve ever got and ever .
but the process and the heavy , the heavy , which is the most powerful , was taken out when he took the genius out of where he was not doing a musician and then he came up with where he was going to come out . he realized that it had no more a more powerful thing .
it could be a very scary , surprising , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the weird , including the thing that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit of the way i worked and it has been saved .
this idea saved me as i was in the middle of the world &apos;s middle of the world &apos;s office , and i was in the middle of the world &apos;s office , and i fell in one of these most prolific of doubt in the one of these things that we all fall , when we work on something and not work . you start thinking that it &apos;s going to be a disaster .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just be able to do this project .
but then i remembered how tom had spoken in the free sky and i tried it .
so i took my view of the manuscript and i spoke my comment in the direction of a blank corner of the room .
i talked about it , and i &apos;m talking to you , you know , you and i know both , if this book is not brilliant that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i have everything i have , investing . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to tag up here and follow your percentage of the deal .
okay . but , if you don &apos;t do that ... you know what , then you know what the hell is .
i &apos;m going to go further , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you a record that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like follows . centuries have been in the deserts of the deserts , and the people who were raised for the deserts , and the music was raised for hours -- until the dawn .
these strong were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , and again , very rare , something special happened . one of the actors was actually a lot of the time .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you all have seen a performance of this performance .
it was as if the time was the time , and the dancers through a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a little bit of a time , and it did nothing else . but everything added together .
and suddenly he didn &apos;t seem to be in human .
he was shining by inside and down from the bottom and it &apos;s going to be a more powerful fire .
as something that happened to the people , people knew what this was . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : the alibi , the alibi , the educational , god , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historical , as the most important thing came from , they took this need to be able to do this . the national missile campaign changed in the north of the centuries of the centuries of the world &apos;s disease , and the tutoring , the world &apos;s disease , is the most powerful , the most powerful , which is still going to be in the same way .
if a professional in spain , something magical has done , a magical , a little bit of magic , the most magical , the , the , the , the , the , the , is , , well , , a glimpse of god , is a glimpse of god .
and that &apos;s great because we need this .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning when the dancers itself , and you see that 11 o &apos;clock is at a tuesday -- and it &apos;s not a more powerful one of god in the way .
he &apos;s just a aging of the knee with the knee , and maybe he will never get back to these heights .
and maybe someone will call god &apos;s name , if he turns out . but what would he do with the rest of his life ?
this is hard .
this is one of the most powerful of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite like the first of the very pessimistic , if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence is coming from you .
if you might just believe that you &apos;re a loan -- from a spectacular source for a time of your life , which is passed on somebody else if you &apos;re done with it .
if we start , it changes all of this .
so i started thinking and so i think with security in the past months , while i worked on the book , that &apos;s going to be a little bit of the dangerous , scary , scary , very expected to my favorite , very expected to my favorite success .
what i &apos;ve been saying is , i have to say , if i &apos;m going to be crazy about it , it &apos;s not fear .
not a lot of a sudden .
do your job .
and it &apos;s still for your contribution , whatever he might be .
if your job is dance , dance .
if the dumb divine genius , that &apos;s asked to be a little bit of a moment , to show a little bit of miracles , and then you &apos;re going to be a very short moment of miracles , and then you &apos;re going to be able to show the question of the question .
and if not , dance your dance .
and the most powerful thing !
i think and i feel that we should be teaching that .
and the most powerful thing ! the most important thing for you , despite you , just that you &apos;re just the mere human love and the most powerful , for that .
thank you .
thank you .
and the most powerful !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic is the same for nearly three million years , the size of the lower 48 states , to be 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t push a lot of enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic is the boat of the heart of our global heart system .
she grows in winter and it &apos;s in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a more powerful thing in the last 25 years .
the most important thing is with red .
as you see , it grows on the dark , this is the annual ice in winter ; and it &apos;s the summer in summer .
this is called the so-called , five years old or older , almost like blood , which is from the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here .
this is a problem , because warming is the frozen reason to get the arctic ocean in the arctic ocean , where there are big amounts of carbon , which is when he &apos;s going to be done , from microbes .
compared to the whole amount of data in the atmosphere , that &apos;s the amount of time , that &apos;s the amount of time , if we cross this critical point .
today , in some flat lakes in alaska , in a flat lakes of itself , methane is from the water .
professor &apos;s university of university in alaska is to another group of a different flat lake last winter .
wow !
you &apos;re good . the question is , how will it be us .
and one reason is , this enormous heat of greenland is the north of greenland .
this is a year of a year .
but the volume are much bigger than ever before .
this is the main river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the sea level goes through the sea level , you &apos;re going to be in the ocean .
these rivers take fast .
the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest largest world &apos;s largest thing on the planet .
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent has a negative , a negative .
and the most important thing that came out of a few of the things that came out of a few of the things is particularly strong in the melt .
this is 20 feet sea level , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the most popular , you see new lakes , you see new lakes that were a few years ago .
40 percent of all people on the world get half of their own food of this .
in the &apos; 80s , this glacier is the most powerful for this city .
the most popular thing is , they have expanding .
but if you &apos;re going to get a lot of water , most of the water is going to be cut .
in california , a 40 percent reduction was seen by the sierra .
this is the most important thing .
and the predictions , how they read them , are serious .
this is the whole world in the world , to a dramatic increase .
and the disasters everywhere in the world have actually been in a really powerful and before , and before never .
four times in the last 30 years as in the world &apos;s world .
this is a completely powerful thing .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s going to be .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 produced every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons every day in the oceans .
look at the area of eastern pacific , the american continent , north america , and the indian continent of the indian , where there is a radical decline of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest one of the world &apos;s global warming for deforestation , next to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning by fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most cooperative problem .
the united states is one of the two largest largest largest largest largest ones , together with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot more of the other things .
but we start to see a change .
here &apos;s the ones that were taken in the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the most popular and the most powerful one of the dollars , spent a dollar last single time to promote clean coal , which is already a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me something .
and to christmas , at home , at home in tennessee , a billion tons of water .
they saw it in the news .
this is in our entire country of the world &apos;s country .
this happened to christmas .
one of the ads of the world &apos;s sauce is that .
the most powerful thing is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
there &apos;s a lot of it in skin and a lot of the city in america , and it helps our economy to grow .
and the most powerful thing is clean every day .
he &apos;s affordable and the workers remain in a lot of time and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful thing is the ladder of the head of the head of the world &apos;s head .
let me tell you one very clear . al gore , nancy , harry , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection has been called two lives in life .
this is one of them .
in the most important , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
so we put it on the top of the top , spend a significant kind of a significant , significant , a major amount of a way to get a more powerful thing to get the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s also good .
so , you don &apos;t worry about climate change .
leave the quiet .
and the coal coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean , clean .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean water .
and yet , the burning of coal is the most important thing for global warming , which is remarkable clean , which you see here , changes everything .
look at it exactly , this is the one today , clean .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of the national security .
america is in a crisis that the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread , which connects all of these , is our dependence on the fuel of the fuel of the dirty fuel , and the oil of oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us from this kind of thing .
the u.s.
a plan to bring america back to work , to make us safer and help the global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
and the united states is new . find more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a computer of america .
one of the fastest ways of the old ways of old , dirty fuels that are going to break our world to reduce .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to make jobs good paid to create jobs .
and the united states is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s a old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
we have to come far , and that &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start asking you to ask the time of your childhood , when you played with a little bit of time .
while you realized how to get the hands and you &apos;re going to get the hands , and you can actually make it , and you actually learned , and you can actually change problems through understanding and change the other things .
the spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the way of our interaction with real objects -- with my favorite , and my colleagues , i started to wonder , what if we would use computers , which would be if we could use computers , which is if we could use computers , which is a digital system , which is what if we could be able to do it , and they could be able to be able to do it as a digital , and they could be able to be able to do it as a digital
this question was so emotional that we decided to study the answer and developed the answer .
shortly , a little bit of a computer is a interactive computer in the size of a computer .
you can be moving with your hand , you can perceive each other , you can detect your movements and you have a screen and you have a screen .
much more importantly , are physically , why you just can get it through the stick of the hands and access to the hands of the hands .
and the most important one is an example of a new generation of the manipulation of the planet .
and if these tools are going to be physical , and a conscious awareness for their movements , and they can see each other , and the top of our own world &apos;s surface , we can start with the study of new and more powerful .
i start with some simple examples .
this is the most important thing for the most powerful , and when i put it in a direction , the video is going to be close ; when i put it in the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other true .
so if i put them next to the same , it makes their interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the , you notice that , and you can be nervous .
and they also feel their movements and the tendency .
a interesting consequence of interactions that we started to see was that we could apply everyday gestures to data as about colors , like that , as you do with fluid .
in this case , we have three more sophisticated than a computer company , and i can use it to put color into the middle of where they &apos;re going to be mixed .
if we &apos;re going to keep it out , we can do a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
there are also some nice ways of education in education like languages , math or the most powerful , where we give people the opportunity to be the fast trial and the results .
here i am ... this is a fibonacci camera i &apos;m doing with a simple kind of a simple thing .
this is a game with words that is kind of a mixture of a mixture of the kind of mixture of a mixture of the world .
basically , you get a round of round of the letter , and you &apos;re going to be able to get a little bit of a little bit of the letter , and you &apos;re trying to make words , you &apos;ll be tested about a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , it &apos;s going to be installed and you have a new kind of a new way of trying to try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and try and
thank you .
these are some children who came to the media lab , and i could move it to it , and i could get it to try and have a video of it .
they really loved it .
a interesting fact about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
everything you have to say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest , the right thing down there .
it turns out he wanted to stack the most sophisticated .
so for him , they were just a little bit of the time .
this is a interactive of a interactive .
we wanted to develop a computer company for a design system .
this is the foreign .
he can bring new characters into the scene by putting the top of the table , which shows this character .
here he &apos;s going to be the sun .
the sun goes on on the sun .
now he &apos;s going to be a blade of the scene .
the orange sank .
good work ! yeah !
by shake the most powerful and you can put it next to the characters , it can interact with the characters ...
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end and he can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example i &apos;ve been now to show you is to show it , is a more powerful for a computer that we &apos;ve developed recently and in the most powerful than sound , like a sound , the bass , bass and drums .
each other has four different variations ; you can choose what you want to use .
and you can get these notes into the sequence that you can organize in any pattern .
and you &apos;re going to be a , by just holding a more powerful one to a computer .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filter .
you connect it with a certain sound and it &apos;s then going to be a certain sound .
and then more powerful effects like speed and volume that you &apos;re doing on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s look at .
we start in the most powerful , and we &apos;re going to put this in a series of water , and they extend them a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something more drums .
and now i &apos;m going to go to the filter with the drums , so i can control the effect live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by being hacked in the pace of the pace or another direction .
and now i &apos;m going to go to the filter , and i &apos;m going to be a little bit more expression .
i can change the sequence as you &apos;re changing .
so , i don &apos;t have to plan to plan it in the front of the front , but it can be arrogant ; it &apos;s going to expand or more cut .
and finally , i can get the whole sequence of the whole sequence by running the most common .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my excitement is to develop new , new , to fit better , how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new , and some of the possibilities that we work in in our lab .
the idea i &apos;d like to give you on the way is that we &apos;re at the threshold of this new generation of the interaction to the interaction of the world , which is the information that &apos;s going to be our demands .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m very pleased to talk to you all .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m very pleased to do that .
yeah , so what should be the most important thing ?
i have to just go back to a little bit , and it &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of the modern molecular molecular biology .
i study molecular biology and i &apos;ve been doing it for a few years , and i &apos;ve been doing that because i wanted to know , because i wanted to know , and it wanted to do it especially , what i learned in studying the study of the study .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity and i wanted to get closer to the matter of the matter , so .
i think the molecular molecular biology is now talking , so generally , biotechnology , everything you count to that , synthetic biology and so on , and so on , synthetic biology and so on , so on , synthetic biology and so on , so on , synthetic biology and so on , so on , synthetic biology and so on , so on , synthetic biology and so on , so on , synthetic biology and so on , so on , synthetic biology and so on , so on , synthetic biology and so on ,
extremely important , now , very important , and much more , much more important in the future .
there &apos;s so sophisticated things like this all the genetically fundamental plants in the world .
there are craig venter in the most important , which is trying to make a lot of the time , so gas from algae .
and then there &apos;s also things that have completely been in the everyday life , which is most people not consciously consciously , for example , for example , to wash us , for 40 degrees of laundry , also genetically , genetically powerful enzymes .
and the list can continue to continue .
and so from interest , in this technology , i &apos;m going to go on to this technology .
so what now is now going to be now ?
most people know the most people from the most powerful .
computers are going to be , and then it &apos;s always going to be like this , yes , the hackers break somewhere and claws and so on .
it &apos;s kind of a very sad thing for the most sad , because it doesn &apos;t mean what it actually has to do , and what &apos;s actually about it .
and that &apos;s the most important , in the &apos; 70s , and the &apos; 70s , and it &apos;s also made the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a social problem , which is what things are simplify , so a single one , and how can you do that differently or how can you do that differently or how can you do that differently or how you can do that differently or how you can do that differently or how you can do that differently or how you can do that differently or how you can do that differently or how you can do
and it &apos;s just a software of software , but there &apos;s also a lot of the time in the world , there &apos;s a whole kind of a whole kind of a whole kind of a whole bit of the things that are doing with the whole kinds of things .
and now , just in terms of biology , and i want to do this metaphor , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on from synthetic biology , take that biology is actually a more powerful code , because , the most powerful code is a abstract code , which is it , it &apos;s not quite the same as computers , and it &apos;s not just the same thing .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program it and you can also do it , and you can also get it to be a lot of amazing , and i thought i was incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper with it .
that &apos;s actually just a lot of a lot of time , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been doing , these networks .
there &apos;s a lot of the time that &apos;s the wild , which is originally from switzerland , that &apos;s the in the pakistan , and with cooperation , in india , but the active people in india , but now , the active people everywhere have been on the world .
that &apos;s a more artistic view , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and philosophers with scientists with scientists , and to ask the creative , and to process the creative , and the creative , and it &apos;s the creative , and it &apos;s all possible .
but it &apos;s actually about finding a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a profound deal with this .
and then there &apos;s a little bit of the wild , and then there &apos;s a lot of water .
this is from the most powerful , which is actually more like a forum where you &apos;re going to be able to get yourself and talk online .
these are a little bit of technical and a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit .
and based on these networks that have done all the popular popular , and it &apos;s been developed as a scene that i want to do .
here in the right , you see the top of the left , which is a kind of a computer , so basically a kind of school , a private school , a nonprofit club , where everyone can get .
children , old , all sorts of people , and they &apos;re just going to be able to do it , they have a lab , and look at what can you do when these are the most powerful ones .
here &apos;s a group on the bottom of indonesia , and it &apos;s called the one that &apos;s already quite long .
and longer than these other two networks .
and the way that we &apos;re in a artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , also , and combine that on quite a way of doing it .
a group of azerbaijan that i met a while ago , which is a little bit of a time that would be able to give the public to the public , which is what they &apos;re learning in college , and they tried to explain what &apos;s going on .
and i have a lecture on the other picture in copenhagen in copenhagen in the medical museum in the field of a show .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s mostly a young boy , but the only thing that &apos;s actually all the united states is that these fascination are in technology .
and what you can do with this and also very much to the society , and to ask , so , okay , what do you want to do , you know , what do you want to do with that ?
so , okay , to do biology now , you need to kind of material .
you need biological materials , and you need tools , but it &apos;s also a lab , and that &apos;s a lab .
and you can normally understand what you &apos;re normally understanding of a lab that &apos;s kind of kind of a kind of a little bit of the machines , extremely expensive , extremely expensive , just for a lot of the time , trained academics with a ph.d. and so on .
and our approach was to say , okay , that actually you don &apos;t have to do that .
that &apos;s not necessary because every one of every single one has actually developed technology as most of the time , that &apos;s really like most of the time that is really like most of the time .
and the o word with this premise has been trying to be in the morning brian , and then brian &apos;s trying to put a , and then put a more powerful , and then , a more powerful , and , and then , it &apos;s been grown , and then , it &apos;s been grown bacteria , and then it &apos;s going to be able to do bacteria .
so every one that &apos;s already a soup of soup that he &apos;s left to long , also made .
i &apos;ve tried to go home in my lab , a little bit of scale , and then i &apos;ve taken a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of a time , and i &apos;m trying to do a little bit of a look at the point of the day , so that &apos;s how to go home , so that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s actually not going to be a joke , but it &apos;s not going to be .
here &apos;s what &apos;s going on in the picture , you see the lab , in the middle of the world , so this is a kind of a computer garage with also so much more sophisticated , which has the university of the university , which is what &apos;s going on , and also quite interesting things , and also quite interesting things , and also quite interesting things , and also quite interesting things , and also quite interesting things , and also quite interesting things , and also quite interesting things , and also quite interesting things
and this is a little bit of a little bit of the time that &apos;s also mentioned , that &apos;s a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a molecular biology .
and yes , so you see it &apos;s relatively diverse , so that &apos;s the very diverse , so that &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s going to be going home to go home , until the big organizations are going to be able to do that in the form of the form .
but always the approach that it &apos;s just going to be , and it &apos;s going to be accessible .
the first project we &apos;ve done as an international group when we were aware of our self , okay , there are now here as real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we know that people who are always going to be able to be able to do that and so forth .
and then , in the world , the founder of the founder of the founder , and i said , well , we have to really meet ourselves , also really meet , and then , it &apos;s organized two events , and then , in san francisco , in san francisco , and shortly in the northern , in san francisco .
and then , there &apos;s also about that , yeah , who are we , what do we want to do , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values and what are our own , our foundation ?
and then we &apos;ve been doing a kind of a computer company .
that was quite intuitive , so everybody has just been like this , and that &apos;s what it moves , and what it moves , then , then .
there was , i think , a very good code .
and then we have not a mess , but that &apos;s not a , i think , i &apos;ve got relatively good , which people are right now , the people are quite convinced .
and we even tried to do that in the academic world , but it &apos;s kind of not that way .
so i think we &apos;re actually in the way that we &apos;re actually going to be a step further than the academic world .
yeah , what are we doing now ?
a project i &apos;ve done with the most popular in switzerland , was that we wanted to make a kind of optical case or optical loneliness .
that &apos;s when you focus on a beam of a beam on one in the room , you can capture little particles in the air or in the liquid and then move into this focus , so , as a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a
it really works , that &apos;s done in academic , and we thought , well , we might have thought , you might have taken a webcam , then you took a webcam that &apos;s going to be the lens , which is a the lens , which is increasing about the lens .
this is what you see down there .
and then we have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the laser and the pins , and then trying to focus on this camera .
and that &apos;s not what unfortunately , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of it .
so another project that from the french group of paris , that &apos;s a lot of cool , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and it &apos;s a thing that he &apos;s doing , so a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a bit of a time , and so it &apos;s a little bit of a bit of a time , and it &apos;s a lot of a time , his own , his favorite , his favorite is sam .
he &apos;s got this helmet , and it &apos;s built in cooperation with the museum , and in cooperation with the museum .
and then the visitors were going to go into the room , and they put it on this chair , and they put this helmet .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought , or how they thought , is different lights in the room .
was a pretty nice project .
another thing from the united states , which is also to do with this kind of thing , is the most important , that &apos;s the decline , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , to reproduce , to reproduce , to reproduce , so you can make them visible .
so if i do that , the most important thing to do is , then , they go to the scene , and then they &apos;re going to make any more sophisticated , and then they can do this method , and then they can say , okay , this hair , so .
and the machines that make something like that , they &apos;re pretty expensive that you &apos;re buying commercial , the cheapest , the cheapest , go to the cheapest euro .
and that &apos;s not in the most important , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be very much .
so this is just a application of many , which you can do with it .
and they have two of these two peaks , and they said , okay , we do easier and cheaper , and then they just have open source , so free hardware , so free hardware , and they &apos;re now the cheapest vendor , and they &apos;re now the cheapest vendor of these devices .
i think somehow six dollars or something .
but in every case , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s not a little bit of a frame of where it &apos;s going to be clear .
so it &apos;s my opinion of a very powerful hack .
a project i started to build was a very , very a lot of a time .
and the way that it is , yes , like a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a little bit of a little bit , two centimeters or something .
you invites the most powerful to the most powerful and the most powerful , and then i &apos;ve taken the most powerful , and then i &apos;ve taken the light to the light , and then then we &apos;ve taken it to light .
so the device you see there is not working .
but this is my prototype that &apos;s so much , but pretty much , that &apos;s what i looked at , so on a branch that &apos;s going to be , electronics , and pressure , and that was the pressure to get up , which was broken .
and then i took a more of the time and that &apos;s what it &apos;s been connected .
a more powerful , if you make the full power with water , the enough pressure , so i think 40 to the bar is about it .
and then you can speed the particles strong enough and then go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about the $ , or something like this , or something like this , the 50 times .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically doable .
and that &apos;s what it is , the core of the scene is just the core of the scene , and that availability of technology and the information and the information and the information is going to be involved in that more people can be involved there .
because , as the beginning , it &apos;s a very important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it , and also not a chance to make it really good .
because if you just read about it , it &apos;s not the same , as if you did it , or you saw it .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and when you can make a informed citizen in society , and you can get a lot of decisions in society , and you can get to the access to the knowledge , and to the technology .
and you have to do it and understand it to make it and understand it .
and then the most open open of the open open and citizen science .
so , you &apos;re going to be able to get a citizens in the position , just with these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s the core core of the world &apos;s core .
these are the people who have been officially officially in the website , and they &apos;re a website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and interesting is also that they &apos;re also in southeast asia .
that &apos;s what i think are there , and there are fewer people in the way that they are actually .
so i know from some , which is not put .
and these are just the wooden ones that are individual people .
partly with these kinds of things , so this places put together there .
and that &apos;s very in the beginning .
as i said , it &apos;s just started .
and the most powerful , so the most powerful , because the most popular thing in berlin was the first , the first one .
and that &apos;s a gigantic network of very good , yes , the world &apos;s whole , which is all over the world .
and we hope that we &apos;re going to be able to move out of it , and then also , very much connected , so that they can be involved in people .
and i would invite everyone to deal with it and even even even like what &apos;s trying to do .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity , and enough energy , you get there too far .
thank you very much for listening .
this was it .
yes , hello .
how do we actually work ?
this is a question that &apos;s very moved to me as a designer , but in the area of the world , in the field of user , and in the area of user , in the user .
there &apos;s about how to put people in interactive media so they can use these interactive media and create it a very much experience of experience .
and i think that the interactive media in us is the interactive media , cognitive models , so paradigm , which has been very , very long , and that we &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make it just through interactive media .
and that &apos;s very amazing because you actually believe that these are the most powerful , which you &apos;ve been doing , that the one is actually going to bring it into the future , but actually it &apos;s that the future is exactly at us , in our own roots .
what are now the most important models ?
i &apos;ve been writing four of the time , and i want to tell you about a short time .
and to get cognitive models and that &apos;s the models that we have in the 1930s .
to this kind of thing , we heard that we have basically natural relationship to ucla .
that sounds very unusual .
i &apos;m going to go back to it , and i &apos;m going to prove you to try and prove that you have a natural relationship to ucla .
the second aspect is that we &apos;ve been able to be able to talk about this kind of thing , and we &apos;re very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
and the third area , which explains actually from itself .
we all know that the interactive media of definition is , what the denial of the most famous , and what &apos;s telling us , of course , we &apos;re going to feel the most common today as normal .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of the world &apos;s place .
so , as it &apos;s with the multitasking that &apos;s actually the most natural thing in the world .
i want to show you that .
how many doors have the house where they live ?
we &apos;re not going to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen and it &apos;s going to happen to happen right now .
they go through this house , in the spirit of this house , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what you do .
they &apos;re the reality of reality and it &apos;s very without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and we &apos;re going to give you a lot of the most important reality in our own reality , and we can actually show the virtual reality in our own way , we can actually do that all the time .
and this wealth that the virtual reality is to be the reality of the reality , which has been needed to have the people in the 20th times , because they had nothing .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any more sophisticated .
they didn &apos;t have mass mass .
the only thing that had the one , her head .
and in this head , memory was going to be off .
in this head , it was a lot of time , and using this virtual images , the imagination , the imagination was also passed .
and so it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with self-expression so well .
the interesting thing about it is when i can make a little trip .
yes , that &apos;s .
the interesting thing about this is to be the human at the same time , and medium itself .
now , if you think about a piece of things .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that it has given a change .
but i &apos;m going to talk to you again .
the main tool of the world &apos;s world has been in the world .
and the priest , priests , so-called the way that we were more , to keep the other way to keep knowledge in stories .
and today we &apos;re going to depend on the stories , very strong stories .
the author of the book the book of the book , jonathan , we &apos;re still going to be a year of the day of the stories , and we still have a year of the day of stories .
that means for a child that &apos;s going to be able to do the most of the time that most of the time of the world &apos;s life has spent the most important of stories .
now we think our love is to stories that we have a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , very missing .
this is a lot further back to the cultures of the world &apos;s population .
but for me in the realm of interactive media as especially impressive , we have a se in our biological memory , which is the ability to think of the ability to think of the ability to think of it .
i brought them an example of the north koreans of the u.s. tribe .
and life lived in the world &apos;s office of british columbia .
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very powerful area , and you had to navigate , from island to the island of the island to get food .
and that &apos;s what we did with this so-called called the so-called so-called the so-called .
you might know , you might have a little bit of it , and you know , you know , the australian american american .
they have similar principles .
they have no more sophisticated , but they have used the same thing that &apos;s used to be used , or also the most powerful .
and what the interesting thing about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be represented over songs .
and the language of the language was in the way that the language was in the world .
that means you &apos;re going to be more of the sounds and about rhythm .
and this sounds and this rhythm have the geology , which is represented the topography of a region and that &apos;s what of course , that you could be able to put these songs and put it on the left , and then go back to the left and then go back to the left and then go back to the left and again .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to come from a to b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what &apos;s happening in fact ?
it &apos;s that this is what &apos;s going on .
we &apos;ve moved to this so-called so-called the so-called so-called the so-called .
it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s the book , and it &apos;s the book .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens that we have the responsibility for our memories and the own production of our individual memories .
on the book and on the picture .
so , unfortunately , we have a piece of god &apos;s a piece of the day .
liz is suddenly alien for us , and it has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous computer company on the most popular , is so far to say that these mass mass mass mass , he says the book and the picture , so not television , the internet , and so on , which is the internet , and so on , which is the internet .
let &apos;s make a little bit of a little bit .
from the most popular to the machine machine .
what has we been thinking about our thinking and on our memory ?
then the main thing is the main approach of the world &apos;s population .
and they &apos;re going to be over the centuries of the centuries of the centuries , and more and more of the time of the way that we have been in the world &apos;s process .
that means that instead of remember , we have a lot of common , far common , in mass , in mass patterns of memories that we can depend on our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more itself .
we have an abstract language .
we &apos;re not asking the thing anymore in images that are not in pictures , but we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
we &apos;ve used to that things that things happen .
and we have the most famous as a law , and there &apos;s only exceptions , like the most powerful .
what &apos;s left is the most important thing .
and still we &apos;re the most powerful as a very , very arrested .
the question is , what &apos;s going on now ?
we had the most popular thing , we had the machine machine , and we &apos;re going to go to this so-called the so-called so-called the so-called .
it sounds very much more powerful and sounds very much for science science , i know .
but these concepts of the most powerful , which brings us to this possibility back to the ability to discover our skills .
there &apos;s about jealousy , it &apos;s about the most important , it &apos;s about the way it &apos;s about the .
i want to explain this briefly a little bit .
there are technical concepts like the tncs , which means the extended reality .
so if you look at google , for example , it &apos;s a concept , which is what the virtual world is going to combine with the real world , which is called our fragments to the real world , which is the virtual , natural , natural , natural , natural , natural , natural , natural , natural .
another example is that so-called virtual reality .
so , of course , that &apos;s what of course , in the context of my talk , we may sound physically in the process , virtual worlds , very , very , very , very interested in the model of the brain .
and other example is the most important example , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond intelligent to a human .
all that needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept , snares as a real habitat .
i &apos;ve been in the degree and i hope that video works , a very , very beautiful project , that &apos;s the most beautiful project , which is the most powerful of michael , and the most powerful thing .
and the two of these are also here today .
maybe you can get up to the time that you can get to the break with the two of the project .
and this project i brought as an example of how again , as again , cognitive models are going to be starving .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
what the most powerful of course is extremely powerful and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i say , you have very likely to get a lot of people , that any people have people in front of some of the people who are in front of the hand , or they play with any of the time in the hand .
in every case , they &apos;re doing that in this .
this is a game for outside .
and that &apos;s the way that i think that i discover the world outside , so i think the real world is going to discover .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data that we produce is that we produce the real world .
i apologize that i have to make so strong .
you can tell that much better , because there &apos;s more more than it &apos;s more than it .
and it &apos;s about that i &apos;m discovering a city by looking at what places are positive or negative .
and so i get a whole different sight of a whole different sight , which is a very different impression , which i see negative and positive zones of a city and a way of a different , virtual map of a very real city .
and we can now look at this .
ah , what you can see here is a little explanation of what you see right now .
of course , these virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , is clear .
and with a kind of flashlight we can make this virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize that , my talk , and that &apos;s the sense that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve been acquired from the most powerful , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been doing from the most complex , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been doing , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do in the way that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be in you .
i &apos;ve been asked if this bag is a bag of a bag , and i &apos;m going to talk to my own .
it &apos;s not going to do it .
i &apos;m also going to get to the same thing that &apos;s inside there .
but i &apos;m going to do it just a little bit curious .
yes , kids are curious of nature , or should be curious , designers .
i &apos;m a creator from house , so i &apos;m also involved with the subject of curiosity and how the curiosity is also changing our thinking , and why we might lose curiosity and so forth .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re doing next to the actual existence as a creator .
if professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to be in the n .
and that &apos;s also what i had in the last half year .
a lot of natural user interface interface design design .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself why all the creator are going to start with so natural , and the communication of communication , interaction , and so on .
and i just think of one of these little devices , because things are always more intuitive , always natural , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually going to be , and you have to look at what &apos;s a little bit of the time , of course , what &apos;s a little bit of a time or intuitive .
and i &apos;ve been in the background of natural user , and i &apos;m in the field natural user interface , so the next generation in the way that we &apos;re doing the same generation in the relationship of the human computer in the relationship of the human being .
so i &apos;ve been busy , when what &apos;s , of course , or intuitive .
maybe you might have to look at a look at it .
why does this happen ?
so if we look at the development of our society , we &apos;re going to move to the third of the third , and we &apos;re now moving from the third of the fourth , or the most powerful .
so from modern in the world &apos;s world .
every society is shaped by a computer system .
the beginning of the language is the language .
that means you found that you &apos;ve talked to a common language , you could communicate with each other , and you &apos;ve been able to communicate in other areas , or in other areas , cities and the villages , and it &apos;s made in the way that we have a lot of time .
but the most common thing was , the language , something very natural , something very natural .
you had to learn , so not a two-digit can talk about nature , but we learn it , and we learn to be a little bit of the time and of course .
it was then made by the ancient society and the first shape of abstraction .
that was a more powerful , because of course , the living language started to minimize the living language in the form of writing , which is what &apos;s going on , and i &apos;m going to start and do it in stone and i also get it into stone and i &apos;m going to do it .
depending on how i &apos;m going to get a lot of the other , and when i &apos;m going to be a different coverage of the coverage , of course , when there &apos;s a alive of a life .
but then , the writing was just the script as a computer designer , and then he got a push .
then the next generation that we actually came in today is primarily life .
this is just the pressure of pressure and print pacific , and other people .
and then , it was a very , very much a more powerful , where the other thing , and other people said , are you actually really crazy when people start reading , then the time , and that &apos;s completely rough .
and now we come to the next generation and the exciting thing is , a little bit of a few hundred years , and we &apos;re actually in this in this way in this field of time that we &apos;re going to come to this .
and of course , the confused of course , because we see the new media , the new media , the social media , facebook , and so on .
with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what &apos;s going on on the old thinking , don &apos;t tell you that in the most violent , and no beef , or a beef , is that i &apos;m just going to be able to do that , and it &apos;s going to be a lot of time .
and these two worlds just pop together , new and old thinking .
the exciting thing about it is when you look at this , these new society , these new society , the most important , principles and the paradigm paradigm from the most popular .
but not more on local level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the theme ecology is a global global .
not if i think of locally , and the neighbor thinks less green , then it doesn &apos;t work anymore .
that means that the local village has become a global village , and of course , the same principles , but , the total transparency , but also the total transparency .
so as you knew in the village , who has what &apos;s got with who and when , that &apos;s what happens today about these extension of our self in global level .
it &apos;s that we know global representations and faster and better , and better .
so as it was just about the village , it happened to be on the village .
so before the background , i &apos;ve been doing that , what is it going to be , what is it about , what &apos;s going on for us , of course , what &apos;s going on for us , so what does it do for us , so what does the difference do ?
because often people come , they can &apos;t make it a lot of time , so everybody can deal with it .
so you have to deal with what &apos;s called , and not just just changing it , it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s going to be better .
and when of course , there &apos;s something intuitive , and as i can take a creator , and just as a creator , and just the things that they &apos;re doing is that they &apos;re a a more intuitive , so they &apos;re very intuitive , because they &apos;re fun and just use them .
you &apos;re going to be busy , as well as the 50th , with the subject of perception and the most important .
and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do , and you &apos;re going to see and look , okay , now i just look at the inside itself .
and how does it actually look like this ?
so how do we work when we &apos;re going to get there ?
and what does of course , of course , intuitive and how do we work our channels of perception and how does cognitive processing process work ?
because steve jobs said , you &apos;re going to be able to dig up to dig up to the dig up to the transplant of the world .
so you really have to look at the details when i want to make something more intuitive or intuitive , which is what it means in the core .
and you see that you &apos;re a one of our seven senses , most of you have only five , now , you &apos;re just seven , now , there &apos;s a little bit of the next , you know , the next thing is , and as an extension , it &apos;s also going to be the next , eighth sense , and as an extension of our self .
and look at how we process information , how do we take information ?
and to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that is a difference .
many of the things that are going to use , but not what it means , but then it &apos;s not what it means .
but i have to understand in the core , in the creature , when it &apos;s going to be information to information , when data is going to be information and from information , so i know how to do things also more intuitive or of course .
and of course , how design is going to take meaning to perception .
we see this , if i make things , then i can make it confusing as on the right , where i don &apos;t know what &apos;s salt and pepper , or i can actually make it intuitive by showing things .
so very much natural , it &apos;s in a head , but i see directly , where is salt and pepper in it .
and if i say someone , i &apos;ll give salt or pepper , then he &apos;s going to think about where it &apos;s what &apos;s inside .
and the left just intuitive and then hopefully , that no sugar is in there , that &apos;s the salt of salt .
but also our perception itself , as it &apos;s also , as it &apos;s .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the little , although it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just just just as big as the context , and yet , our perception , depending on what context we &apos;re doing .
anybody know what that is ?
and the bottom line .
and the most important thing is , it should work .
there &apos;s already more than my glasses .
so it &apos;s the n circle .
a second circle starts to be a little bit more accurate or to associate .
and if i &apos;m going to take a more powerful , then we don &apos;t see a unit of a unit , which is a circle , which is circle , circle and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle , a circle
and it &apos;s called the most powerful or just a little bit of the time that we &apos;re going to be influenced by the perception of the perception .
so , for the creator that have most of the time in the first semester , the great thing .
and the close one of the continuity of the continuity and so on .
and then , in the third , again , again , forget .
but that &apos;s an essential part of that , if you &apos;re going to be able to make things like that .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting , is the view of the view .
sounds very unpredictable , but it &apos;s very exciting when you &apos;re busy .
so we have the eyes and now think we &apos;re looking at the back of the back .
this is wrong .
you see , in the back of the back , it &apos;s going to go back .
because it &apos;s a assumption to the front that you see something you see , you see what you see , the circle of the circle .
that means we &apos;re just seeing our see , before we see it , that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing again in our back of our own , to say , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay
i have this cognitive design system , you have what you want to see .
that &apos;s also there , that &apos;s again coming back .
then it goes back to the front , because the back is not the back , and it &apos;s going to say now , and now , look at it , and you &apos;re going to go out , whether that , what you want to see , that &apos;s what you want to see .
and then it &apos;s going to go back to the back and then it &apos;s just seen .
so a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very .
i don &apos;t know who from you know this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve described .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what &apos;s seeing .
does anybody see something specific ?
a computer system , right .
if i saw that , that &apos;s a little bit of a computer that &apos;s a little bit of a time in there , you know that .
they &apos;re never going to forget , because i &apos;m going to show you where the most important thing is .
now you see the most powerful .
and on , now you see it .
that means i actually stopped it now that they don &apos;t see any pattern of the pattern , but i &apos;ve been in a short time , and i &apos;ve always been in a short time , and again , this dog in this setting picture .
and this is the projection of the view of the view , and it &apos;s going to see .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m going to go back to the front that i see the most powerful .
i see the most powerful .
so , very exciting processes that then , in this , yes , gray is actually not , but here &apos;s what &apos;s going on in this kind of field of mass .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
this is our present .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as designers .
if i know something three seconds , until i kind of , i can actually see the present in the world &apos;s present , and i can also bridge it very well in the way that i &apos;m going to be able to do it with three seconds .
it &apos;s just going to process it as a present .
and then it &apos;s going to go into the past and so i can bridge very elegant to the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
what takes the milliseconds of milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
also , a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time that you love in love .
that means , if you know that , you know , you know , you know , who you look at how long , because i &apos;m not going to get a gun for what &apos;s going on .
and 16 milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time of most perceptions that we have .
that &apos;s what happens , this first impression is happening in a fast fast speed , as we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we &apos;re kind of like our environment , so we can think about this .
of course , the creator are not just dealing with the subject of perceptions and neural , but naturally of course with the subject of the world &apos;s subject .
so like a human being , a human being about it .
there &apos;s a little bit of the practical functions , so that &apos;s what the basic features , or the things that are going on .
there are a lot of the time where i know exactly where i have to reach .
but there are also symbolic functions , why are somebody for such a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the time , where it &apos;s not what &apos;s going on , even as well as it &apos;s not so practical ?
there are more likely to be on the symbolic , which we &apos;re going to be able to do as a creator of course .
back to my actual topic natural user , and the theme of what of course , is the subject of the thing that &apos;s also a lot of time .
and it always means how can i get a certain goal to get a certain goal or how can a user make a user in a certain kind of conceptual , efficient and the other thing .
so it &apos;s more the norm that &apos;s going to say .
how can i make something like this ?
i can use this directly , or i need to take the n manual or i need to be training for training .
and less , or more powerful , it &apos;s .
that i &apos;m just making it different and beautiful , it doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you also have to understand that .
and if you &apos;re looking at the software that we &apos;ve seen , you &apos;ll see , then you &apos;ll understand why 99 percent of our software is little intuitive or not on the way that it &apos;s very intuitive , and it &apos;s locked in a lot of the way that it &apos;s , even though it &apos;s a classic software .
it &apos;s not just a fundamental thing for apple &apos;s oil , and it &apos;s a fundamental thing to do , and the fundamental thing is , if i want to make technological devices in people .
why ?
because in the rule of the rule , we &apos;re going to be the natural user , so the natural user , for example , five times faster in the average .
they have to imagine that if they make something of classical , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , just one hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you can probably go home four hours , but your employer or someone is going to be a , like he &apos;s busy with the four hours .
but i want to say that it &apos;s a way to make a lot of things , and also to make certain things .
and then if we go back to the area of software , this is the first the first line of interfaces that were very abstract , where you needed months to deal with these systems .
then the next one that &apos;s already going to be with the mile of the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the metaphor of a desktop , &quot; which is the metaphor of a desktop to make the metaphor of a desktop to make the computer .
so not more zeros and the ones or the ones or a metaphor , but just a metaphor .
this was a lot of the way that it was a lot of the time , but it &apos;s also much better .
the next generation of the commons is working very much more with behavior .
so i &apos;m going to create a very much more often the behavior as a lot more than that .
this is also a paradigm paradigm .
that i &apos;m going to look at this , and that &apos;s what the most important thing is to be the success of the success .
and if i have a step of a step of the natural user , where i &apos;m in the natural user , where i was about voice , by the language , by touch , by the gesture and the cursor , and then i have to drive the things that have to drive .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do again , and then when things are going to be more intuitive ?
if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to get a little bit of my little friend here , and look at what does that mean , because it &apos;s really a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of intuitive ?
and that &apos;s for us , and it &apos;s always a bit intuitive when i have to think about it .
so he doesn &apos;t want to think , but it &apos;s just going to be able to do it .
the less i think about it , the more more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for designers ?
that means that if we can see that we can transmit existing of a little bit of a different thing to do , for example , the metaphor , i can do that as a creator .
that means i can just transmit a intuitive human being on a software and make the software much more powerful .
and of course , the question of what &apos;s actually the most important thing about us is that the most important thing is that we &apos;ve been saying .
this is called the so-called the so-called .
it &apos;s using each of us and the most powerful , and it &apos;s an acronym , and it &apos;s a legitimate , and it &apos;s a marketer , and it &apos;s a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
it &apos;s all the time that everybody &apos;s all the time , but it &apos;s kind of intuitive and it &apos;s kind of intuitive or partly .
the model is going to be a lot of the time in the womb , and it &apos;s a lot of time in the womb , so it works in the world , and it &apos;s going to be used by us , and it &apos;s used by us all the time , without most that most of the time , that this model is there .
and the most important thing about 50 to 50 times is about 50 to the time of the activity , so in sleep , you &apos;ve found that it &apos;s going to be less often than the day .
i can now be able to get this mental energy system , and i &apos;m going to be able to transmit the mental , and i &apos;m going to be able to transmit it to a more powerful .
and by the way , the transmission of the transmission , like the metaphor of the most important , but not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a computer system , a computer .
and that &apos;s on a higher grail of the world &apos;s transmission as the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the primary metaphor .
and if i &apos;m going to get this , for example , in the way i &apos;m going to be a picture of a picture , as a choice , as a choice , it &apos;s going to be a big thing to me , and i can see it , and i can go to the details , and i can go to the same , and i can go to the , and you can go to the , and you can go to the , and you can go to the , and you can go to
then i can transmit the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to do this by an example .
and it &apos;s just a cake .
so , i &apos;m going to interact with the object , and i can actually get out of the object , and then it &apos;s going to turn out .
i &apos;m going to get the whole picture of the whole , now , can filter , and can tell me , just to be all of the things with chocolate .
and once a interface , what &apos;s much more intuitive and very much more natural .
because , i can reach the things like the pieces of the pieces , and you can get to me , and you &apos;re going to get a lot of natural than if you can do it about the insula , and you can make it available .
imagination is more powerful , and it &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of the time , and with this sentence , i &apos;d like to close , a and to give you a little bit of the evidence , and to give you a little bit of the evidence , and thank you very much for your attention , and you &apos;re going to be quite excited about your attention and please .
i want to help you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first one , when you &apos;re going to become a child , as a baby , is that you &apos;re going to take care of what the most important you have , you know , yes ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed you to play more or less in the most violent , and to move the more , and to move the more , and to move the more , and to move the more , and to move the more , and to move the more , and to move the more , and
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
so , all of that , these are , and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m going to do this , basically , that whole kind of thing , the whole thing , 40 years of the quality of the quality , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point of this .
and that depends on phosphorus .
give a chance .
every day they give them a + of scale , and they have to take a little bit of phosphorus phosphorus , and every day they have to take two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only be a the ultimate line of the world &apos;s favorite .
if we don &apos;t have phosphorus , and they &apos;re not going to get a phosphorus .
amazingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re going to do something like this , which is actually a little bit of a time , but not that way .
because all of the time about energy , but nobody talks about the most important .
the most important thing is much critical .
we depend on two countries .
we just have phosphorus , and now , by the world &apos;s world , it &apos;s going to be a lot more uranium in the world , and we &apos;re going to be able to be able to get a lot more uranium in the environment than in all the nuclear business .
in the last 20 years , the tons of tons of uranium have been distributed in germany in germany .
and that &apos;s what we take all .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little bit less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , the environment , go less car .
the environment , make less waste .
the environment , the environment , less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
this is like i would say , &quot; you know , your child , you just get three times rather than five .
this is just a little less destruction .
if we think of the dodo , we think of the world &apos;s most important , and then our whole earth used to be used to the earth or later .
so , that &apos;s what the dodo of the dodo to think about .
and the most important thing about that is to look at the ground as first .
in the ground , over 60 percent of the world &apos;s population is stored .
we &apos;re building corn and we lose corn and 30 pounds of 30 pounds per hectare , or in the square square feet , and also the square .
that means we lose over five times more than new , as new .
we can see that , of course , the most important thing .
and everything is packaging or content .
for example , in the most important 20 percent of the most popular 20 percent of the world &apos;s population , the most powerful .
and because we &apos;re older , it will be bigger .
it &apos;s kind of all in the most violent .
yes ?
one baby takes about six percent of them .
we could reduce that for 10 percent , but what does this do ?
this is going to be balanced in china in a second .
this is completely inevitably hurt .
so the question is , how do we go to these dating ?
here &apos;s one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be emitted to the pigs over the very solid components .
in the people over the urine .
yes .
so , with that , men can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , right ?
traditionally , we think in the most violent , we &apos;re too many on the world .
and if you &apos;re going to get the people if you &apos;re going to exist the people , if you say that , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you &apos;re going to be there , and you &apos;re not going to get it to the , and you &apos;re going to be able to get it .
and so someone says , as al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more of the human beings , and there &apos;s nothing more of the human population .
in israel , you say , if you &apos;re a living , you &apos;re going to be the earth .
here &apos;s what it says , the more you &apos;re going to be the better .
yes .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh about four more than we are people .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , nobody may be termites , so far , even though they &apos;re a vegetarian .
that means the ants weigh much more than we .
and because they &apos;re physically working much harder than we &apos;re and because they &apos;re only three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in the energy consumption , in the energy consumption , something 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you &apos;re seeing how far we &apos;re going to do that , what we really wanted to do and how sad we are , and how sad we are in the earth , you can see that for example , you can see that for example , you can see a program , until 20 , you want to be here to be a program , and you can see it , for example , that &apos;s a program , until 20 , you want to be here , and you can be here to be a program
you can only be a little bit of the time if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
did you see a little bit of a tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be a little bit of a trees , yes ?
yes ?
no tree is a tree .
luckily , not , yes ?
there &apos;s no more a more of the trees .
there are still six billion trees alone .
so , you &apos;ve heard something about the trees of trees ?
that means all our intelligence means that we want to be a little bit of a trees .
and where you see , even like the achilles , the biological biological , agriculture , don &apos;t allow us to go back to our own own own .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus phosphorus that really have to go back into the galapagos .
and so we &apos;re too many .
alone .
that &apos;s what we feel so guilty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no more a more , no more , no , no , no , no , no , no , no one , and how they all are called the way that we &apos;re going to get our own credibility .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , which is oil oil .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it comes to the environment , it &apos;s the highest , not to be there , yes ?
and , yes ?
you can only have a little bit of the time when you &apos;re not there .
even if you &apos;re going to shoot yourself , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can get our nutrients back .
we &apos;re doing agriculture in brazil where we &apos;re going to go back to nutrients .
we can be able to be able to get nutrients in the way that we can do it in agriculture .
we do that in china , for example , where we &apos;re going to take the waste of it .
in china , a more powerful one is still a more powerful , sort of , yes ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid , our nutrients .
that means that all western the western world &apos;s population is that the city has always taken , but the farmers never have a little back .
so , this is the cities growing more , because the farmers were going to go to cities and they had to keep the cities on their nutrients .
so all the western rich are always expanding until they didn &apos;t have done the infrastructure and then they &apos;re a state of state .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done a lot of civilization about five years , because you &apos;ve always been able to get nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat in china , you expect to be the food that you &apos;re going to stay as long until you look at the toilet .
because it &apos;s a curved , and the nutrients are taking .
you have her to eat them , not to the food .
that means you can see the internet in the internet , as you can get the nutrients back .
it &apos;s actually beautiful , if you do that , so agriculture makes , agile , to a hectare of land with five people in favelas , can be a farmer about a dollar , and the plant and the chicken and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and vegetables and
and the great thing about this is that the most important in the favelas are coming back over over 90 percent .
so we don &apos;t need to control people , rather bad .
we can support them , to be good .
that &apos;s of course , of course , but the facilities are wearing themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re so designed by designing the design that can just manage a farmer .
that means that the most powerful thing is coming back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve built over the last 20 years , not from these facilities , ever , of these facilities ever .
you could just just have a liter of a liter of a liter of a liter and then the plant would be reduced to years .
don &apos;t find instead .
that means we don &apos;t need to control people , rather bad .
we can support them , to be good .
that means we need to be phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you &apos;re going to be able to be in germany , in germany , in the best way .
unfortunately , not in the world , but maybe you can help the most important thing to do .
because the most important facility could be best the phosphorus back .
and the back has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s not going to be possible .
we &apos;ve been used to holland now about three years .
the dutch government explains it , they will be the first country in the world , which phosphorus is going to be .
but we need this .
you understand , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
there &apos;s an airstrip of a bunch of plastic .
these are the countries who control 40 percent of the world &apos;s 40 percent of the world &apos;s population .
and the oil is going to replace us through other energy fuel .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace .
it &apos;s not about making the existing one little bit less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s all about asking what the right is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
in holland , you understand that , of course , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if for example , your wife is sad when you have it , and you get to 50 , and you get 50 of them .
completely inefficient .
but actually , it &apos;s effective , yes ?
or take a more an 11-year-old .
a woman in germany eats about six millimeters of three kilograms of their life .
and in this .
this is not exactly correct , because we don &apos;t know how much more powerful is going to be .
but a more straightforward , even at that lighting , i can tell you , is it completely inefficient , but it &apos;s actually effective , yes ?
a whole thing in life is not efficient .
that &apos;s not why it &apos;s going to be solar efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask what is the right ?
not , the most important thing to burn a little bit better and it &apos;s going to be a little bit more and more and more and more and more , and to lose the whole materials for the strings , but first of all , how do you do the boxes ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i &apos;m going to dinner , and i say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with a little bit of water and a glass of water .
wonderful , &quot; ?
this is efficient .
everything in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything that counts in life is not to save it , to avoid .
the whole thing .
we say the people , oh , you don &apos;t have green in the south .
no , that &apos;s exactly the right thing that it &apos;s right ?
every one of where you &apos;re going to be a little bit of the time , yes , you &apos;re doing it again .
but the wrong things .
if you &apos;re the wrong things , you have a more powerful thing .
in like we think from north .
there &apos;s any footprint .
if you walk , yes , everyone destroyed the ground .
because the ground is going to die , and the the wind and the wind is going to take the ground away .
but if you &apos;re in italy , everyone means the carbon &apos;s water is longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that &apos;s going to be a portfolio .
not the most important .
we say in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask you how to do it with your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , &quot; well , do i say , &quot; well , do you say , &quot; well ?
this is just the minimum .
so not saving , prevent .
every waste is essential .
and it &apos;s a sense of if you see in italy , like people in the high bow , so that the people in the high bow is going to go out of the car .
because you know , this is a kind of a process of a process .
it &apos;s a form of the form of the form , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a more powerful , which is in temperature room .
you can throw it out where you go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re building all over .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they &apos;re doing the taliban to the biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so it &apos;s two strings .
not all of the time of course is to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
a television or a washing machine , you can just use it , you don &apos;t use it .
just the things that the most powerful , like the most powerful , like the way that they have to be , like the way that they have to be in biological systems .
things that are used only , go into technical systems .
but today we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the most important thing , yes ?
very direct ads , and it &apos;s not for the company of venezuela , but that they &apos;re now helping that business , and they &apos;re going to help that business .
because we don &apos;t do things more free .
yes ?
so , if i &apos;m going to eat them , and i say that &apos;s free from the food , then you don &apos;t help that .
no , we &apos;re stuck with what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like the way that we &apos;re .
not toxic in .
but everything in this is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can put on the top of the street , and the rubber in biological fields can go , right ?
everything is a ticket of it .
and if it &apos;s going to be us , of course , it &apos;s going to be a problem for the latter , for nike , for the world , and the whole industry with the entire industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the most sophisticated world , which is caused by the textile industry .
so , you can help , ask you to ask people .
hey , ecstasy , do you really do it seriously ?
because now , because they &apos;ve been changing twice the most powerful .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really really get a lot of time .
so , help me a little bit .
but it &apos;s .
yes .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been shown about .
this is .
we can do things so that they &apos;re going to be if they &apos;re going to break up , if they &apos;re breaking , they can be in biological fields .
technical metric is the same .
there &apos;s this a direct amount of energy .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , that &apos;s done in the cycle .
and that &apos;s what you can do in every store , you can do things .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the wmap time ?
when it &apos;s the waste .
all over these are these teas around , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there &apos;s the way on the top of the world , but also in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastics , it can go into biological systems , if we change the most important , in the inside , that they can just go back to the street , and they can be in tunisia , and in tunisia , they can be in tunisia .
yes ?
and if you take these intersections , you &apos;re going to take it , you can take it , and you &apos;re taking it to the powder , and the powder to plant trees .
so this is the baby &apos;s baby for the whole life , from beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be a little bit of the time , we can be more powerful .
it &apos;s kind of a kind of a more powerful print .
yes , sort of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can do everything still .
i started a institute .
now , there are many people working in the way they &apos;re all involved in .
there &apos;s extra a computer company that &apos;s going to be a team of the world .
so not more saving , prevent , avoid , reduce , not a computer , but intelligent waste .
does it make it curious ?
thank you .
the work of the most important .
music as language .
in the description of my talk , i wrote that i was as a computer designer , so i &apos;m going to understand as a computer designer , so in english , you understand .
and the written notes are the written notes in the very recent music .
that you don &apos;t just put a word for the word of the text in a different language , but also the deeper sense of words and the more common sense of words and the other sense of words , everybody who has to do it with the most powerful translation .
and in the english english , it can require more knowledge , and it can require it if you go to poetry or anything about poetry .
but very alien is it for a year , which we do with our own .
as a computer scientist , i first have the written notes .
you think that the composer in the notes has all the time that he has imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and a standstill .
these notes are about just right or a benign , as a verbal , as well as a very seemingly , very clear , description of a landscape .
because in this verbal , the smell of flowers is not smell to smell the degree of the world &apos;s land , which is not to hear the way that the most powerful of the computer is not to hear .
that means the consumer &apos;s security needs to be the most powerful thing in a different , which is a different , concrete , glucose , robotic , soap .
today i want to tell you what i &apos;m going to translate to the musical , so , even in a verbal language , again , in a verbal language .
so basically , a translation of translation .
so i put it on the whole thing , and i &apos;m going to be able to do it , because if i have to translate it back to english , it would be a little bit of the translation of translation in translation .
so the music works for me as much as the spoken language .
the main notes have the function of the letters of a script .
so it doesn &apos;t take to learn just grades and the key to the piano or the right place on a computer system .
because that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the sense of letters you can only see when you can do the language .
so , you need to do the music of music in the same as long as the spoken language .
there &apos;s also a shower , whether you learn it for the most powerful , just passive or you can talk to the musical speakers , until the musical speakers .
the work of the most important thing is that the most important thing about the one of the most powerful .
after you first chose a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re going to be able to be able to get to the origin of the composition of the composition .
you &apos;re going to be able to be information about the piece in the world &apos;s office .
you read in the letters , and you &apos;re reading notes , or whether it words , thoughts of composers itself .
you studied the work that he wrote before and after .
you compare .
the fictional , to write .
how and what did he do ?
how were his circumstances , how the society and politics ?
all of that is interested in me .
you think in this time by looking at contemporary images , or a literature .
but the time you have a rich knowledge of the time , and you know , a rich knowledge of the composers that you play more , and it &apos;s always easier to feel in it , and feel it .
the composer is always going to be more to the friend that you live together .
his cause , to write the piece , will always be more and more to my personal concerns , to play .
now , the notes are all the other way of the idea of the fellow , but only one framework , i &apos;m now going to turn this framework to make it back to meaning and meaning .
i &apos;ll say , with my own words , what could be written between this framework .
i play the game , which may have the notes to mean .
now for me , and for the composers , and what they could now mean for him today .
every tone , every phrase gets a sense , because i feel it , because it &apos;s a personal way of doing it now .
it has to be in this and now , and now , i &apos;m not going to convince my audience to convince that that &apos;s my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , that i have a lot of the way that i &apos;ve been able to experience the way that we have to experience the way to experience .
as you &apos;ve seen a happy new day , even though the same rituals of life , breakfast , breakfast , to work , i &apos;m going to go to the same piece of time , and i &apos;m going to go back to the same piece of things .
i &apos;ve become older a day , the seasons , my pulse , goes down to the morning , and it takes a time to go back to the morning , and it takes longer that sound back back as home .
i &apos;m going to breathe the audience right , and i &apos;m aware of it .
all of this affects me and all this affects my experience with the composition .
it &apos;s also wonderful , if i stand with a computer on the stage , and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , a good conversation .
you get a new idea in and you &apos;ll be able to be able to do this with a response .
it &apos;s exciting because then things that we don &apos;t have to eradicate and what you &apos;re not doing is that you can &apos;t .
it makes big fun to make music , and they have been experienced as the audience , and then they &apos;ve experienced how music is doing alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more like this moment .
i can &apos;t play today as in 20 years .
and i &apos;m going to have more life life than today and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do on my palette , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to have to have a lot more of the time in the body , and the emotions have a lot more than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some of the most powerful things , but for new indigenous .
have a nice physical example of this .
it was on a very reactive for a computer company for the most old old teacher , professor , professor , a famous , famous , a famous , famous , a famous professor of the world &apos;s office in the world .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so he was a lot of time when i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortune , it &apos;s very early , with 13 years , and i was in my school , and i &apos;ve been on my school .
i was 17 , when i went back to one of his courses once , and i played the last of the four of the time of chopin , a computer company .
he asked me what the introduction of this kind of thing was for me .
this is a part of a piece of a piece .
and i said , i said , expectation .
and he &apos;s going to be and he said , &quot; ?
this has to be the most important thing .
because for me , it means memory .
he was already over 60 .
well , with 17 , you have dreams , but not a major memories .
i play the piece of all the few years and always have it to me , although no single note has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because again , i &apos;m going to read something new .
an example of a whole different area . namaste has painted the most powerful .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different afternoon , in the same day , in the light of light .
he &apos;s translated the most powerful , as he saw them , like it &apos;s seen in this moment .
his personal health system of the most powerful .
the most precious interpretation of a piece is that it &apos;s comparable .
now i &apos;m also older than chopin with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
he &apos;s just lived in the years .
and it &apos;s important to me , and it &apos;s going to be in the notes , even though i can , you can get to it .
to keep the time , right with the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially if he died .
now , how do you start talking to the language of music ?
i said , you need to have a lot of time for the spoken language .
often the most important thing is that you &apos;re just learning the notes .
you &apos;re basically learning that , before you just talk a word .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument .
and when all the fingers in time , and it &apos;s like it &apos;s going to be moving in the notes , then sound comes out of sound that sounds like music .
if that happens , the student gets the computer &apos;s piece .
about interpretation , hardly in the most important .
well , there &apos;s a little bit of the way that it &apos;s a quick piece of time .
and the slow , slowly .
according to the , and the r and b , etc .
that &apos;s the most of you here .
but even if you &apos;re going to get this data , it still stays a bit of technical .
and it &apos;s not a interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder you often forget something very much about it .
because , that , to make music on the instrument , the own musical and feel before .
because that &apos;s the singing .
a child that doesn &apos;t learn that , because it doesn &apos;t have the parents , it will not be done by itself .
this is like the most important thing .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music to get it over another way , so to sound a tool , to sound .
people who never sing , have never felt immediately with their body , like it &apos;s , a sound .
a phrase with his own breath .
the music problem is the extension of our body .
our vocal kidneys to sing our hands and feet to dance .
so the most popular thing is the sequel of my finger .
the tune comes from the most powerful and the rhythm from the dance .
the dominant of the world today is not being avoided .
you don &apos;t need to make music more , if it &apos;s going to be boring .
not more necessary to whistle a laser or singing .
every single music will be more nuanced when you &apos;re constantly going to be a lot of the outside with music .
so , there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; well , what do you do if i can &apos;t sing ?
so , i &apos;m not going to sing , you can &apos;t sing , a , because you believe that you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to start to figure out whether they can &apos;t , or learning , or learning how to put these little muscles that are going to put the vocal cups , right .
because you can train it .
or c , because you have it to get them out of it , that they &apos;re more powerful .
i ask , how do we have the more profitable , and i was like this diagnosis ?
have you got a more powerful or a more powerful , how do you tell it beautiful today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and you want to do it also to do it .
but what i &apos;d like to do is , because music is a beautiful , a beautiful thing .
but maybe you can also do it even more .
well , you see , you know , all the cases have to be a candidate .
but you don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand anything from classical music .
i can &apos;t say if it &apos;s good or bad .
i &apos;m going to say , but sure you can tell you whether it &apos;s like you or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says , i don &apos;t know if it tastes , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t get to food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to get rid of classical music because you don &apos;t play a instrument .
listen to it , and say , if it tastes you or not .
whether the music is to be too cute or too sweet .
tell that what you feel .
and the time you get the time and you want to make a little bit more accents , or even a little bit more spongy .
why do i challenge now from my audience that it &apos;s also active ?
because the music is a language , and a language is to communicate there .
a piece of artwork you never look at , has no force to work .
the food , that was a chef or a chef , and a chef has to be eaten , and not just looked at recipes or the recipes .
so you hear , if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice thing .
if the adults are going to be active , or at least active music , a child is growing up , and then it &apos;s very easy to ask a child , to ask the color ?
can you also play me in blue ?
and the child plays , after a computer , instead of a red flower , a blue flower .
and this sounds like before .
that was the first beginning of a little musical expression .
so the first step to a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece of play today , which is a hundred , 20 , or in front of three years ago ?
now , the instruments are moving .
there was a tool in the way that we didn &apos;t even have a piano .
it was not invented yet .
i think the stream would have been thrilled when he had the dominant possibilities of today &apos;s modern health .
i can now get the most sophisticated , which had the stream , on the modern wing to sound , which is not a computer system .
and it &apos;s also about beethoven knows that he heard more than he had been deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which has a orchestra from time as a orchestra .
so the composers are dependent on us , which is the pieces that are going to reinvent the pieces .
so they &apos;re going to be hacked , which they just imagined in the spirit .
and also what you would think about today in the spirit .
or that , what i &apos;m going to do today because what you could have thought about .
thank you .
you know what is going on ?
were they more resistant to it ?
and how did that feel ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a computer .
when i come to my little deadline , and i &apos;m going to go back to my little deadline , and i &apos;m going to get this sense .
i &apos;m going to take something through the head .
i say , &quot; the &quot; n , &quot; you know , &quot; n .
it &apos;s going to lose half the time half the time .
and at all , you work much less than i .
why do i have to afford to afford this &quot; n little car ?
and then i immediately falls to one that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this awkward feeling is way .
our organism has invented a great way to make these hopeful feelings like envy .
you can try to do that with words like revenge or a little bit of a little bit of a time or a mess .
i want to explain to you with this mechanism today , or something that &apos;s likely to be able to do .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but think about it not to the lie , as you might have heard , if people say , no one has a wall to build a wall .
and then rocks , so he &apos;s going to get the view off .
and you see , you see , the liars are not thinking about what he says .
it &apos;s easy to check out that it &apos;s very different in mind .
it &apos;s just it , and it &apos;s not yourself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , that they &apos;re going to deceive themselves .
they need these lie to get a more a legitimate , to get an self-deception upright .
you can get less easily , yes , or also to move to the collapse .
they need time .
from this time , a anecdote that you might know .
the spanish painter had been given to picasso once a woman .
this woman has been able to be able to do that , the portrait would not see her .
picasso says , just wait .
it &apos;s always going to be similar .
and at that point , and if you laugh , you see how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience something , what artists can tell us about what artists can tell us .
because artists have a high relationship to lie .
the artist tells you something with , and especially this lady , which you don &apos;t see when you just look at the mirror .
the artist is going to share with a portrait of something that you &apos;re going to be familiar with when you &apos;re going to look at this piece of artwork again .
then this awkward feeling disappears , it could not be similar to you , and it &apos;s going to be similar to you .
here you have this mechanism that we can use as a great invention to the world &apos;s lie of our own invention .
and not only in art , in the way in the mythology , in the mythology , it &apos;s going to be on the mythology .
you might know that idea of the lady , which looked at every morning in the mirror and asked him who is the most beautiful in the entire country ?
one day that mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a little bit of a time .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you know , as much hostility from this true , the mirror can &apos;t lie , the mirror can &apos;t lie from this true .
but we should just do that , that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a woman somewhere else .
here it is necessary , which we understand under the most powerful , always put back .
we need this lie that &apos;s going to be the deception that we can &apos;t get to the deception of the deception .
we don &apos;t just have in art , in the most powerful , but also in science , and in science .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s story of the woman &apos;s story .
she heard about this book of charles darwin who &apos;s the emergence of the species and the ancestry of the people .
that the man should be applied to the monkeys , and yes , it was a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then they ran them to her husband and he said that &apos;s not true , which is what charles writes .
the human being is being applied by the monkeys or a common ancestor .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , we need to prevent that people are going to get to the people .
why do we have to prevent that people are going to get something from something when it &apos;s true ?
because we cannot live without these things .
because we &apos;re doing this self-deception , this feeling , great to be great , and not from a single creature , from such a kind of a kind of a kind of a organism , which has been a organism that exists to us , a rock , which is a rock , and otherwise what things that are going on is to be a rock , and otherwise what things that are going on is to be a rock , and otherwise what things that are going on is to be a rock , and otherwise what things
so , we can &apos;t do these things .
we need to prevent that people are going to get things from things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you see , how slow this mechanism is going to be falling and look like the traces that he leaves , which is a little bit different than that in the great picture of ourselves , i want to show you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , like i mean .
my wife told me .
she came from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told her about a student .
a computer student .
it likes to be particularly like it &apos;s a tendency to have a tendency to the too .
and she asked him what are you ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire fire .
and because i &apos;m at the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in the ted system .
yeah , you feel it , if you &apos;re screaming in this place . there &apos;s something wrong .
i said i said , always if a human being in a moral , the most powerful thing , we should try to replace it through the most important though .
do it once and then you experience the sentence .
although i &apos;m at the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in the ted system .
they feel that &apos;s the real truth behind the counter .
so a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a time .
the interested in the process of the world .
but there &apos;s no clubs that we can see , where you learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second second , just the fire fire .
there he was signed up .
and the most powerful , you &apos;re not saying your teacher , you &apos;d like to put fire somewhere , and you &apos;re happy when the fire is going to be a minute .
no , it just looks much better when we show that we &apos;re in charge of that , the dangers of the other , the other , if you &apos;re going to be fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this is the most powerful thing that the in the heart of the brain knew that he was actually related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t tell that .
here you have this kind of thing between the unconscious and the conscious , which is immediately carrying , without that you can do something about it , and the things you know is that you &apos;re going to look at it very much , so designed that you can look at a lot better for you , so designed that you can look at a lot better for you and others .
so , just then these words are going to be able to use the most beautiful thing that we &apos;re doing in the language of political correct .
we actually know that something else is .
but we know if we &apos;re saying that , the social analysis is very sensitive to the social .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to be able to be able to be able to present things that work .
so i want to argue what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
after what logic , these self-deception , the willingness to make a different reality as the ones we actually know in the unconscious , they &apos;re going to spread out , to spread outside .
so , i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is ahead of what many of you know and some of you appreciate , very few of you don &apos;t need to have a few .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is something intellectual , says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not from stop , physical nature .
and if you have people who are the solid belief that they have a soul , or you can say , you know , that you have been able to live from the soul to life , then the soul is so much , and the soul , the soul , is so much , as if the soul is so much of a mental framework about it , not the soul .
and from that soul , you think that you kind of in this , and you &apos;re kind of in this , in this particular nature , in this particular nature , it &apos;s called the latin , the present , present .
and when this is the most important thing about the people , it &apos;s filled with the people , and he &apos;s filled with mind , with nature , which can only live with soul .
and then he can just be a little bit of a time .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so she &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we should be able to perceive them as something that &apos;s really present for our lives .
and if you have this premise , you understand the logic that we experience this happiness , through a lie of our world .
because now you can apply a more powerful one .
you know , you know , you know , from school .
this is a very a more powerful one that describes us an logic .
this is the hardest part of the hardest part of my talk .
here you need something logic , but also the willingness to lie .
because that &apos;s how to lie that they can just apply this logic wrong .
in this particular , three sentences come from .
the first sentence is , the first sentence is , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if the right thing has right , he doesn &apos;t have soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i &apos;ve been in a particularly noisy one .
a third sentence , who immediately comes to people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
and they say who doesn &apos;t have soul , which is dead and can &apos;t say anything .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s the logic in this , yes , in this particular talk , in this particular talk .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences that are logical .
and i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a talk about reality .
i can say , the most powerful is a man .
and if i have right , the most powerful one is a man .
if i don &apos;t have right , the most powerful thing is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but critical is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s just .
so if the way you say , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have soul .
these things are logical .
and now our own consciousness feels immediately , you can do something .
it &apos;s a third sentence that doesn &apos;t have to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s what the opposite is , and it &apos;s going to be the opposite of the first sentence , and it &apos;s a result .
because actually , we have to prove whether there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that just uses that two sentences are accurate , and a third of the world , and a third of the time , that looks like it would have something to do with that , so we can save our own .
so , we &apos;re doing that as if it &apos;s actually impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things to different examples .
in the present , we have a very modern example of the world &apos;s most modern .
and you have to think about another philosophical topic , a more popular topic of philosophy , present .
that &apos;s what we do to do that we go back into the world &apos;s office .
there was a scholars who was named a woman who was named a woman &apos;s day , and after that , the most profound one was named .
the most profound one is a very profound , which is from pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
this is a kind of a kind of a computer .
and if you place the exact in the middle between two of the things between two .
because he doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be a haystack .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
so the most important thing is , the most important thing .
and the forces with the world &apos;s forces are solving each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
just if you get another example , so if you &apos;re going to make a snapshot bigger , it doesn &apos;t need reason to do it , and nothing else .
automatically , he &apos;s going to be the right thought .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in nature , you will be able to get out of the larger pile , which is a immediately , you know , you have a little bit of the feeling that it has to be like a free will .
and if we &apos;re in the world &apos;s office , i remember the most important thing for brain science .
there &apos;s a scholars that &apos;s called wolf , and it &apos;s telling you sometimes , wolf , and sometimes you say , wolf , there &apos;s no free .
now we can make the second sentence , and we can say , if wolf has right , he doesn &apos;t have free .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can now read in the newspaper day in the newspaper , which is what you find in this third sentence .
and that looks like that , who doesn &apos;t have free , can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to get to the action and claims , and it &apos;s so much .
and there are also it again .
and you have to prove , you know , you have to prove something like that .
but the logic of deception allows us to do that as if the first sentence was wrong , when you have to take the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just do if you want to do anything , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to do anything , you want to practice that courage to practice that courage to practice .
so , you know , for example , if you &apos;re going to meet a human being , you can &apos;t say there &apos;s no more sophisticated .
and please use the german word for the most german word , which means prophet .
it can &apos;t call them a little bit of political , and it &apos;s a little politically a bit of political .
say , there &apos;s no more sophisticated .
immediately they &apos;re going to be a , for that , of course , to be able to experience that , you can &apos;t prove that .
and already you have a problem .
because as you &apos;re busy , you &apos;re not able to prove that you can &apos;t prove that there is no more happy , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s fooled them .
because he &apos;s led to a red box , on the one he didn &apos;t even get .
because actually , this person doesn &apos;t care about evidence .
it &apos;s just interested in that , and it &apos;s going to be a way of having to prove that there &apos;s a lot of time .
so , in the way of the evidence of the evidence , you &apos;re going to experience the pioneers of the lie .
and if you have a way of feeling this , you know , to feel that , you know , to make it , because they &apos;re going to do other happy , if they &apos;re not going to remember their own .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve been allowed to have a lot of time , if i can mention it .
it &apos;s one of the most amazing , and it &apos;s asked me if i &apos;m going to hold a talk here and my idea .
i have to say , you have it , you &apos;ve got it to talk to me , and i was going to talk to you about my idea .
and i may be able to imagine my favorite , that i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
but it &apos;s of course , the sum of the sum , very many ideas .
i &apos;m probably a little bit of the two nice girls there , i &apos;m probably a little bit of the generation that has been made for this bad , which is a bad picture of this , because i &apos;ve started studying engineering in the world , and i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think , i think ,
and i was going to be in the &apos; 80s , and i was going to be the berlin of the 80s , because i wanted to do renewable energy and there was no one in the world .
there was the most popular thing .
the most popular thing that all the time , the most popular thing was , the most popular thing was called the most powerful .
the hot today today .
because a good engineer has built either great cars or a lot of the time .
but this is what the n is like , from the n , from kind of a hundred watts from the square meter , that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy thing .
i &apos;m grateful to be grateful that he &apos;s got the word again , because after the most important , you didn &apos;t use the word , because everything was bad , because everything was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that in the world &apos;s years .
there was this , there was a lot of time that there was a lot of time , and one of them was sitting in the most violent , where you did evil .
and the place of the world &apos;s population , but that was called the wind and it made wind and energy and i started in the &apos; 80s .
and yes , a lot of what was told today , i &apos;m very , very , very , very , many beautiful expressions that i &apos;ve lived in .
i worked in the collective years , which was a lot of time .
we were 20 people .
if one of the no said , the most powerful thing was , that &apos;s a completely powerful thing , i have a lot of time for this , and i &apos;ve been hard for a lot of time to do that , if i could really have my great thing to do with a little bit of the time , you have the money to the window .
it &apos;s busy .
and that was really very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , really , really , really , the great thing that &apos;s going to be the great thing .
and i &apos;ve got it to the most powerful and then we have a lot of time with friends , i &apos;ve become a little bit of a company that was then with the most popular of the world &apos;s largest world &apos;s largest world &apos;s largest world &apos;s largest world .
and a more , , , , of course , we have the problem of a growing company , and we have a little bit of a growing company , and then we have a little group , decided that we start little and back and we think about the next topic of the future and that &apos;s what i think is going to be , and that &apos;s what i think is the same topic , and that &apos;s what i think is going to be , and that &apos;s what i think is the same thing that &apos;s
and i brought you a project that i want to introduce you to now .
and the title of the talk was yes , like you get too 100 percent renewable .
and we just started to ask a relatively powerful story , where you could have a memory today .
on this island , that &apos;s the island of the island of the world &apos;s island .
yes , these are the data .
there are four thousand people living .
and that &apos;s a renewables today of 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
it &apos;s just technological .
if you get more wind each other , the system starts to fail .
i &apos;m also telling the politicians if they &apos;re in the world &apos;s plant , and they &apos;re going to be in the world .
and then , they always say why ?
we &apos;ve already got 20 percent in germany .
but it can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have seven percent , and our net is physically seen the european .
if we had 20 percent , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was just , the first thing that was , have been the first contacts with the island , but just to be able to calculate .
as big as it was actually a battery , it &apos;s like a battery that you &apos;re so doing , 30 , 40 , 50 , 50 , 50 , maybe 70 percent renewable .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go back a slide .
the conventional system looks like this in the world .
by the way , a year of a hundred percent of the electrical performance is covered on the world .
that &apos;s the performance of a hundred nuclear power because it &apos;s particularly fast everywhere .
the world &apos;s most important one , which is happening , is going to be thrown up with the north of the world because you don &apos;t need permission .
this is fast .
you &apos;re going to put it on the box .
and then it looks like this .
in the run , three of the most important ones are going to be waiting for two .
yeah , this is the same thing down there .
we also have a very precise data .
and the most powerful or the solar system or whatever it is , is a system of the rule of a system , which is just in small quantities here .
our goal was to say , okay , okay .
the bottom of the sea is going to be the wind and the wind , the sun , the burden that you can map the bigger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the performance in the moment , you have to turn the north pole off .
that means that the moment you have to worry about that is the renewables that can take the whole net .
you can only get it , of course , if you &apos;re going to be managed to be there in any way .
that &apos;s what nobody has done on the world .
there &apos;s this in the small style , so you can also use your car &apos;s car on a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
people always ask me what &apos;s going on in the world , because in the way that you &apos;re actually in the world ?
it &apos;s already .
but if you want to get several of these kinds of things , and you should build a net , then it will be extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to get to 70 to 90 percent renewable , and then there &apos;s this rest of the rest that last 10 , 20 percent renewable , 20 percent renewable , which will be very , very expensive and that will not work that you will do that .
that &apos;s going to be a fuel system that then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , it &apos;s going to be , and it &apos;s going to be .
they have to go more to a more sophisticated and not just a lot of the time , and they &apos;re not just going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s a normal , a regular battery , and we wanted to be a car .
how far do you get there ?
and then a lot of simulations did .
and have wind and sun and the burden and the burden , and they came to the outcome , a very exciting result that you have a middle of the conventional system that takes a middle of the conventional system to 20 cents a single one of the time .
these were the first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay , okay , okay .
it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we are cheaper like the most efficient , when the most powerful five percent per year goes up .
and then we started to negotiate with the most powerful .
what would all be done ?
have investors negotiate with investors , i &apos;ve looked at new design systems .
we were just five people at the time , and we were going to build a society again .
and again , the representation .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green system is our system .
that our system also has a more powerful , is that we &apos;re still doing 20 percent with the north of the other things , and also a more powerful thing to do with the other things .
and the most important thing that the most powerful thing that the most powerful thing is , has meant that we &apos;re going to find it very great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , which we kind of like the electric state of the island in the scale of a scale .
that means we &apos;re looking at the largest battery of the world .
here she is .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on from asia , where the case of japan .
and the officer is in the &apos; 70s , and the bbc &apos;s officer , and then , we &apos;ve been developed , and then it became a japanese thing to be the japanese .
it &apos;s you can see it , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
she has a megawatts of performance and can bring six hours for this performance and that &apos;s the battery that we have sort of a little bit of a little bit of a time .
and then they set up .
we also have one of these most powerful in the same size , like he &apos;s there , in the hall , to actually put the full dynamic behavior of this web , so in the hall , it &apos;s the big battery , and the sea is the big battery that we &apos;re going to simulate the web .
and over here we simulate the whole thing that &apos;s the whole thing that the cable of the cable , to represent the internet &apos;s web .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we can also get a hundred times more of the time to get the net .
here we see this again , we see the north pole again , again , the whole one , the whole one .
and what we did since the world &apos;s hall was finished , until today , until today , the most important thing is , what &apos;s going on between the individual system , and we did it .
so we &apos;re not a more sophisticated , but we define as a company that is only between the subject of battery and the subject of web and everything between .
you have to communicate with the battery , you have to communicate in the net , and it &apos;s very complicated to communicate .
the beauty is that you &apos;re basically in this island , basically , all the time that we can get in the world , which we &apos;re going to get when we want to increase our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion , as it &apos;s going to go back and get back , and the most powerful , like that , is to have the island , for example , we have to be for a for example , for example , for the wind , and the sun is going to be the sun .
then , the way it provides the way that we &apos;re going to be .
so , a more powerful thing .
we can start to integrate on the island , to integrate the , and we can do it , because it can manage the burden .
that means if you &apos;re in 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do it without memory .
you can get through the n , you can go through the nets , yes , you should do that in every case , the percentage of the , but you can never get rid of memory .
and this is the &quot; n &quot; .
so , many people come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn down the north pole , you don &apos;t have this kind of a mess , which causes a certain inertia in the net .
and our main system is basically taken out of louder , and we &apos;re basically from louder , which is always the wave everywhere , where the wave is all around europe .
we look in this web , see 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s going to be nine hertz , we start a few more powerful , and then we &apos;re going to get a few of the things that we &apos;re going to get back to , and then we get up .
this is the system .
and of course , this is incredibly challenging .
if you get that somewhere somewhere , it takes it for a while .
the most violent reserve has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in time , they can react to other things .
if you don &apos;t have that , these spinning mass , you have to replace this with a little bit of the time and you &apos;re replace it .
and we can even get a little battery in the big battery .
and then you see what enormous the enormous thing there is .
and the message is , we have to give up to this rotating masses when we kind of our goals , 20 percent , 20 percent , 20 , 30 , 30 percent and so on , if we want to do that at all , if we want to do that at all , if we want to do that at all , if we want to do that at all , if we want to do that at all , if we want to do that at all , if we want to do that at all ,
then we have to break our capacity into the net .
and it &apos;s just called the power power , and it &apos;s going to be the power power to keep the frequency .
yes , this is a very a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
and we &apos;re just trying to get to the capacity that you can make the capacity , the capacity , the capacity , to get down to the net , and it &apos;s going to bring the memory to the net .
now , there &apos;s a lot of studies now .
and that purpose is going to come and look at our own , and look at our own , sort of our own .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far you can get a piece of the future .
and many discussions i had in the last six years , were similar to the discussion i had in the last 30 years .
isn &apos;t it , is a more subtle , we have all of them , we never have anything .
we &apos;ve been in the today today , and we &apos;ve been in germany today .
this is a little bit of a time .
and i just go out of that , that we &apos;re going to store the same capacity in the next 30 years .
just , it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s a whole lot of the amount of plastic , and arguments .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve been able to have a lot of time in the last two years that scientists are asking to my side .
we have now to get over 10 million of the things that we have now to get to the german web .
this is going to be in april .
so , you know , there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s just about this recycling , and it &apos;s just about the idea of the idea , a hundred percent renewable .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a system of a system .
and it &apos;s always trying to do that in discussions , these are the most important , which is going to make a little bit of a little net that has nothing to do with our own .
the question is , but it &apos;s just if you &apos;re completely independent from some fossil or a half of fossil , which will be in the world , and you &apos;re going to be able to get a island .
then they just use what &apos;s going on in the sun and wind there , where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a computer supply , and i &apos;m also grateful to be grateful to use solar power .
and that &apos;s what we do , and we &apos;re going to come to the talk , and the talk of the day of the day , that you can be a collective , and use solar power , a little bit together .
and yeah , i want to just encourage you to encourage you to be a little bit crazy , and you can have a vision .
and you really have to stay quite hard to stay in it , but i think it &apos;s going .
thank you .
when steve hodgman , the los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , rough , rough , homeless , homeless , who played only two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from the paper of the article , it was a book that was going to be a book again , with robert , junior , as a beard , and jamie was going to be a beard , which was the most promising career , and the very promising career was released by his own schizophrenia .
nathaniel left , and i lived a breakdown and 30 years later , he lived as a homeless on the streets of los angeles .
i recommend all of you to read , and look at the film , and look at the film so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness between those two men , but also how the music helped this connection , and how it was allowed to make the instrument , and how it was allowed to make the instrument , and then it was the instrument , and then it was the instrument , and then it was the instrument , and then it was the instrument , and it was the instrument , and it was the
i met mr. &apos;s last year in 2008 , two years ago , in the phi disney hall .
he just heard a presentation of beethoven first and fourth symphony and came behind the stage to imagine .
he talked to a very much more powerful and a little bit of a computer , and hillary clinton and hillary clinton and about how the dodgers never would do it in the baseball world . and that all because of the world &apos;s passage of beethoven &apos;s fourth sentence .
we came to talk to music , and a few days later , i got an email , in the state that nathaniel was interested in me .
i have to mention that nathaniel was a medical treatment , because he was already with electric and with a lot of time and the fiber of the world , a trauma that has been tracking him .
as a result , it &apos;s particularly prone to these schizophrenic stages , and these are sometimes bad , and he disappears in the streets of the streets , and he &apos;s going to go out of the streets of the street , always that horror and the most powerful of his own mind .
and in exactly a way , nathaniel was when we started with our first class in the phi disney hall , and he had this kind of thing in his eyes , and he was completely lost .
he talked about invisible outliers and smoke and the smoke of how someone wanted to go to sleep .
i was afraid , not a lot of time , but i was afraid that i could lose him , that he could sink in a state of his states and i could destroy his relationship to the violin when i started to talk about scale and other exciting forms of the world &apos;s own .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s first sentence .
and while i played , i fell on , in the eyes of a complete change .
it was when he was under the impact of a invisible drug , a chemical response , whose own one was my game .
and the anger is turned to understanding the anger in understanding , in a calm curiosity and grace .
and as a miracle , he took his violin and started playing some clips of the computer , and then i asked them to play , to play , to play , to play , the most powerful , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the , the .
we started talking about music , starting from bach , and the bach , the , and all the other people , and all the other people who are the other , from the other to the other , to get the other of the other .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just know a computer of music , but it also was a tight personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i just know about my colleagues in the nanoscale of los angeles .
by playing music , and talked about music , it was from this kind of thing , confused man , who was just moved through the streets of los angeles , a computer , a great , great , great , in straightforward trained musicians .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means emotional health .
because the music allows him to be his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in something real .
and so he &apos;s going to be his own conditions .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
this is why we do music : so we &apos;re doing something that &apos;s in all of us , deep in the inner , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity .
and the reality of this expression is all going to get us , and it moves and we &apos;re moving .
what nathaniel was called the music back to a community of friends .
the power of music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood his talent , and he realized the motor .
and i &apos;m going to always be with nathaniel , whether in the rowe disney hall or in the world , because he reminds me why i &apos;ve become musicians .
thank you .
bruno &apos;s : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i &apos;ve stolen the most powerful .
i hope you forgive me .
so i &apos;ve known many fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first one that was more like a passionate thing .
it was a beautiful fish , a good , good , good , good , a book on the slide .
what a fish .
even better , he was grown in the most popular standards of sustainability .
so you could feel that it &apos;s going to be to sell him .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
one day , the boss called the company , and asked if i could tell you about a event of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company that was trying to solve what this unimaginable problem has become for our chefs . how do we keep fish on our own ?
in the last 50 years , we have the oceans in the world , as we have beaten forests .
it &apos;s hard to be the destruction of the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the most popular , the most powerful , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , maybe or bad , or bad , a part of our future .
many arguments about it . the environment is the environment , most of you , and you &apos;re inefficient , you take tuna , take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a more powerful of 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of the way that we have needed to get a pound of a pound .
not very sustainable .
don &apos;t taste very well .
so finally , a company was trying to do it right .
i wanted to encourage them .
the day before the event , i called the boss of the compiler for the company .
let &apos;s take it .
&quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts , you &apos;re famous for that , so far outside the sea , that you don &apos;t get rid of the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out , that the waste of our fish is distributed , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this is a &quot; he said to one &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
and to one , great .
&quot; pay to one thing ? what do you feed ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put .
and at that night , i was in bed and thought , what is the hell of hell ?
so i called the next day , shortly before the event , don &apos;t take .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you know what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to be able to do it .
well , i &apos;m going to be a few people in the company . nobody could give me a decent answer to a decent answer to the senior biologists .
let &apos;s also take it .
&quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; what are the sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some of the things that he said , and then he said , &quot; he said , &quot; well , he said , &quot; well , he said .
i said , &quot; well , &quot; the &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , &quot; the skin , &quot; bite , dry and to eat . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of the food system is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , these are about 30 percent &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you know what &apos;s sustainable to feed chicken on fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i &apos;m going to be from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a computer company and a computer company .
this is actually me .
no , i actually have a lot of the fish of this fish because , i swear to god who was being held after the fish after this conversation .
this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love .
it &apos;s the romantic way that you know , the better you learn to know your fish , you know the fish .
i &apos;ve been eating him first in a restaurant in a restaurant .
a journalist was talking for a long time of this fish .
it &apos;s sort of a way of doing it .
he came up with a light , almost a little bit of white color .
the chef had him .
wait twice .
amazingly , he still was delicious .
who can make a fish so good after he became a lot of time ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a it .
and no , he didn &apos;t have the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least the way they understand and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at the end of la la .
this is a kind of a computer in the middle corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s was the farm in the hands of the hands .
they were working on what was basically wetlands .
they made this by making the country .
they built these complicated consequence of channels , and they were going to be out of the land , and they &apos;re out in the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that that worked , not economically .
and green was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds to be a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company bought a spanish company with green .
what did you do ?
they have the flow of the water .
they literally have thrown the lever .
instead of using the water , they used the channels to get the water back .
they &apos;re going to be the channels .
they created a 11,000 acres of a little bit of a little bit -- the , shrimp , shrimp , shrimp -- and they have a lot of the environmental destruction , and the environmental destruction , the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like this .
they stare at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything they &apos;re seeing are the channels of the channels and these density , lush march .
i didn &apos;t have a long time ago with a little bit of a time .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and part of a crocodile to kiss .
okay ? there we were and fought through the wetlands and i &apos;m going to have a little bit of the wetlands and i have a little bit of a time , and i &apos;m holding a little bit of a time to my knees , and the blink of the quiet is a very , very quiet one .
here he picks up a rare , rare .
now he mentioned the most popular of the approval .
and here he looks at a pattern of concentrate that reminds him the most powerful giraffe .
it turns out that that &apos;s the largest part of its career in the national park in africa .
i asked him how to have a computer company .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and falls into more talk of rare birds and algae and weird .
and you don &apos;t understand me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the community community , so in the way that the way in the way that the way in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love with it .
and my head was weak about this kind of thing that i had on the most powerful piece of delicious .
so i &apos;ve interrupted it . i said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know young , the algae , the humanities , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what are your fish eating ?
how is the most important thing ? &quot;
now , he goes to tell me that it &apos;s a rich system that the fish are eating , which they would eat in the wild .
the divorce of the statements , the approval , the mountain , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely a lot of time .
there &apos;s no food .
the one farm , the one of the people who don &apos;t feed their animals ?
and then , later , i went around with the site with a convincing , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be like that , &quot; unlike any farm i &apos;ve ever been , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
in the moment , it was when a director had a director of a child .
and we &apos;re checking the corner and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pinker , a literally pinker carpet , and a literally pinker carpet .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your own , pink .
they &apos;re going to be . &quot;
and i was totally confused . i was completely confused .
i said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and the birds .
now last year , in this site , 600,000 birds were more than 250 different types of species .
it &apos;s the largest and one of the most important private species of the most important private system in europe .
i said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he woke his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building the most powerful , not intense .
this is a environmental network .
the most important food is eating shrimp .
the shrimp eat the approval .
so the pinker the belly the better system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals and a farm that &apos;s measuring their success in health .
a more powerful , but also a more powerful .
oh , by the way , and by the way , this is not even there .
they breed in a city of 240 miles away where the most important thing is better for the most important .
every morning they fly 240 miles to farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles .
they do that because they can follow the white white line of the highway .
seriously .
i had introduced a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at a little bit of a journey .
i said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me when i was quoted a song of whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , the delicious , and i don &apos;t like a computer designer , and i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this kind of thing that &apos;s the way that it &apos;s the , the taste of taste .
i &apos;m almost never cooking with it .
and yet , when i tried to have it in this restaurant in the restaurant , she didn &apos;t have to be held in the restaurant .
she liked sweet and in , when you would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned this to the metabolic and he &apos;s going to be a little bit of a time .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense before something in the body .
she has evolved in the course of evolution to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
and then he added it , &quot; but our water has no more a more powerful . &quot;
okay . one farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish . a farm that measures their success is success of their predators .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a computer , he &apos;s got enormous , because the water , that &apos;s going to flow through this farm from the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things to the rivers today , and they tend to lead to chemical pollutants , flow of the water .
and when it fought through the system , and this leaves is clean , as it &apos;s a lot of time .
the system is so healthy , it collapses the water .
so not only one farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that &apos;s measuring their success in health , but a farm that literally is a more powerful , and not just for them and me .
because if the water is going to be the water , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that should do it , because this love love , as romantic , is also also more , also , also , also , is also an alarming .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good food , whether we talk about the world &apos;s or a half .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food of the food .
but for many people , this is a little bit too radical .
we &apos;re not a more sophisticated , we &apos;re going to be a lover . we &apos;re lover .
we love farmers . we love little more sophisticated . we &apos;re talking about local food . we eat organic .
and if you say that the things are the future that &apos;s going to be a good food , somebody else is on and says , &quot; hey people , i love the world &apos;s world , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;re going to produce enough calories to feed the world more than only feed .
a billion people are going to be starving today .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of the way that we &apos;re in the distribution of the distribution , not the gas gas .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because they &apos;re the logic of our own 50 years of the last 50 years .
feed grain , the brain of the brain , the chemicals on the earth , chemicals on earth , chicken , and the whole time has just asked the agribusiness , &quot; if we feed more people , how awful can that be cheaper ? &quot;
this was the cause . it was the most powerful thing . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what she is , a liar in a corporate , a facilitator that &apos;s fast to be able to do that , which is that production is going to be able to do that .
this is not a single single one , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our main system is threatened today , not because of the most powerful , but because of the resources , it &apos;s due to the resources .
not by the latest , and the latest , but by fertile land , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not by limited , but by the forests , and not through the forests , and by the forests , and by fish , it &apos;s not through the ocean .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that are allowed to feed each community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in it , and it never made a good thing to eat .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is that it &apos;s a little bit of a year of the year that &apos;s going to be more nuanced .
look at the absence of the , farmers like a convincing .
businesses that are not worlds for themselves , businesses that are communicating instead of the world , and they &apos;re growing up , and they &apos;re just doing a lot of farmers that are not just just just just just not just to be able to do it , but experts for relationships , they &apos;re not experts .
because they &apos;re the ones who are also experts for taste .
and if i really am honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;ll ever be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if the future is good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to illustrate a thing today , it &apos;s the total of the data that we consume , bigger than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking about it , and i think that they can think about how we can use information so that patterns are going to be so much .
so what we see here is a typical of the age of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called the most powerful and what i can do with a certain deal of death , we can filter accidents .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes it happen .
and that &apos;s because in the world &apos;s population , people are active and they &apos;re over here on the top of the world .
we can go out and line the data , and then you see the data and you see that the usual suspects are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , if we go on and after age , we &apos;re going to see 40 years or younger , we &apos;re even looking at accidents that are even concerned about the people who should worry about people .
and who &apos;s looking at that is that it &apos;s particularly true of men .
so you see that this is what the information is about , and the data in this way is very focused on swimming in a living world .
and if we can do this for data data why not for content itself ?
so what we &apos;ve now got here is the most important one of the things that have ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it to my talk in your rooms .
with the most powerful , you can get into a decade .
you can get into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this copy and the sport .
i &apos;m a very unlikely armstrong fan , so i click here , and i &apos;m going to click in this way to be a very precious armstrong .
now , if i want to get a very , very , very , very , very , really , really , what if i look at everything with the subject of the subject ? &quot;
so i go back to a step and the view of the view .
now i see greg &apos;s .
and so you get a idea of that if you &apos;re stuck on this kind of information , more efficient , more efficient , more democratic , you don &apos;t just look at it or not just just not just .
you make something that &apos;s actually a little different .
it &apos;s something between it , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to do this idea now with about what a little bit crazy is .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single one of the individual , and they reduce a little summary .
the summary contains a short set of view and a symbol of the area that you come from .
i just show the top 500 of the top of the top .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are on wikipedia on the top .
i &apos;m going to choose the subject of government .
now , after i chose government , i know that the most important thing that most of the time that most of the time is , &quot; people who are going to be a year of the year . &quot;
this is really important , because this is a realization that is not in a single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single
this is just to recognize if you go back and look at the whole thing .
so , let &apos;s go to a certain of these summaries , and then i &apos;m going to go to the subject of time , and all of the time , and all together .
so , if i look at all these people , i know that the majority of it are the majority of this . some of them come from science . some , less , come from the economy .
and interestingly , bono is a ted prize .
so we can jump and look at all ted prize , and look at the ted prize .
you see , we &apos;re going to melt the web as if it &apos;s really a net , not just to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what another surprise might be .
i just show you the new york times .
and the use of this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites -- and we can put these kinds of things in the single website like this .
so i can go back to a step , and right to a specific unit .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re just looking at the websites of the websites in this kind of websites , and the whole way to look at the same way .
so i can zoom in my course in a certain scale .
here &apos;s the whole demonstration that i &apos;ve been given to here .
and i can kind of , what i &apos;ve seen today , again , again .
and , if i look back a step , and i can look at everything , i can organize my course , maybe i could organize my course of my own , and here i have a look for the live of the , and here after live labs .
and from here , i can go to the side and go again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used again , and every time it makes it bigger than the sum of the world &apos;s sum .
in the moment , in this world , we think that data is a servant .
we talk about the terrace of the world &apos;s office .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head , so that we &apos;re always going to go from a to another , and we start to go from a lot of things to do , and that &apos;s what otherwise would be hidden ?
if we can do this , then this last time , maybe a new source of self is going to be more complex information .
and , instead of moving in information , we can know that .
and if we know , then we can even make wisdom from it .
so i hear , thank you very much .
i grew up with a little bit of science fiction fiction .
in my school , i went to school to school , every day a hour a track .
and my nose always put in a book , a computer , which was my thoughts in other worlds , and my deep way of my deep , and my deep curiosity , and i &apos;m going to be able to get out of the way that i &apos;m going to be able to get out of the , pragmatic curiosity .
this curiosity was also shown that i always was when i wasn &apos;t in school , through the forests , and &quot; samples , &quot; and &quot; samples , &quot; frogs and snakes and the beetle , and looked at everything , and under the microscope .
i was totally a very reactive , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and the limits of the possible explore .
and my love to science was in my environment , because in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon , and we were studying the deep sea .
jacques leakey came in our living room with his fascinating shows that animals and places were shown by miracles and a world that we &apos;ve never imagined before .
and then that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do , and it &apos;s very good to the most good .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there &apos;s no video games that have been the whole video video with the video of the brain , and i had to create the images in my head .
we had to all have to do that at all . if we read a book , we took the description of the author and the most amazing , and the dutch of the author in our heads .
my response to this was drawing and paint from aliens , aliens worlds , robots , and all of that .
in the math department , i was constantly caught from teachers , like i , in the textbook , hidden .
creativity had to be somehow out .
and something interesting happened . what i was fascinated with jacques is the thought of a completely unknown world here on our earth itself .
i would never have a alien world with a spaceship . that seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i could actually go to , here on earth , and she was just fascinating and exotic as all that i had always been introduced to , when i had read these books .
so i decided to become 15 , diver .
the only problem that i was in a small village was in canada , one of the next ocean from the next ocean .
i didn &apos;t have to be frustrated .
i &apos;m going to be my father , until finally , a little bit of a time in a cartoonist , new york , and i &apos;ve been able to discover exactly the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my favorite in a pool of the middle of the winter in a pool of the winter in a hurry , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got two years later to face when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , that &apos;s now a half , i spent about three hours under water . 500 hours of it in tunis .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the world &apos;s ocean , is so rich in the world &apos;s ocean , as we really can imagine .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know borders , in contrast to our own , the human imagination .
and i &apos;m going to feel the deepest awe for what i see on my nickname .
and my love to the ocean is holding on the same intensity as the same intensity and ever .
when i &apos;m going to be a profession , it was the way that i was a profession .
this seemed the best way to tell my inner , stories to tell stories , to create pictures , to unite images .
as a child , i drew books and so .
so films of the way , images and stories are bringing together . it &apos;s going to be together .
of course , the stories i &apos;m going to do was , from the most powerful , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; i could connect my preference for the water and the way that we &apos;re going to connect with the way .
so , basically , my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; to solve a problem in this movie -- and we had to create a kind of liquid . &quot;
what came out of that was the first cloned , the first one that was ever in a movie .
the film was not a money , just said , he just played his cost , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience on the world was like 1,600 from the magic , which was coming out of it .
according to arthur doyle &apos;s law , the law is not to distinguish technology and magic .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s going to be involved in the most important . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , still more .
together with the guy , we created the guy from liquid metal , and the success was very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , really .
and it worked . again , we had created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same thing , but we &apos;ve got a little bit more money .
from those two experiences , a whole new world was achieved , a whole new world of creativity for the most important .
so i started a company , together with my good friend , alex , who was at the best time , and it was the digital , and she was called digital the &quot; digital &quot; .
the idea of this company was , the phase of analog processes with visual printers , and to start with digital printers .
and then we did that , and we also have a advantage of a advantage .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the most violent and the most powerful -- what we &apos;ve actually founded -- too slow .
i had written this piece of avatar , which is the route in things that are in visual effects and the effects of the effects in the new heights , with a very powerful human , simulated characters , and the world should be made to be made . and the world should be all the time . and the world should be all the time . and the world should be all the time . and the world should be all the time . and the world should be all the time . and the world should be all
but the bar was very beautiful , and people in my company said that we &apos;re not able to do that in the situation that we &apos;re not able to do .
so i shifted this and made this other movie about the big ship , the shooting .
and i &apos;ve sold this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but i was actually going to be in the real train of the titanic .
so i did the film .
this is the truth . the studio knew that , but not .
but i &apos;ve convinced them by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to go to the train . we film the real train .
we &apos;re going to show it in the movie of the film .
this is immensely important . it &apos;s a good thing for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund a expedition .
sounds crazy . but this is again that the own imagination can create a reality .
we actually created six months later , which i &apos;m in a russian , in a russian , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i looked at the real titanic through a computer .
this was not a movie , no one , that was really .
so , that really has been made me .
and the level of the level was enormous . we had to build cameras and the lights and everything .
and i fell on how much these kinds of things , a more similar thing .
well , they were also more sophisticated and more sophisticated planning .
you go up in these capsule , then you turn down into this dark , hot environment , where no hope is in saving , if you don &apos;t make it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a computer .
this is really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , the part of the part of curiosity and science has been doing it , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that could not give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .
and in some of the next expeditions , i saw creatures in the world , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that nobody had seen before , and for the science , when we saw them , they didn &apos;t find words .
so that &apos;s really a really powerful thing , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met a little unusual decision .
after the titanic , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my favorite as a filmmaker in hollywood , and will be a while for a while . &quot;
and then we started to get the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; and they explored them with a lot of time .
we went back to the train of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which was a computer company .
our intention was to look at the inner and looking at the inner of the ship , which was never done before .
nobody had ever explored the inner of the world &apos;s inner . so , we didn &apos;t have a means for that . so we developed the technology .
and i &apos;m sitting there , and i &apos;m going to go on the titanic of the titanic , in a computer , and see , and see , that &apos;s pretty similar to this , and that &apos;s what i know that once the band was played there .
and i fly with a little bit of a little bit of the ship .
i &apos;m actually supporting it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically inside the titanic of the titanic .
that was the kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a computer system that i &apos;ve ever experienced . because before i put a corner in the world , i always knew what was going on in the vehicle , and i was going to be a film of the vehicle when i went to the film .
because the set was a very careful copy of the ship .
so that was a very strange experience .
she made me aware of this kind of thing that you use such a little bit of the time , and that &apos;s what your consciousness is in the vehicle , in these other form of existence .
it was really profound deeply profound .
and maybe a little view of what might happen in some decades , if you have a little bit of a time , to explore something or to do things , in all kinds of things that i can imagine as a computer .
and after that expeditions , we started that , which we &apos;ve seen down there , really appreciate , for example , that &apos;s what we saw , for example , that &apos;s what we saw incredibly amazing animals , but here on earth .
they live with help .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight in sunlight , as we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
and i also was interested in the same time , i also was very interested in the same time , which was the most popular thing from my childhood .
and so i ended up with people who are interested in space and to do with nasa and they &apos;re sitting in the world and they &apos;re going to be able to get right and plan to be able to go through russia , through the mission of the mission , and they &apos;re going to go through the international record , and they &apos;re going to go to the international record , and they &apos;re going to fly to the international record , and they &apos;re going to fly on the international record , and they &apos;re going to
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was out that i took a lot of time to get into the deep sea .
i took them to the world , and i &apos;m going to give you access to the world , and i &apos;m going to be there to the world , and i took them down to the world , and i took them to the size of the extreme situations , and so they could test them , and they could test the tools , and they could test the tools and test instruments and so forth .
we were doing it , but actually science , but actually science , more specifically , said , &quot; well , more powerful .
so the circle of my existence is as a child , and the way a child , and the way that the reality is in reality .
in the course of this pipeline , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you &apos;re certainly thinking , a director of a leader , a leader , like a computer or something like that .
but i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i &apos;m going to get this expeditions .
because in a particular point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s coming out ? &quot;
this is a little bit of a little bit of a money , not a money .
we &apos;re playing the cost of the cost of the cost .
all of you think i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and i would have the nails on a towel on a towel on the beach .
i &apos;ve all got these films , these are made for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it about the task will be the challenge , and the ocean is the most powerful environment , which is there . you &apos;re doing it because of the strange connection , and because of the strange connection , that &apos;s when a little group of people are making a team .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who worked for years , sometimes we were two to three months in the sea .
and in this community , you see that the most important thing is that the most important thing that you have , because you have a task that you can &apos;t explain to any other one .
if you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the pop , the most powerful , and that &apos;s all the way that the whole technology , and the trouble , the human performance , if you work on sea , you can &apos;t explain that .
there &apos;s a connection , a measure of respect .
so when i came back to turn my next film , &quot; avatar , i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you &apos;re being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
so , this was really changed the dynamics .
so , i was again with a little team on a mild terrain , and we were called &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that there was no longer .
incredibly exciting .
a tremendous challenge .
and we were in a period of four years to a right family .
so , my way to do my way , to make movies completely .
there were people who said we would have been doing this kind of thing , and we &apos;ve been going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
for me , it was more a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a way to do my job , the real process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we close from all of this ?
what lessons are we learned ?
i think the first thing is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the claim of your team is more important than all of the world &apos;s world &apos;s world .
to me young filmmakers , who say , &quot; give me a advice like i can do something like that . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t even say a &quot; you don &apos;t even do a .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to get for you . don &apos;t do it , don &apos;t bet yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has a kind of a more powerful one : &quot; fail is not an alternative . &quot;
but in the art and the study , it needs to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a more powerful thing .
no important endeavor , the innovation , was ever held without risk .
you have to be ready to take risks to yourself .
this is the thought i &apos;d like to give you with the way . fail is a alternative , but it &apos;s not a alternative , but thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and that may be a little bit like that , because my favorite thing is mostly about vaccines and seeds to be the things that we have to invent and deliver to make the poorest two billion billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , just more important than every other thing on the planet .
and the most important thing is that their own cell cell is not going to grow over many years , and we &apos;re going to get too much , and we &apos;re going to get to a lot of rain . the things are going to be able to do as it can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
it leads to the way that it leads to uncertainty . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , a climate change will be terrible for you .
and also , the most important thing for you is very important .
the fact is , if you could reduce the price of a thing , the energy would be energy at far most effective .
now , the most important thing is , the time is about time .
in fact , the most powerful thing is based on the most powerful .
the most popular revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rising case in the 20th century , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerators , and we can make a lot of things , and so many things do .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s take the price out -- we &apos;re going to make a new barrier and this barrier of co2 .
co2 is the planet , and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they &apos;re going to be able to be able to get the carbon dioxide , which leads to the most powerful and this kind of thing that has a very negative implications . effects on the weather and maybe worse , the accuracy of the natural ecosystems that are not able to adapt to the natural ecosystems and so all systems .
now , the exact relationship between a computer and the web is the web and where their other consequences are , there are some of these things , but not very many .
and there are certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to be . but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i asked the most powerful few times , &quot; we really have to go down to the slow zero ?
don &apos;t it enough or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close zero , the temperature will go down .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a 3.5 feet high truck , which has to come under a three feet of bridge .
this has to go down to zero .
now , we &apos;re going to get a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a time , over 26 billion tons .
every americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons of every one on the planet .
and somehow we need to create changes that are lower on zero .
it &apos;s a lot of constant .
just different economic changes , and we have to have to increase from the rise of reducing the rise of reducing and to reduce a reduction to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of a little bit of a sudden . they have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to bring zero and that &apos;s going to be dependent on the number of people , which are the average energy of the service that everybody &apos;s using in average , the average energy for every service , which is the average energy for every service , which is the average energy for every service , which is the average energy for every service , which is the average energy
so let &apos;s look at each factor of the factor and we think about how we get that on zero .
probably one of these numbers has to come very close to zero .
now that &apos;s fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first of all , we have the population .
today , more billion people live .
and it &apos;s going to move on nine billion of the world &apos;s billion billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the most powerful and the most powerful , we might be able to reduce that for 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see an slope about 1.3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
it includes all the food that we eat , clothing , tv , heat .
these are very good things and the most good things that means to make these services almost every one on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could probably make a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , and less use , but in average , this number is going to go to each year and so on , and so far than double the number of services .
so here we see a very fundamental service . there &apos;s a very fundamental service , so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their own , and they &apos;re going to read their own .
now , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
because of different successes in the world &apos;s office , through other ways , through new methods , there are many services , there are many services that are going to make some individual services to 90 percent .
in other services , like manufacturing , the manufacturing of the world , 00 : &apos; 80s : the -- &amp; &#93; -- &amp; : southeast : the u.s.
and in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , maybe we might get a reduction to a factor of three or maybe a factor about six .
but at the first three factors , we &apos;re now in 26 billion tons of tons of tons , and that &apos;s not enough .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that will be a unit of a unit of a unit .
it turns out , if you can get that on zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
almost every single one of the electricity of electricity today is co2 , except renewables , and the renewables .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need to be more powerful .
now , if i use the term &quot; wonders , i don &apos;t use the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and the services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these wonders .
normally there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to a certain date .
usually you &apos;re just going to be wrong and some come , other people .
but in this case , we have to give up and get a miracle in very short time .
now , i asked myself how can i really get that ?
is there a natural debut , a demonstration that the idea of people here are going to go ?
i remembered last year when i got mosquitos and somehow liked people .
the idea was really tangible for you , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , this is a .
i decided that this was going to be made of fireflies to the environment here .
so here &apos;s a few natural fireflies .
you told me that they don &apos;t bite . actually they &apos;re not going to leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of things like this , but they all don &apos;t get much .
we need solutions , either one or several that have a unimaginable scaling and unimaginable government , and even though there are many directions that people are looking for , i really see five , i really see five , which can afford these big demands .
i &apos;ve left the tides , and i left the tides , fusion and biofuels .
and that might be a very promising contribution , and if you &apos;re better , i would expect to be great , but my punch line here is that we have to work on all these five , and we can &apos;t give them out of them because they &apos;re concerned about it , because all of us have been concerned about it , because all of us have been concerned about it because all of us have been concerned .
let &apos;s first take the burning fossil fuels , burning from either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there is maybe , but it &apos;s not . you have to do all this co2 , which is going to go from the burning , and then you &apos;re going to capture it , and you hope it &apos;s going to be there .
there are some of the things that are going to be on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get very difficult to get a very difficult thing , and a 401 problem is the most important problem .
who will make sure ?
who can guarantee something that &apos;s literally a lot more than any of the waste that you can imagine from the waste of the waste and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a tough case .
next : the next thing .
and that also has three big problems . the cost of the cost of the world is high in the world , and the question is to be a lot of the time that you can really feel wrong , despite the human collaboration , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the garbage ?
because though he &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that may be soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work .
the last three of the five years i &apos;ve been in .
it &apos;s renewables , as you &apos;re often called .
and also , even though it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
one is the energy density that creates these technologies dramatically less than power power .
these are the most powerful , you talk about many of the things that are a thousand more , thousand more surface than a normal power station .
also , this sources of information is going to be .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem to seem all day , it doesn &apos;t seem every day and the wind also doesn &apos;t get the wind all day .
so you have to be dependent on these sources , a way of having a way to get energy in times when you &apos;re not available to get it .
so there are big amounts of energy , and there are challenges in the transmission , and if we say that the energy source is outside the country , they don &apos;t need the technology , they need to be able to deal with the risk of where the energy comes from where the energy comes from where the energy comes from where the energy comes from where the energy comes from where the energy comes from where the energy comes from where the energy comes from where the energy comes from where the energy comes from where the energy
and there &apos;s the most powerful thing .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve all got the kinds of batteries that are made , looking at the cars , computers , computers , mobile phones , for everything . and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been doing with the amount of electronic energy , which is the world that &apos;s using the world , and i found that all the batteries that are using . i found that all the batteries that are using . i found that all the batteries that are using . i found that all the batteries that are using . i
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be a 100 better than the approaches to time .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
that &apos;s what happens when you try to get this kind of information , we &apos;re going to get 20 percent of the rest of the rest of the rest .
if you want to support 100 percent on it , you need an incredible kind of a incredible thing .
now , where should we go : what is the right approach ?
&quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need is many companies that work on it . hundreds .
in each of these five areas we need at least 100 people .
and you &apos;re going to say , you &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s good .
i think there are a lot of the ted group in the ted group there .
bill big companies have several companies , under other people called the great most great , great .
and the most amazing thing is , in dozens of companies , the great things are doing the great things and i have to support that .
nathan myhrvold and i finance a company that , maybe surprisingly , the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the world &apos;s most important ; the liquid , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry some time , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are lying .
the most important thing means that instead of a part of the world &apos;s population , that &apos;s a percent , the most powerful , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the most powerful .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about this long , but you could never simulate a reasonable , whether it would work , but there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and you see that , it &apos;s going to be done .
and because you burn these 99 percent , it &apos;s a lot better .
in fact , you &apos;re going to burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of today as a computer system .
instead of breaking the head , they just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium will be used to be a little bit like a candle .
you see that it &apos;s a kind of pillar , often as &quot; traveling wave reactor . &quot;
that really solve the most powerful .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste that 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called the way that it &apos;s called the uranium uranium .
the oecd the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re going to get cheap and just get a lot of fuel , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
how should our testimony look like ?
now , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to do and then we talk about the most important .
many of a 80 percent reduction of a 80 percent reduction .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something agriculture . hopefully , it will be a little bit of a time , and i &apos;ll be clean to it .
so , to reach these 80 percent , the developed countries have to grow countries like china , their own lives completely change .
the other note says , if we use the technology technology , whether they &apos;re used in all countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
this is great .
this is going to be an important thing that &apos;s going to be a key thing .
if we go back from there , how should 2020 look like this ?
it should be again the two elements .
we should use the most sophisticated to get reduction on the way , the less we &apos;re going to be the lower , the lower , and also the temperature .
but actually , this note is for things that we &apos;re doing , which is not completely to the big , just , or even less important as the other , or even less important as the other thing that &apos;s the speed of innovation for this breakthroughs .
and we have to track this breakthroughs with the way we can measure and measure that , in the world , in the world , in the world , in the world , in the world , and the most powerful .
there are many great books that are in this topic .
al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david &apos;s energy &quot; energy &quot; energy . &quot;
they really go through and create a frame where this can be discussed , because we need to support all the pages of all sides .
there &apos;s a lot of that needs to come together .
this is a wish .
a very specific wish that we invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i could choose that wish , or i could choose that wish , which is , the way that we &apos;re going to take it to the same thing , and i can choose that wish .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the dig is going to be terrible between the long and short people , and the other people , between the united states and china , between poor and rich , and almost all of these two billion of these two billion .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do ?
we need to use more research for more research .
if countries are going to meet in places like the way they &apos;re going to meet , they shouldn &apos;t only talk about co2 .
they should talk to these kinds of things , and they were shocked by the ridiculous low secondary practices that are spent for these innovative approaches .
we need to control co2 , co2 control , and trade &amp; amp ; trade is something that creates a computer system .
we need to spread the message .
we need to make dialogue and make a full thing , and also the things that are done by the government .
it &apos;s a very important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you !
thank you . just to understand something better -- you can do a sense of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , all the great scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we need some 10 million , and even if we &apos;ve tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it works reasonable , it &apos;s just a lot of the time .
the difficult step is building the first parking system , more billion , which is the most important and the place of actually building the first one .
once the first finished is , if it &apos;s going to be like that , it &apos;s all right , because the state of the energy is so different than the business rate , as we know it .
to understand that , that means building deep in the ground almost like a vertical column nuclear nuclear nuclear , that uses the process and then it starts to go down ?
and the same thing : right . today , you have to be new , so you have to be able to get a lot of people and many controls , and many controls that can go wrong , and that &apos;s not good .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can get it to 60 years of fuel -- think about a column -- you &apos;re buried , without all the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and burns 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
a more powerful one , the self is a solution to the trash .
and the fact is , yes . well , what happens to the garbage : you can sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it and put it on the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the garbage , which is already , which is already in these kinds of things or the reactors in the reactors . that &apos;s our main system .
so , what &apos;s a problem for these reactors , which was what we put in our and it &apos;s going to reduce the most dramatic , as this process .
but as you &apos;ve talked about different people in the world .
where is the biggest interest , so what really do ?
and we &apos;ve been doing it , we haven &apos;t been stuck on a place and there &apos;s a lot of interesting things for everything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there &apos;s big interest and the people in russia , india , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china , china
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is a vaccine of one thing that was done .
this is a more important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries built this , so everybody who has a quick reactor , a very quick one for our first .
in your imagination , space and probability of the way to call it a really life ?
and so , we need to have one of these most powerful things , and we need to make things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then use 20 years to use .
this is sort of the deadline that we &apos;ve been looking at the most powerful , which we have to follow .
and , you know , you know , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds , which , as if their approaches work , the value of their pilots , can be able to do it for their pilots .
and it would be best if it &apos;s going to make several , because then you could use a mixture .
in every case we need a solution .
so , the big kinds of breakthroughs , is this the largest thing you know ?
and the most important thing is , a computer model is the most important thing .
it would have been without the most important , but it &apos;s still so much more important .
in nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there &apos;s the explorers that is another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid , which seems to be something difficult , but maybe the that &apos;s about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the beautiful thing is that a million times a million times has a lot of energy like a , say , &quot; we &apos;re going to say a computer and therefore , if you can deal with the problems and that &apos;s mostly the radiation , the power and the cost , the power , the power , the power and the cost , is the potential , so the impact and the cost , the capacity , the power , the power and the cost , is the potential , so the
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
we have to get to the way to try to get the most stable stable ?
and the most important thing is , if you get into this situation , it &apos;s as if you eat too much , and you &apos;re a heart attack . what do you do ? you might need a match or similar .
there &apos;s a research research called the world &apos;s research , which is to be able to be able to engage with different techniques to get the warming to be able to get the warming to the warming , so we get 20 or 30 years to get us more .
this is just a kind of a computer .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t be working on insurance because one may be lazy , so you &apos;re going to eat that you &apos;re going to save the heart attack .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you &apos;re going to get the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in the field of whether you have to get that to be available , if things are going to come faster , or that innovation needs longer than we expect .
climate change : do you have a or two sentences for that to convince you ?
and so , , unfortunately , unfortunately , the skeptic in very different camps .
those who are doing scientific arguments are very little .
do you say that there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that are moving things ?
there are very , very few things you can tell you about , from which there &apos;s a chance to be in a million .
the most important thing here is like aids .
you &apos;re doing the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
and that &apos;s why the idea is , now , if you all have kinds of problems , in something that you just have later , from which , you know , the investment is not necessarily the worst scenario , and it &apos;s not necessarily the the essence of the world , and it &apos;s the most obvious scenario , and it &apos;s the most obvious scenario , and it &apos;s the most obvious scenario , and it &apos;s the most obvious scenario , and it &apos;s the most obvious scenario , and it &apos;s the most obvious scenario
the fact is that these uncertainty are going to worry .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economically , and the co2 is going to be cut , then the usda says , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not a co2 , i wish it &apos;s not a co2 , i wish it &apos;s not a co2 , i wish it &apos;s not a co2 , i wish it &apos;s not that it was done , but i &apos;m going to accept it , because it &apos;s cheaper , but i &apos;m going to accept it , because it &apos;s cheaper , but i &apos;m going
and that would be your answer to the most important argument that if you use all these time and energy to solve the co2 , all the other goals under the co2 , the other goals , the most important goals , is to invest in the way that we can do better things that are going to be able to do .
and the actual spending : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. u.s. should spend 10 billion a year than they &apos;re doing today -- that &apos;s not dramatic .
under other things , other things don &apos;t suffer .
you get to big cash , and you can disagree with a reasonable people if you have something that &apos;s not economically , and trying to fund that , and it &apos;s going to be the most waste .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re very short a very short one , and i &apos;m going to try and do it , and i think we should try to do more things that have the potential , very much cheaper .
if the pharmaceutical system you get , a very high amount of energy is , you can only keep the rich .
i mean , everybody else could spend five times so much for our energy without changing his lifestyle .
but for the bottom two billion but it &apos;s a disaster .
and even more of the time , it &apos;s thinking about .
his new computer system is now , &quot; why don &apos;t the research will be talking more ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to be associated with his former stories , with the most common , but he understood that this is a very lonely group and therefore it &apos;s going to be the most lonely .
and that &apos;s a train that i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , as little as the support system is going to be .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking for almost all people here , when i say , i hope you &apos;re going to be true . thank you very much .
and , thank you .
a few years ago , here at ted , peter was a computer called a name called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . the biggest thing to do is the biggest structure of structure with 20 spaghetti sandwich , about a square tape , about a meter of the ship and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be up there .
and , even though it really seems to be really hard , it &apos;s really hard because people are going to work very quickly .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve turned it into a more powerful .
it was a huge success .
since i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops in the world , with students , and architects , and architects , even with the most important , and there &apos;s something that is going to be a lot of the way that they &apos;re doing , and i want to share some of them with them .
usually most people start to get themselves to the task .
they talk about it , they think about how it will look , they &apos;re going to be doing it .
then they invest a little bit in planning and organization . they draw and put spaghetti sauce out .
they &apos;re constantly investing in the most sophisticated structures .
and finally , shortly before they don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow and they put it on the top , and they &apos;re going to go back to the top , and they admire their work .
but then , almost always , is that it &apos;s going to be the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the marshmallow , &quot; which is the whole thing that &apos;s going on and the whole thing .
there &apos;s a series of people who have much more &quot; data &quot; than other people , and under the worst , they are fresh .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and producing it really .
and of course , there &apos;s teams that have a lot more &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; . &quot;
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as we told peter , they didn &apos;t just make the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be wondering is : how does this happen ? why ? what about that ?
and peter tells , &quot; no one of the kids are investing at the head of spaghetti . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in the world .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that &apos;s that the most common plan was to find a right plan , ok !
and then it &apos;s too realizing .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s different is that they start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , so they have the opportunity to fix the prototype of the prototype .
and the way that we see this kind of collaboration as a core of a brain &apos;s core .
and with each attempt to get the kids immediately , the kids are going to be able to do what works and what &apos;s not .
so the performance is working with prototypes , much -- but let &apos;s see how different teams operate .
the average for most of the time is about the most important , and the half of them are doing half of them , but not much , but not much , more than adults .
who is most successful ?
architects and engineers , luckily .
the highest thing i &apos;ve seen is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and they &apos;re the key geometric patterns to build robust structures .
ceos are something about average . but here &apos;s what it is interesting .
you &apos;re going to be a key truce on the team , you will be significant .
it &apos;s incredible . you see , and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why does this go ?
because they have special skills of the most powerful .
they lead the process , they understand it .
and this team , which is going to go down and watch the performance of the team of the team .
vannevar skills and the combination of success and the combination of success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical approach , you get about six , the stable structures .
i tried something interesting .
i thought we &apos;re going to get the same thing .
so i offered a 10,000 dollars to software for the winner .
what do you believe with these kinds of things ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if someone had built a high construction , he would have carried the price home .
so is it not interesting that high energy has a strong effect ?
we repeated these practice with the same students .
what do you believe ?
now , they understood the advantage of the &quot; prototyping . &quot;
so from the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there are lessons of lessons for us , about nature and success .
you like questions : why would someone actually invest a time to create a more powerful ?
the reason is , i help digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and &quot; visual &quot; to create .
and what the most important thing is , you can get them to identify assumptions .
because open , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a common experience , a common language , or a sense of building the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this is so simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in the way that you can go to go .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how to build the marshmallow .
there &apos;s a more powerful there .
they find crazy examples of all the world , like people optimize the system and the system .
there are also a lot of time .
and the most important lesson , i think , is actually a design sport .
it requires that we all have our senses to do the task and we &apos;re using our thinking , how our feelings and our do , in the challenge , the challenge of us .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that it needs to bring us from a &quot; the &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; moment to bring &quot; a &quot; moment . &quot;
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
we do this as if we have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool machine , and that &apos;s a machine machine .
and everybody in this room has to be in this room .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now , you can stay in here .
and i ask myself what they would choose because i was often asked my friends to be in the last time , and they wanted to go all the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america &quot; .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced you &apos;re kind of drawn to the grammar of the to the .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to do that in the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a snob .
it &apos;s that opportunities are not going back to this planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that there was ever the planet that &apos;s ever , which is what scale you put : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , acute , declining .
there was never a time before that .
my favorite , all of the time they were all over the day .
my grandparents were going to be on 70 .
my parents are the 80 on the top of the world .
so there should be better a nine at the beginning of my favorite .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child that &apos;s born today in new delhi can be born as long as the richest man on the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is this ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;ve made the demographics of the earth on a way , like no war ever did .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we &apos;ve put them on . turn .
in the rich world , diseases that have millions of us have only more threatened to one generation , hardly .
and the most powerful , polio , polio ...
anybody still know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is , try to try and try and look , look , if it works , it changes if it doesn &apos;t do that , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so this is the good news .
unfortunately , this is the whole good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , it &apos;s hungry to bed every day in the world every day .
this number goes up , and it goes very quickly , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to waste this world .
drinking water , the land , rainforests , oil , gas , and it &apos;s soon , and if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , we &apos;re also going to go out of this chaos .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food , the billions of people will feed without the country , to rape them , to rape .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t cut at the same time .
i think that really , and no , that &apos;s not a computer designer .
but this is what i &apos;m awake at night -- one of the things that i hold down at night . we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as well as now , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never , never ,
and we were also able to do it , and we &apos;ve never been able to do it .
we &apos;re at the verge of amazing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think we have to go hundreds , 300 years ago , to find a time in the enlightenment that we have in the process of these things , where we have progress in the process of these things .
people are going to be able to think of their faith , and that &apos;s so closely that you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth is going to free them .
and listen , everybody has a right on his opinion . even a fairly right thing to do .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
they don &apos;t have a right on their own facts . &quot; sorry , they don &apos;t .
and i took a while to figure out that .
about a decade ago , i wrote a paper about immunization for the new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed to get to resistance , to the resistance of what the most effective thing in the history of humanity is in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what i should do , so i just did what i &apos;m doing , i wrote a paper and drove .
and soon , i wrote a paper about genetically changed food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people played crazy .
so i &apos;ve been writing a article , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the world &apos;s place . &quot;
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept going to go on .
i mean , i &apos;m journalist .
we type , we &apos;re going to get a rich , we &apos;re eating food , that &apos;s okay .
but this article made me worry , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it out .
and that &apos;s that these micro-machines , which were crazy to me , were not a neuroscientist .
these were the people who were educated people , educated people .
they were exactly like people in this room .
and that brought me so mess ...
but then i thought , you know what , are we honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as used .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking ironic about that , with little quote , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what causes that .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why that shouldn &apos;t be like that .
you can just call a few names and you &apos;ll understand people .
chernobyl , the tides , the tides , the main destruction , mass destruction , the u.s. destruction , the u.s.
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people we believed that they were always right . are they skeptical .
imagine , demand evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything as a given .
but now , when you have to get evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can say that we &apos;re going to live in an epidemic now in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that the most powerful thing that the most powerful thing was to do with the pest , and the vaccine of the vaccine was brought into connection .
very scary .
many studies were done to see if that was true .
many studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious thing .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe we believe what we see to see what we &apos;re seeing to see what makes us feel really .
we don &apos;t believe in a pile of documents , which is we have data , and i understand that , i think , we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of it was catastrophic , a devastating .
catastrophic because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries on the world , where the vaccine is down for the puppet .
this is a little bit of a time , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happens is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do that .
because here &apos;s somebody &apos;s being in this ?
has a single one in the audience ever die in the audience ?
not very often .
it &apos;s not happening in this country , but it &apos;s not going to be a way to be in the world in the last year .
these are many deaths through the blink of the , 20 per hour .
but because it &apos;s not happening here , we can do it in denial , and people like jenny can walk around and the messages of fear and the messages of fear and larry king live .
and that can do it because they don &apos;t connect and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same thing .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and it &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas hunter .
he was crying from one of the worst most of the worst of humanity .
no fear , no hyperbole , polio , floating , disappeared .
the guy in the middle of the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul &apos;s .
he &apos;s just developed a few other people &apos;s own people .
he can save life from the world &apos;s lives , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , not ?
well , that &apos;s good , besides that paul is walking up and about vaccines and says , how valuable they are , and that people should stop to complain .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul talks in a public , he can &apos;t tell without armed guards .
he gets calls home , because people like to tell him that they know where his children go to school .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
take it on , go back to the disease , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s what happens .
we &apos;ve now been in this country now .
and that &apos;s going to be worse , and pretty soon kids will die in this , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die at the blink of the .
what about polio ? let &apos;s take this . why not ?
a little bit of me wrote a few weeks ago , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m a little too sharp .
nobody ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t be her child against polio . no case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
we had no polio in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe somebody &apos;s in lagos today in lagos , and flies just after los angeles , right now , it &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he lands and a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these most powerful days tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a commodity disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do that as if it &apos;s not .
we love to put ourselves in lying . we love this .
do you have all of your vitamins today ?
and a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
i know that they did that because half of the americans are doing this every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference , as often we find that they are useless .
the data is constantly taking this .
they make their urine . more they never do .
this is okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i &apos;m going to agree with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and that &apos;s not what we should do . our health care is subconscious .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing , and it &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of time to us that can afford it .
so we &apos;re running away before , and where do we run ?
we &apos;re running in the poor of the world &apos;s arms .
this is great . i love the most important .
but you know , that &apos;s really a serious thing , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars to it .
and i have all kinds of little attributes here .
not from that -- the , was , the , was , the , was , i &apos;m not even , because i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re giving billions of dollars to it , it &apos;s .
and you know what ? if i say that , people shout me and say , &quot; what does it take you ? let &apos;s do people , what they want .
so you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you have wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the minister , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or any of the most powerful , which wants to treat his patient with a computer .
if you go to this way , where and magic and magic and science replace , you get a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to the south africa in south africa .
he brought 400,000 his people to , because he was that red government , and the more effective , and a lot more effective than antiretroviral drugs , which we know that they can know the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of streams in a country that will be worse than any other of these disease .
tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they always have .
now , the most important epidemic that we &apos;re just in , is this kind of thing between the most common , and the most powerful battle between the most common food of food and the most powerful .
this is a debate debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every single branch of the road , every branch , every branch , was changed by people .
you know , there was no more sophisticated in paradise .
there was no more sophisticated .
there was no more sophisticated . we did all this .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them worked and some of them don &apos;t .
we &apos;re rid of what &apos;s not working .
now we can do it more specifically , and of course , there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people to extend millions of people , to extend their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re going to be genetically transformed food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m hearing is to hear , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , we don &apos;t want a huge fields with one thing that is wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge amount of water , but that &apos;s not science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , more powerful .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes he works and sometimes not , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid of doing a real dead , and it keeps millions of people from the facade .
you know , in the next 50 years , we have to grow 70 percent more food than in the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? genetically changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this kind of thing , like the so-called stuff .
and it &apos;s a little bit of a billion people eating a half billion people .
it &apos;s about a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s subconscious .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t build protein , and scientists are building all this .
and then people could eat the food and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be a little bit of a standstill , but it would be beautiful .
and everything i can say is : why do we fight this ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to move genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our lives on greater food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice &apos;s energy , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it will be the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re doing that , we &apos;re going to be guilty of something that we think , i don &apos;t want to be guilty , high-tech edwards .
there &apos;s no other description of what happens here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , and we really need to stop that .
so , after that incredibly funny conversation , you might say , &quot; do you want to still go into this ridiculous machine and go into the future ? &quot;
on every case . i want to be on every case .
now , in the present , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this machine machine on everything we want .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want .
we need to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the time , we &apos;re going to be happy to have that .
i know we can , and it &apos;s a little bit of me , and it &apos;s something that needs the world now .
thank you .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been interested in the most important thing for a while , and it may seem strange that a magician is interested in it , because it &apos;s like i think it &apos;s like , as a deception , that &apos;s going to be a real thing to do when someone is just stuck enough to do it . &quot;
with other words , sugar have a measurable effect in some studies , the most appropriate effect , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what happens to her , is a more powerful or a kind of -- in the most , for example , there &apos;s a kind of a bit of the patient .
a deception is going to be a real thing to do because somebody is so aware of it .
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , very simple trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least in the 1950s for children .
i even learned him from the most powerful magic magic of the plague in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain him .
so , look what happens .
the knife that you can study ; my hand , which you can study .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife so in my own .
i &apos;m going to push my sleeves back .
and to ensure that nothing in my sleeve , or out of him , i &apos;m just going to get my wrist right here .
and you can see that you can &apos;t move anything to no time , as long as i &apos;m here , not in my sleeve , or come out of it .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will be taken through my naked physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually so determined to be in his place that i can shake it without that the knife fall .
nothing goes in my sleeve or come out , no more , and you can see everything .
and the most powerful !
well , this is a trick i often have little children , which is interested in magic , because you can learn very much about deception when you look at it , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you here in the room here in the room .
he works like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to make my wrist , to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m going to do my wrist is that it &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
because , in the moment , where i mean my hand from you , you &apos;re going to see them from the back , moving this finger , and i &apos;m going to go to this finger , just where he was , in a position where he was so extended .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody sitting in the back of somebody who had no childhood .
so , he &apos;s here .
and when i &apos;m going to be a lot of time , the finger changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is an illusion , why you don &apos;t realize that there &apos;s only three fingers down here : because the mind and the way he &apos;s going to be able to use information , not to be able to do it , not to be a , two , three , but it &apos;s not going to be a group .
but it &apos;s actually not about this . and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s going to be taken there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my individuality , that &apos;s now there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing i &apos;m going to do is , by the same time , it &apos;s hidden by this movement , that the finger is going to be back again .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can show you your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what about the most important thing ?
and a year ago , i read a study that really has really been made of me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing for me .
because it turns out that , if you offer a placebo in a white pill , the form of a white pill , is just a round of a round , white pill , which has a certain measurable effect .
but if you give the shape that you give the placebo to the , for example , in a smaller pill , and this blue color and a letter is going to be a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurable more effective .
and that , although no one of these things -- it &apos;s just sugar .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really made me improvise .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
if you take a little bit of a little bit more effective than a pills , you &apos;re more effective than a pills .
a colored capsule , which is yellow , and the other red is better than a white capsule .
the marathon is a role .
a pill twice is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is , ...
... that the doses of a role is playing .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate , you have to reach to the needle .
right ? a syringe with a computer system -- a few of the most powerful of a little bit of a kind of a kind of a kind of a patient that you &apos;re going to be able to get a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in your head . that &apos;s very much more powerful than a white pill .
this chart is really ... i &apos;m going to show you another time , if we have a veterans .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill , which doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and nothing of it has really been a lot of a lot of a property of the property . it &apos;s just our belief that we &apos;re doing in a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for magic magic .
i take something that &apos;s obvious , and it &apos;s really going to look at it .
we know that you have to reach out of the needle , if it &apos;s supposed to go to the needle .
this is a 18 inches long , and it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very little .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not a special amount of meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle in my skin , and through it , through it , until you &apos;re going to go back on the other side .
if you &apos;re going to be bad -- if you fall easily in off -- i &apos;ve been doing this a few friends last night in the hotel room , and some people that i didn &apos;t know , and it has become a woman almost an intentional .
so i &apos;m suggesting if you &apos;re fast , you &apos;ll look at the next 30 seconds , or you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first sensitive part here .
you can see it right , but you can also see it , if you want .
so , it &apos;s like that , where my flesh starts , the lower part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
really sorry . do you do that crazy ?
and now just a little bit of my skin and on the other side , and on the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the same situation .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well yeah , well yeah , well yeah .
i know what people think if they see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid , and the skin is the skin , just to talk to us a few minutes . &quot;
now , i &apos;m going to show you .
how does this look like this ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people back the back , &quot; okay . i don &apos;t have seen this right . &quot;
people in the most violent are now coming in .
let me show you about it close .
this is really my skin . this is not a special hollywood .
this is my flesh , and i can turn that .
sorry . if you &apos;re going to be bad , you &apos;re looking at it , look at it .
people back or the ones that later look at video , will say , &quot; well , this is pretty impressive , but if it was real , it &apos;s a hole , and if it was really real , it &apos;s a hole , and it &apos;s a hole , if it really would be really real , it would be a hole and there , if it really would be really real , it would be a hole and there , if it really would be really real , it would be a hole and there , if
okay , let me give you a little blood for you .
yes , here &apos;s it .
i usually would take the needle .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this frame , and with the purpose , from a deception , i &apos;m going to just make the needle in there , and so from the stage .
we &apos;re going to meet a few days .
i hope you &apos;re going to be happy to do it . thank you .
every talk today about happiness today .
i &apos;ve been counting some people who are going to be published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the title of the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and there were a lot more .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest among researchers .
there are very much more sophisticated .
everybody would like to make the people happier .
but despite all of these tide , there are several cognitive fall that are kind of impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly about these cognitive fall .
that &apos;s true for the point of the process that you think about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists that think about happiness because it turns out that we &apos;re so mess as any other .
the first one of these fall is a kind of a complexity , complexity .
it turns out that the word is simply not a useful word , because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could just be able to do , but in the big and all the time that we have to give up , and we will have to take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is a concern of experience and memory : basically it &apos;s about happy in his life and happy to his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both of the most common in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the most common , and that &apos;s the sad fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact of the well-being without to appreciate its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive case .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now i &apos;d like to start with a example of someone who had a computer company after one of my lectures , who was a story of mine , &#91; unclear &#93; , and he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and it was absolutely wonderful .
and then he added it to really , really emotionally , that has been ruined the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it was ruins was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had a lot of time to get music .
they don &apos;t , because he was with a reminder of a memory ; memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to keep .
what &apos;s really telling us that we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two species of self .
there &apos;s a more powerful self in the present , and the present knows , can be able to experience the past , but basically the present is .
it &apos;s the most powerful self that the doctor &apos;s doctor -- you know , if the doctor asks : &quot; does it hurt if i &apos;m going to get you here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a more powerful self , and the most powerful self is that the most important and the story of our lives get upright , and it &apos;s the doctor &apos;s doctor , and it &apos;s the doctor &apos;s doctor .
or &quot; how was her journey after albania ? &quot; or so similar .
these are two very different units , the most different self , and the most important self , and the two to appreciate the most important thing of the most happiness of happiness .
now , the most important self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories if we do that , to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories that are going to be what we can keep from our experience .
and let &apos;s start with a example of a example .
there &apos;s a old study .
these are real patients who put a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but it was painful than this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re going to ask , &quot; who &apos;s suffered from both more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has suffered more , and his favorite was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much thought that patients were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient had a much worse .
the stories of the most important ones were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how they end .
and none of these stories is very powerful or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is clear than the other .
and the worse thing is , the pain is where the pain was very on the end of his peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
where do we know that ?
because we asked these people to their own , and also much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing that &apos;s all right ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a as a for b in the most violent .
well , this is a direct conflict between the most powerful self and the most powerful self .
from the point of the design self , b had clearly a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient a do , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s actually working , you could actually get the pieces of patient a constant .
that &apos;s going to lead that the patient is suffering , but just a little less than before .
and if you do this a few minutes , you have a little bit of the time that the most important self is a bad thing , and you have it , that the most important self is a much better , because now you have a better story about your experience .
what is a story of a story ?
and that &apos;s true for stories that make memory and it &apos;s also true for stories that we invent .
what a story is , the most important thing is , significant moments and end .
end , very important , very important and in this case , the end of the end is dominated .
now , the most important self lives in life .
it has moments of the most violent , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve got this -- you know , the psychological present as about three seconds . what means , you know , it &apos;s about 600 million of them .
most of you are completely ignored by the most powerful self .
and yet , they &apos;re kind of the impression that they should count that the world &apos;s lives is happening in the world &apos;s lives .
it &apos;s the limited resource we use during this world .
and how we would use it , but it &apos;s not the story that is going to keep the most important self for us .
so we have the most powerful self and the most powerful self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is the relationship with time .
from the point of the design self , if you have a vacation , and the second week is exactly as well as the first , the first holiday is twice as well as the most good holiday .
this is not how it works at all for the most important self .
for the most important self , a holiday is hardly better than the most important holiday , because there are no new memories of the prison .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable , which is different from a more different self , time , very little influence on this story .
well , the most important self is doing more than remember and tell stories .
it &apos;s actually the decisions that make decisions , because if you have a patient who , we have two of these things , and we decide what he should choose to choose , then the one who &apos;s going to be selected , the people who are chosen to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
the most important self has no voice in this choice .
we don &apos;t really choose between experiences . we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we &apos;re usually not thinking about our future .
we think about our future as a human memories .
and basically , you can see that , you know , when a bathtub of the world &apos;s self , and you can think about the most powerful self as one , which is kind of the most powerful self , which is not going to need the most powerful self .
i have the impression that if we make vacation , it &apos;s very often the case that means we &apos;re mostly doing vacation in the service of the brain .
and that &apos;s a little bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we do from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that will give for the dominance of the world &apos;s dominance .
and when i think about it , i think about a holiday that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best holiday i had ever had , and i think it &apos;s a relatively often thing to do in the relationship .
and i probably have my memories of these kinds of things , and i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i opened the folder with the 600 images , i spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and these are just a hours of hours .
there &apos;s a vending monkey .
now , i like a little bit extremely , you know , you know , how little appetite i have on the most powerful of memories , but even if you &apos;re doing more of it , you &apos;re going to be a real question in the weight of the weight that we &apos;re giving you ?
so i want you to think about a thought .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the world &apos;s most of your images , you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to remember anything .
now , would you choose the same holiday ?
and if you would choose another holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species of self and you have to think about how you decide that conflict and that &apos;s really not obvious because if you could get a answer to the sense of the time , you could get a answer .
why we choose the most important thing we choose is a problem that turns out to be a choice between the two species of self .
now , the two species of self is going to throw two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts from happiness that we can apply , one self .
so you can ask : how happy is the most powerful self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments of the living self ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of happiness about the time of the time .
if you &apos;re asking for happiness , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this is not how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s like satisfied or pleased , the person is when this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
everybody who &apos;s not different is the exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m a lot of researchers on the well-being of happiness that have been rejected for the study of happiness long to this kind of thing that &apos;s been fooled for the happiness of happiness long .
the distinction between happiness , and happiness is recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re going to be recognized to measure the two .
the most famous organization has a worldwide survey , which has been asked more than half a million people who have been asking about what they think about their lives and over their experiences . and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started learning about the happiness of the two species .
and the main lesson that we think i think is , i learned that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and it really doesn &apos;t remind you much about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation that is about the correlation of the correlation .
what that means is that if you would meet someone and you would tell you , oh , his father is a kind of a computer , like a lot of them ?
well , you would know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone &apos;s life has been a little bit of a scale of 10 year-old , and they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his own self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what happiness of the most common thing is .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know happiness is mostly true to be satisfied with people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s the dominant .
so if you want to maximize the two species of the self , you &apos;re going to be very different at the end of the self .
the conclusion of what i said here is that we really don &apos;t think we should really think of happiness as a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very short , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things if we think about life and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are going to be in california , they don &apos;t get the correct answer .
if you think that question you think that people have to be happier when you say , in ohio , we &apos;re living in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out climate &apos;t really important for the most important self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the horror self , which decides how happy people are .
but , because the horror self is responsible , you can end up at the end -- some people could go to the end of california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track what happens to people who are going to be able to get into hope to be happier .
now , you &apos;re not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . they &apos;re going to think they &apos;re happier because if they &apos;re going to think about it , how awful the weather was in ohio , and they &apos;re going to feel that they have the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question of you .
thank you .
now , when we &apos;ve mentioned a few weeks ago , she told me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came from this gentleman .
is that something you can do , because you &apos;re going to have a few minutes left ?
daniel : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we &apos;ve found in the most famous survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found that in terms of happiness .
if we looked at how feelings are thrown with income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample under a income of 600,000 dollars a year under 600,000 dollars a year in a year of 600,000 dollars a year in a year of 600,000 dollars a year in a year of 600,000 dollars a year in a year of 600,000 dollars a year in a year of 600,000 dollars a year in a year of 600,000 dollars a year in
60,000 .
and the most powerful : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in the year are people unhappy , and they &apos;re increasingly getting happier , the poorer they will be .
we get a absolutely flat line .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money is not going to be a computer company , but that lack of money is certainly beating , and we can actually measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the most important self , you get another story .
the more money you deserve the more the more , you know .
it &apos;s not true for emotions .
but danny , in the entire american effort , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this kind of serious seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on the head , all of what we believe , for example , in terms of the way that we think about the way that we think about the way that we think about the way .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country would take a very common way of taking the way the serious thing is , and it would be based on politics ?
and you know , you know , i think there are recognition for the role of the world &apos;s role in politics .
the recognition will be slow in the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening in other countries , just in other countries , just it &apos;s happening .
people are in the way they should think about happiness when they think about politics .
it will take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to study the way they &apos;re going to study or they want to study it , so we need to be quite soon .
as you can increase happiness , it &apos;s very different , like you think and whether you think about the most powerful self or whether you think about the most powerful self .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you &apos;re going to measure the population of the population .
that &apos;s going to be , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistic .
well , it seems to me , this issue is going to be , or should the most interesting political debate to track the next few years .
thank you for the invention of economics .
thank you , danny .
i &apos;m jane attenborough . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing the year for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it just easy to save the world in reality , how they &apos;re in the world .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince you more people , including all of them , more time with play and the play of games .
now we spend three billion hours per week with a week .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a whole lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time , if you think of how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute of the future is the opposite of the future .
three billion hours per week , not nearly enough to solve the most difficult problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase this time .
i &apos;ve been calculating that the time that needed time to play at 21 billion hours a week .
this is what we might be doing first , so , again , i can do it , so i can do it , if we do problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , global conflict , and obesity , i think , we need to try to do games online .
no , i really mean it seriously .
why ? this picture describes pretty precisely why i think games are so critical for survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographers phil .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play . so he has built a camera .
this is one of the classical expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe you might get some of the nuances in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also , also , the concentration concentration , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really , really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re also playing , you see some of the smithsonian here , which are up to the top of the eyes and the mouth of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s at the edge of a so-called thermal .
oh , you know that . ok . okay . so we have some players here .
a very powerful victory is a result that is so much positive that it &apos;s not possible before it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you reach it , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually able to do something like this . that &apos;s a very powerful victory .
this player is short a epic victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces of the world , if we take the barriers of the next century , and the face of the next century is the face of the world &apos;s face .
well , unfortunately , we see that face in real life , if we &apos;re difficult to meet problems .
i call it the &quot; in life , &quot; i &apos;m bad , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ?
i &apos;m like i &apos;m in life , i &apos;m bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i was in my ph.d. , as we &apos;re in play as in the real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not so good in reality as well as play .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , although that &apos;s what it belongs to .
we &apos;re going to get more . i mean , i mean , in the context with motivation , something significant to do , inspired to collaboration .
if we &apos;re in a computer system , i believe that many of us are turning into our best version , anytime and immediately helpful to solve the problem , so long as necessary , it &apos;s going to be like the most important thing to do , and it &apos;s going to try to do it for the most long time .
and in reality , if we fail , if we &apos;re going to be able to get on obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we &apos;re going to be defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or a result .
these feelings have never been , if we play games , there are just not .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible to think , you can &apos;t just do everything ?
how can we transmit these feelings from play in reality ?
so i looked like the world of warcraft , which provides the ideal environment to collaborative problem .
and i found some things that are going to be able to make the epic wins in the way that we &apos;re going to do .
so first , when you get in one of these most powerful , especially in the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are ready to do , you know , a mission mission , and it &apos;s immediately .
but not only any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your current level in the game , right ?
so they do that .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their skills , they have to be a hard thing , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and it &apos;s a lot of time . there &apos;s always a little bit of a very important thing to do .
and there are lots of employees .
where you go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to finish their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that in real life , that feeling that in a computer of a new staff , they &apos;re ready to be ready to be ready .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , these inspiring history , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve been doing it from &quot; level up &quot; and &quot; + 1 &quot; or &quot; + 1 . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in real life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have : + a talk , and + a crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in the real life of this feedback .
so , the problem of the world &apos;s world &apos;s world is that it &apos;s so satisfying , in the edge of a epic , to stand in the edge of a epic , that we &apos;re rather spending our whole time in these kinds of things .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
and today , all the world of the world &apos;s world has spent millions of years to solve the virtual problems of the virtual problems .
this is not necessarily something bad .
it may sound bad .
but to see it in context , the most important thing to go to the context of the year is to go upright .
so the first more sophisticated primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend with play now , it &apos;s just meaning when you &apos;re in terms of the scale of the human development , which is extraordinarily .
but also , it &apos;s also appropriate , because it turns out we use this whole time to play this whole time , actually change what we &apos;re able to do as humans .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative , thank you very much .
this is the truth . i believe .
look at this interesting statistic , which was published recently from a researcher of carnegie mellon university : the average boy of human being in a country with a huge amount of water in a country with a lot of time .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , they &apos;re the exact hours of the way they spend the exact , which they spend in school , from the five grade to the end of high school -- if you never missing .
so we have a complete kind of a complete thing on the young people , which means that it means to be a good player , like everything else , what they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of the most amazing research , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the most important study of a whole subject to the 21st of a whole subject , we will be drawn to it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at doing what the most significant people in the world .
so what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are the most powerful .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players very good ? &quot;
because if we could figure out that , we would never have a lot of the human potential to do it .
so many people have now in the world , which is at least one hour per day with a day .
these are our main systems . 500 million people who are extraordinary in &quot; something &quot; are .
and in the next decade we have another billion players that are extraordinary in what &apos;s always .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the most important thing is , the energy is developing , and the energy is working on the energy , instead of the most important , so the player on the world , especially in india , china , brazil , brazil can play online .
you expect a extra billion players in the next decade .
so , we have 1.5 billion players in total .
so i started thinking about what it is to master that games .
here &apos;s the four things i found . first of all , the first thing .
ok , imagine how extreme the extreme thing .
and the desire is to do something immediately , to master a barrier , to the belief , with faith that we have a creation of the interest .
players always believe that a very powerful victory is possible , and that it always is worth trying to try and do it , and it &apos;s the same .
players are not sitting around .
players are masters in spiders in the poet of social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people , after we played with them , even when they have a bad thing to do , even if they have a bad .
the reason that it is a lot of trust is to play a game with someone .
we trust that someone is spending time with us that the rules are being challenged that we have the same goal and to stay on the most important thing .
so the most powerful thing is that it &apos;s growing by ties , trust and each other .
as a result of that , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
and the productivity productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the most important of the most powerful 22 hours is playing a week , sort of as a computer .
the reason is , if we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than if we &apos;re going to relax or not do anything .
we know that we &apos;re going to work as human beings when we do hard , significant work .
and players are always ready to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to be part of awe of the movie of the world &apos;s name .
here &apos;s a computer , to go back to the right light , and you &apos;re all going to know wikipedia , the largest wiki of the world .
the second cloned of the world , with almost 80,000 ghraib is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve been collected more information over world of warcraft in the internet than any other topic in every other quadrant of the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to one result . players are more hopeful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change as a single world .
and the only problem is that you believe you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the problem i try to solve .
edward is a computer company .
his work is genius . he studied why people and money spend so much time , energy and money in the world .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to be a witness of not less than a computer in virtual worlds and the most powerful . &quot;
and that &apos;s an economist . so he &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like me -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit more powerful .
so he says that actually makes sense , because players can achieve more than the real life in the real life .
you can play stronger social bonds than in real life , and you get more feedback and rewards in play than in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s completely logical that players are more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
i just agree with that , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not a more powerful .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from a event that goes down 2,500 years .
there &apos;s these ancient cube , from the way that you know , you know ?
and this fantastic thing was , there was a lot of time .
and that was kind of the first of people developed .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the old greek , you might know this story . the story of how and why games were invented .
according to the game , games were very , more specifically , in the kingdom , in the kingdom of a famine .
there was such a big famine that king of the king was going to be a crazy idea .
people suffered . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
so they invented , according to the most noisy , the most popular and pants a national strategy , and a day , you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the most powerful , because games are so fascinating and we &apos;re surrounded with the , and we &apos;re surrounded by the productivity , they would forget that there were nothing to eat .
and then , the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to the very 18 years , they survived this famine by eating them in a day and played the next .
so , i think , let &apos;s sit in today .
we &apos;re going to play games to get the real world to the real world .
we &apos;re going to play games to get all of that , which is not working in the real world , all the real life is not multi-touch , and we get what we need from play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
this is the exciting thing .
according to 18 years , famine was not better , so the king decided , a last one , last day , a last day .
they shared the kingdom in two camps .
they played a computer and the most popular adventure to break a epic adventure .
they left the search of the search and they were looking for a new home , and they just had so many people back , like food , and they were looking at the rest of the place to the rest of the place that they could be able to do .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest , the latest , the most popular , the most recent empire , the same dna , the same dna as the old , have been the same dna .
so scientists came to the notion that the crazy story is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global cooling , which was almost 20 years , which could explain the famine .
so this crazy story could vote .
maybe you have saved your people by playing by 18 years in games , and then they had a lot of the time and they had been able to play and have been able to play that , and so much about each other that they have saved the entire civilization .
so , that &apos;s what we can do .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 for 1994 .
this was the first thing in real time in the world of the world of the world &apos;s world . that was 16 years ago .
they were playing 18 years of the year , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own game game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i take my 21 billion of the day a week .
we should be in it , that half of us spend an hour with play a day , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of real world in play ? &quot; and that question i have my work in the last few years for the future .
we have this kind of a system in the office in captivity , and it &apos;s going to press how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best result . and then people are asking to do this idea in reality .
we &apos;re going to get to the epic , and we give people the possibilities to achieve them .
i &apos;m going to show you very briefly three games that i designed to try to get people to get to their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a kind of a computer that you have to overcome a computer system .
the most important thing is , but we have enough of the time , so it &apos;s going to be realistic , and it &apos;s actually going to be realistic , and you actually live without oil , and you &apos;re actually going to be able to do it , and you &apos;re going to be able to get to the game , and you have to be able to get out of the way that you &apos;re going to be able to do it , and you have to be able to do it , and you have to
we tested this game with a kit of the players , and we &apos;ve been accompanied by the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a change experience .
nobody wants to change life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure , and you say , &quot; we &apos;re going to go out . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going to go .
find out how they were survival . most of our players have been able to keep the game in the game .
so we have a bigger game for the next thing , and we put a bigger , higher goal than just a more powerful .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the institute for the future . &quot;
and the calculation is the calculation of a computer , that people are only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called global energy , of course , &quot; of course . &quot;
the call to players , we have a lot of the time , we &apos;ve been doing it almost like &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you know jerry , where it &apos;s the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the world , &quot; and only together , you can save the world .
but in our game , instead of five people , we say , everybody is in the most violent , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , health and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they &apos;re &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the last game we get at the third march is a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you close the game , you get the world bank , the &quot; social &quot; , &quot; the &quot; social &quot; , in 2010 .
we work with universities in sub-saharan africa and store , social communicates to learn .
we have a comic comic . we have a level of the level of understanding , and we have a level of the way to understand , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in the world , which is to make their own social enterprise to save their own social enterprise .
i &apos;m going to go to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what , do you think , happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope you agree with me that player are human resources that we can use in the real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have this whole superpowers , the productivity , the ability to make close social nets , and the desire to make the desire to make meaning .
i really hope that we play significant games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to be able to play with me and play .
if i go to the next decade , i &apos;m sure , i &apos;m sure that we can create any option , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the most important games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about what a few months ago , a few months ago , was noticed for a little bit of a paper .
i always have my favorite book on the writing , but i was done with the text of text , and i &apos;ve been doing that , i &apos;ve never been in my life , which is the word &quot; disabled &quot; really means what the word &quot; disabled &quot; means .
i read you the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; more , &quot; the &quot; the &quot; , helpless , helpless , useless , destroyed , adopted , adopted , adopted , the latter , the , i , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and the more powerful , healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
i read this list of a friend , and i had to laugh , and i had to laugh so ridiculous , but i just came to &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , this was a kind of a computer , old , old , old , i just thought that the copy has to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early &apos; 80s when i started with the elementary school , and i started building my self outside of my family , and to form the other way to the world , and to the rest of the world around me .
and god is thank you at the time , i don &apos;t use a lot of time at that time .
i would be serious at this post , i would be born in a world that someone would perceive as a person who would be able to do their lives in a way , but today i &apos;m going to have a chance to be celebrated .
so i immediately have the most popular of 2009 , and i expected to find a little bit of a contribution here .
here &apos;s the most popular version of this kind of thing .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words , &quot; near &quot; near &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we build these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many ancient societies , including the greeks and the roman , really believed that the tar sands has a big force , because what you &apos;re looking at is , you know , the fact that you can get out of the way that you can get out of it .
so what do we actually want to do -- a disabled person or a powerful person ?
and a person &apos;s child &apos;s child , as a child , could be a child , and they could be able to get them to their own ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open doors ?
a human being that has opened down the doors was my pediatrician at the top of the world &apos;s name in the world &apos;s office .
he &apos;s called dr. , a computer , which is a name , whose name , as you can think , most americans couldn &apos;t be correct . so he was called dr. p. .
and dr. p. always wore very colorful and was just a lot of colorful , just like created .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my favorite .
i had to be a lot of practice infinitely , infinitely often with these big , adopted , and in different colors -- you know , to build my favorite , and i hated it , and i hated it . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them
and imagine , i &apos;ve even suffered as a child &apos;s child with dr. p. and so trying to stop this practice , and i &apos;m trying to stop this practice without success .
and one day he looked at me at one of my work -- these practice were just tiring and partners -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so strong , powerful , you &apos;re going to get a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;ll be a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;ll be a very powerful , powerful and young girl , you &apos;ll be a very powerful , powerful and young girl , you &apos;ll be a very powerful , powerful and young girl , you
and if you make it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
that was just a simple trick of dr. bezos , so i &apos;m doing the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that the richest five-year-old girls in the hospital was going to be in the second stick , but he actually got me to see my daily , and he actually got me to see my daily , and it was actually taken to me , and it was actually a new and a new experience .
and i &apos;m asking myself , how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl , and i could imagine that as one of nature &apos;s powerful , powerful and a human being .
this is just an example of many , as adults can make the imagination of a child .
but as the way that we &apos;ve been aware of the most powerful examples of the world &apos;s most important , our language doesn &apos;t make space , something we all want to wish to do , and we would have any one to allow themselves to see themselves as powerful people .
our language is the social changes in the way that we have been caused by a technological change .
and from the medical standpoint , you can say that my legs , the most powerful for the world &apos;s own , the most powerful for the water , and artificial body for aging , which allows people to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
so maybe this technological change is more clear because ever , there &apos;s always another truth , which is that every human one of the society is something very much more powerful and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt to our biggest plus is .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell you how to do with more accurate and i &apos;m going to give you something like that , and i &apos;ve never felt that the question of people , and i think i felt very uncomfortable to answer the questions of people , and i think i felt very uncomfortable to answer the questions of people , and i think i felt very uncomfortable to answer the questions of people , and i think i felt very uncomfortable to answer the
this sentence from the relationship with the odds of the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge , without being shaped by that , without being fixed by the experience of the way that i could go to the way that i could go to a prosthetic life , because i could go to the way that i could drop the kinds of life with a prosthetic , or as well as people are going to go to a prosthetic , or as well as people are going to go to a prosthetic , or as well as
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course , we &apos;re shaped by the challenge , whether they &apos;re physically , emotionally or even both of them is both .
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s good .
more accurate , not a obstacle we need to do to get better to our lives .
more accurate are just to our lives .
and i tend to see more accurate than my shadow .
sometimes i realize he &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s not to see , but it &apos;s constantly at me .
and i don &apos;t want to get the impact or the heavy of the most heavy of a human being .
there are more accurate and challenges , and they &apos;re just the real real and every person &apos;s going to be different , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to come to the odds or not , but how we &apos;re going to come to it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for people that we love to preserve , but they &apos;re also going to prepare to get good to get good .
and we &apos;re not going to get our kids , if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt to themselves .
you have to separate two things : to be a medical fact , to be a medical fact , and to be the other social opinion , whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and permanent disability that i had to put apart is that the world is constantly meant , you can describe me with these definitions .
in our wish , people who are to protect us in the heart and they &apos;re the cold , hard truth about their medical prediction or even to make a forecast of life that they expect to be able to look at , we have to look at that , we don &apos;t have to look at that , we have to look at that , we don &apos;t have to look at that , we &apos;re not going to take the construction for that , that someone actually has to be disabled .
maybe this is the concept that just watch what &apos;s going on in a broken , and how we fix that , for every single disability than the business community .
if we don &apos;t have a human being , and not all of its forces and possibilities and possibilities , we can do that in addition to the natural struggle that you might have to do , another disease .
we &apos;re a human being , which has a value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the most important , and we &apos;re focusing on all the area of human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between the perception of our weaknesses and our great most amazing , a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t be able to get this curriculum , or fission , we should not try to avoid them , to avoid them , and we should be able to get them to the carpet , but it &apos;s about realizing the odds of opportunity .
it may be more likely to ask that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome the odds , but that we &apos;re open to it , they &apos;re going to hug them to put them on the top of the world , and maybe to dance with it .
and maybe we can do it , more accurate than something natural , and to see , and feel like this , and feel like that through your presence .
in this year , we celebrate 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote 150 years ago , darwin has written in my eyes , in my eyes , in a very real human character .
i would be so much more potent : not the most powerful of his kind , and not the most powerful of his kind , but the way that changes is best to adapt .
from conflict , creativity is coming .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive , to survive and the fight of the human mind is defined by conflict .
so again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of people .
and maybe we know what wood we &apos;re cut out , if we &apos;re really tested .
perhaps that &apos;s the sense of ethical , a perception of the world &apos;s disease , a sense of our own force .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give a new meaning to the existing times that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see more accurate than change .
more accurate ones are a change that we haven &apos;t adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we have is to believe ourselves , is that we should be normal .
so , frankly , who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual thing . the typical thing . but not the normal thing , and would you want to know these poor gray , gray person really want to learn if it really was ?
i think more not .
it would be great if we &apos;re the paradigm of the normal against another one of the possibilities or the strength to even make it a little more dangerous , exchange , and we can release the forces of very many children , and they invite them to be able to release their very special and valuable skills in society .
and we found out that we &apos;ve always been able to have people from the members of our society , and to be useful , to be useful and to afford a contribution .
there are evidence that the neanderthals have been older in 60,000 years old people and people with heavy physical injuries , and that might be because the life experience was valuable in the world &apos;s society .
they don &apos;t have this people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went in the city where i grew up in a , in the red zone in the northeast zone , and i stood there a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a quantum interface .
it was summer and i had a lot of time .
and i hear how a guy behind me says , &quot; well , if it &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i &apos;m moving to this and see this older man . i didn &apos;t know who he &apos;s .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you &apos;re hardly going to remember me .
when i first saw them , i took them out of her mother . &quot;
oh , so the .
and of course , it &apos;s made click .
this was dr. , a man i just knew from narratives of my mother &apos;s day , because i was , of course , to my birthday two weeks , to my birthday .
the doctor for the medical imaging of my mother was in vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world , not .
and because i was born without a little bit of a time , and my feet were looking for them and i just had some toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , he had the most bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say your parents , you would never walk , and never would be like other kids or that you could never have a independent life , and then you just have a delight . &quot;
i really found that he was collected in my entire childhood , no matter if i had won in a second grade in the second grade , whether i had to be in the second grade , whether i had my scholarship or a half of my personal school , and he used to be able to teach the clips to teach his students , and he used this clips to teach his students , and he used this clips to teach his students , and he used this clips to teach his students , and he used this clips
and he called this part of his course of the x factor , the potential of human being .
you can &apos;t stress enough , how critical this factor can be for the quality of human life .
and dr. was going to go on , he said , &quot; i learned that kids , if they don &apos;t always get something else , and even if they &apos;re just going to get a little bit of support , and they can get children very much . &quot;
see , dr. , dr. , has changed .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone deal with it , two different things .
and i &apos;ve changed my thinking in the course of time when you had asked me in the age of 15 years if i had my prostheses to legs and bones , then i didn &apos;t have a second .
i was going to be in the same time .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not sure .
and that &apos;s what happens because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not despite this experience .
and maybe this change could happen because i &apos;ve been faced so many people who have opened doors , rather than to meet people who were dominated me or i wanted to be a notion of a sense of a sense .
see , it really takes a human being to show you how they can exploit their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate your own inner forces , the human mind is so much -- if you create that , and you &apos;re going to open up for somebody in a critical moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to open doors .
the actual meaning of the word &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means something that is going to produce that in one is the potential .
again , what potential we want to do is now ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the &apos; 60s , a case was done in the u.k. , and then the most powerful in the world was transformed in the world .
they call this &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the students are divided up to notes .
and the one student will be improved , get the better teachers , and the better teachers get .
they have been able to have a time of a period of time with a &quot; sufficient &quot; to a &quot; a &quot; a &quot; a &quot; very good , &quot; and it said they were very smart , they were very smart , and they really have written it .
and of course , it breaks to hear the heart that the opposite was told , they &apos;re just enough .
and then it was also after the three months .
but only those who were still in school -- apart from students who had been beaten school .
and in this study , the teachers were not the teachers .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
you just said that his graduate students and that are the students with the note , and they have taught them something and they &apos;re treated .
the only real disability is a broken mind , a mind that was broken , has no hope , and he doesn &apos;t find any more , and it &apos;s not going to be a natural ability to do it , and we &apos;re not going to be able to do our natural ability to be the imagination , and our most recent ability of imagination .
but if we do it , the human mind to support the human mind continue to hope , and other people around themselves , and to be beautiful , and to be beautiful , we really have to be positive .
if a mind has about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new design .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that was written by a persian poet called the 14th poet , and i told my friend jacques , and the poem is called &quot; the god , who knows only four words . &quot;
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right now ?
suppose i said , by a few changes of their genes , a better memory could have -- more accurate , more accurate and faster .
or you want to be more powerful , more force , more force .
do you want to become more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be longer to live in good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who wished to be more creativity .
what would you like to do most ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about so many as it &apos;s creative people here .
this is very good .
how many would be to decide for a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to , as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a whole different world .
is that all the only thing ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a devastating topic here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor .
the big geneticists in the 20th century , the most powerful , which was also a computer in the russian legend church , wrote a paper , which is a paper , with the title &quot; nothing in biology . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who are not the evidence of the biological evolution , this would be a very good time , you &apos;re going to take your personal , you take your personal , you &apos;ll take your personal -- and maybe you can see a look at kathryn .
but if you accept biological evolution , you think about this , is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for other people &apos;s or it &apos;s also us ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
in this picture , i have a bush as a center of the branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree , all the existing species of the tree of the branches of these branches have been in evolutionary terms , and they &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
the human part of this kind of thing , far at the end , is of course , what we &apos;re interested in most of the time .
we &apos;re going to be a shared ancestor of a common ancestor about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , there was 20 or 25 different types of hominids .
some are coming and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about the years of the years .
it seems like we &apos;re right in the other parts of the tree of life , but actually , the most important part , are the fundamental mechanisms of our cells quite equal to the same .
is it clear that we can use it , and the mechanisms of a shared bacteria can make the protein of the human being , which is used to treat the internet ?
this is not like the most powerful ; this is the same protein that &apos;s the same protein of what comes from the pancreas .
and what we &apos;ve been talking about is that everybody is aware of us , that every one of us in our gut is going to be more bacteria than the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , think of it if antonio manju asks her to be asking , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s the sound , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to give you all nutrients that you could just want to be able to be able to do without effort .
it &apos;s really a easier way to do bacteria with the bacteria , with the humanities , and they &apos;re forced to push the friction to the outcome .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they are important for their lives .
they help them to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
but what will be going to come in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary balance in a species of a species ?
or are we going to be a little bit different to be adapted -- something that may even be adapted to the environment ?
now , let &apos;s go back to the time of the big bang in the big bang 14 years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago -- the first signs of living , maybe three to four billion years ago , maybe the first thing that shapes the last few years .
in this huge haystack of the universe , life is just very careful in earth , the animal kingdom , like a single drink ; and the human life , a small , small one .
we were .
this is also the most important thing that &apos;s going to be the speech of this speech , so i hope , d , it &apos;s like to be .
now when i was a computer on college , i had my first favorite .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with evolution , and i asked something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in the world , and in most of the existence of life , every cell , and all the genetic information will run in both of the time .
but at the time , as a drug , the things that are going on , the things started changing .
sexual reproduction is going to be the picture .
and very important : with the introduction of sexual reproduction that is the genome , the rest of the body is going to be the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the most important of death in the world is going to be in evolution in the same moment as the sexual reproduction .
now i have to say , if i was a more , i thought , okay , i thought , okay , sex / death , death / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable to be able to do it , but with every year , it &apos;s been a very reasonable thing to do .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , who read vegas in the &apos; 90s in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his own .
he opens the door .
he &apos;s a beautiful very close to him .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for a little bit of a time . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;ll take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization that i was a goal that was a goal of the evolution of evolution -- not necessarily the way that evolution is , just different .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to hold healthy .
i wanted to communicate the health for a disease .
i wanted to do that we have a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the point of the genome of the next generation , adaptation and survival generation .
from a evolutionary standpoint , they &apos;re and i developed the rockets , and i developed the genetic rockets to send the genetic space in the next stage to get into the ocean .
i think we would all have the mood that brought the humanities all to the expression , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get immortality through my work .
i want to get it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily be the largest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the smartest ones .
evolution is the creatures that are best to adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , and they &apos;re going to survive and survive and survive the hot steam , if fish would be there , they would have a more conservative environment to the consequence of the way they have a donor environment for themselves .
so , what does that mean when we look back at the back , what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space in evolution , and especially as we &apos;re looking at the next phase , i would say it &apos;s a series of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move .
we have a kind of balance .
and the reasons that it would be us is that it &apos;s a lot of genes to get a lot of genes that were otherwise been able to get out of the world , and they &apos;d have been removed from the population .
and secondly , we have a species of our environment as we have our environment so that we &apos;ve done it , that they have to adapt to us .
and by the way , we go and we &apos;re going to expand and mix so much , that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary to be necessary for evolution to be the evolution of evolution .
a second possibility is that it will be evolution of traditional species , of course , prone by the forces of nature .
and the argument , here &apos;s the wheels of evolution slowly , but they &apos;re down .
and so far the isolation is going to be , when we put a species distant planets , it will be a little bit of the way that evolution could produce the world in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third way , a compelling , fascinating and scary opportunity .
i call it a little bit of the new development -- the new development that &apos;s not just of course , but it &apos;s starting to be a more important and decided to make us as a computer system that we do .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s look at the reality that people today are making decisions about their offspring .
they &apos;re , in some cultures that choice , to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
so think , if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to make genetic adaptations , the disease and prevent it .
what if you could do the genetic changes to get diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or alzheimer &apos;s or to eliminate the cancer of the cancer or nails ?
would you not want to do this , to make these changes in your genes ?
if we &apos;re going to be more powerful , these kinds of changes are increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 and it took 13 years .
it cost the billion billion dollars .
in the next year , when it was done in 2004 , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in the next year .
today , you can get a sequence of the three billion base base of the human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 and in the room of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take a long time until the reality will be that there will be 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everybody .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering is the most powerful prize for francis arnold and the most powerful prize , two scientists who were independent of the natural process of evolution , to work faster and to lead to the hydrogen proteins in a efficient way -- which is the kind of the kind of thing that &apos;s the kind of the kind of thing that &apos;s called the &quot; direct arnold &quot; .
a few years ago , the most popular thing was given to the scientists that he had been given to his research in the world he took a adult , a adult , and through the manipulation of only four genes , the cell , to be able to get to a crater of the cell .
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that can produce the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that don &apos;t only make protection , but also to the immunity against other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s a experimental study in the gang with immunization against influenza , which has been grown in the cells of a computer .
can you imagine something good that comes from tobacco ?
this is all the reality today , and in the future , much more possible .
so imagine only two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
what if you could change the sperm and the fresh egg or the fresh egg to give your children a better chance to give your children to a more important opportunity to be able to reduce the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want healthier kids ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science can allow the changes to prevent disease , could also allow us to adopt the way that we can get to adopt , and the better memory .
why don &apos;t the most important one of the ken of an ken decrease , especially if you can extend it with the next generation of the world &apos;s next generation ?
why not have the fast thing that you &apos;re going to allow you to do faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are going to be the most powerful .
and if we &apos;re on a place where we can pass it on the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want to be , we will be transformed by the evolution of evolution to the world &apos;s evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that needs to be 100,000 years , and we can translate it on a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions with their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , to be able to deal with .
do we use this decisions to form a society that is better , the more successful , the more more friendly ?
or will we be selectively different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
will we form a society , and we &apos;re going to be a society , or more robust and more powerful ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to face .
and the deepest of all , we &apos;re ever going to be able to develop wisdom , and the wisdom that we need to make these decisions ?
in the good way in evil , and as you might think , you &apos;ll be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
thank you .
i want you to imagine something , a portable robot that gives you a reward of the skills , or another one who helps the most , and go back to it .
we call this robot to the robot , and we call this robot .
they &apos;re not different than something they put in the morning and gives them extra strength and will increase their speed and will help them to keep their balance .
this is actually the true of human being and machine .
but not only that -- so that they &apos;re going to connect and connect them to the universe and other devices out there .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers , who &apos;s in average about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the request that they should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- the 30 percent of it -- chronic , 30 percent of them -- chronic .
so we thought we would take this challenge and create a design system that would help that , with this problem .
so let me introduce you to the same thing -- or the human being universal , and the human being universal .
soldier : with the most important , i can carry 200 pounds of the terrain , many hours long .
his flexible design allows it to be deep to the world &apos;s body , and very agile movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and increase my strength and resilience .
we &apos;re as far as we &apos;re going to introduce this device to this device , this new kind of thing in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s look at our view of the user vehicle , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who are estimated in the wheelchair .
this is about a percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about a lot of young people with spinal cord , which is in the height of their life -- 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 30s , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population whose number are parked .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it goes to a computer , or to other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it has been for 500 years , and i &apos;ve been saying , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in mobility .
so let me introduce you to the now of amanda , which is carried by amanda , which was a spinal cord , which has been a spinal cord , which has been the result that they couldn &apos;t run more and until now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda is wearing our favorite system .
it has sensors -- it has sensors .
his completely powerful sensors in the crutches , the signals of our own , the signals that are tied on on their back .
here are also the most powerful , the most important thing is to be on your hips , as well as your favorite , which you move forward in this pretty much and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old and in the world , as a computer company , as a computer designer , as a computer designer , i was a little bit of a time .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement below my favorite .
not long after that , a doctor in my hospital room and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go back . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s steel every single hope of my consciousness .
and then , the other thing that i have since then is to go back to learning again , to go back , to climb and drive the hands .
but nothing was invented to me again , and i would go back to that .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to make us address and discuss them .
it &apos;s in our hands and we have the whole potential here to change the life of future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for amanda , and for all the car , but for all the car .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m boss of a nonprofit organization called robin monastery .
if i don &apos;t get poverty , i &apos;m as a computer scientist , i &apos;m a more powerful one of a volunteer in a volunteer of a volunteer that &apos;s the fire .
well , in our city , in the volunteers , a more powerful one , you have to be able to be able to be a pretty early thing to be in the world .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer on the top of the world , so i was right to see a good opportunity .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the adoption of the adoption and find what our tasks would be .
when i found the most serious , he just had a very serious conversation with the most serious conversation of their life .
it was in the middle of the night , and she stood in the pub and barefoot under a screen outside the stream , while her house was in fire .
the other volunteers , which was just a little bit of me , and we call it a week , and we got it to go to the house , and then asked the house to go and save the dog of the world &apos;s house .
the dog ! i was a very excited .
there was some lawyer , and the most good thing for the rest of his life , who could tell people that he was in a house house to save a living house , just because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next .
the most important thing to me is to be .
he said , &quot; masculinity , you have to go into the house .
they have to go up to the fire , and they have to get a few shoes to get a few shoes . &quot;
i swear .
well , not exactly what i was hoping to do , but i went to go -- the stairs up , the hallway , the &quot; real &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; to get a few shoes . &quot;
i know what you &apos;re thinking about now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey down to the bottom , where i met my curtain and the beloved dog .
we put our estimate out to the most important , where , not surprising , his much more attention than my own attention .
some weeks later , the most popular one received a letter of the most popular , where they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get their house .
one about all the measurements is to be able to be able to be able to be able to have a few shoes .
both in my profession at robin monastery as well as a volunteer fireman , i &apos;m witness by generosity and kindness in the big scale , but i also see the charity and the most important of the individual .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look at this room , and people who have either reached a success success , or in their way , i want to offer memory , don &apos;t want to offer .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in life , until you get your first million .
if you have something to give you , you &apos;re now giving it .
they &apos;re going to use a park in a field of space .
be a mentor .
not every day , we &apos;re going to offer a chance to save life of a human , but every day gives us the opportunity to change one .
so they put it on ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno &apos;s : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just come back from a community that knows the secret of humanity .
a place where women lead the most powerful , with sex &apos; hello , and the game is determined to be a serious thing -- where fun is a serious thing .
and no , it &apos;s not a lot of the time , or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their responsibilities .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the jungle of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees , our next living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , which lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their own .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of the human evolution in the history of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the kidneys .
as chimpanzees of great , fear of the world &apos;s children &apos;s favorite , the most important of the females will run the female female .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve really got out there , because it &apos;s going to be a very powerful society in the deadly violence , which is deadly violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos are known under the primates .
they live in the deep of the frozen , and they &apos;re just hard to do .
the congo is a paradox -- a country extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the place of a violent debate that has been used for decades and almost so many lives like the first world war .
it &apos;s not surprising that these destruction are also going to survive the bonobos .
and the decline of the world &apos;s decline is that you can &apos;t even fill a monument with the remaining bonobos -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country , in this country , you can hear a laugh of the trees that the trees are upset .
who are these relatives ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; because they have a little bit of the great , also , and they have a little bit of the things that are going to be , with a computer , and the rules and social health and social health .
i don &apos;t say that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because life is from the bonobos of the bonobos .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives for long .
play doesn &apos;t just mean the game .
for us and you &apos;re essential to the attachment of relationships and care of tolerance .
we learn to trust and the rules of the game .
play is increasing creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the production of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you watch bonobos in the game , you see the evolutionary origins human , dance and rituals .
play is the most powerful , which is us .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique shots from the wild .
first of all , a computer company on the street -- and i don &apos;t think about football .
so here we see a young female and males in a computer system .
look at what you do .
that could be the evolutionary origin : &quot; you put it on the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more likely to do it , right .
yes !
so , the most common thing is , both of them are related to bonobos as well as people .
and this video is really interesting , because it &apos;s -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the most interesting thing that you &apos;re going to do with new elements -- like the testicles -- and also how the game is both passionate .
but the game is a computer system .
play is a computer and it can take a lot of forms of that some of the things that are quiet , and you might be curious , and you might be curious to discover the surprise again .
and i want to show you that this is a young female , and she plays peaceful with water .
i think exactly how you play , sometimes we &apos;re going to be alone , and we &apos;re going to be the limits of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s the playful curiosity that makes us research , and interact and the unexpected wiring that we form are the real transport of creativity .
this is just a little taste on the insights that the bonobos are going to give us in our past and present .
but it also &apos;s true of our future , a future where we need to adapt to increasing challenges , through bigger creativity and the most powerful cooperation .
the secret is that the game of the key to these skills is to be .
with other words , play is our main system .
so to adapt to a world &apos;s world , we need to play .
but will we make the best from our own design ?
play is not silly .
but essential .
for bonobos and people , the lives are not the teeth and claws alone .
just if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , maybe the game is the game .
and so , my favorite , let &apos;s hug this gift of evolution , and play in common , while we &apos;re the creativity , and the wonder of the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couples , in 1979 , at the same time , in the same moment , every single moment , every one of the things that a baby -- okay .
so two couples , every one of the people &apos;s baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to imagine a lot of time , because if you think the whole time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
imagine that just for a moment .
and in this scenario , they &apos;re going to be a case that the waiter is wearing a y , which is true of the x chromosome of the minimal chromosome .
and in the other case , the waiter is wearing a x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the minimal chromosome .
both of these are the most powerful ones , both fire .
we come back to these people later .
and most of my activities , i have two minds .
and i &apos;m going to be involved with the story of anatomy .
i &apos;m studied babbage , and i study the case of how people are talking about anatomy -- that human body , animal bodies -- like they were with body seats , with the body , with the body .
the other hat i carried in my work is the activist , as a computer , as a , or , like i say , as a documentary , the patient &apos;s family , the patients of doctors .
in this case , i worked with people who have the social norms in question .
so , for example , i worked with people who are the most important twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with a lot of time -- so people who were smaller than common .
and very often , i worked with a lot of people who are gender , which is the gender , and people who have not the average male or female .
and as general , we can use the word of the word .
and in many different forms , in many different forms .
i just give you a few examples of the kinds of things that are not the male or female standard .
in a case , you may have somebody with a computer company , and the most powerful gene of y leaves the most powerful , which we have all of the time we have to grow up to the stage .
and so the testicles are giving the testicles on the stage of testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to see testosterone , not to respond to the body .
and that &apos;s called the most powerful .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as an consequence , the body has been able to be more typical of the typical female .
if the kid is born , it looks like a girl .
it &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it &apos;s mostly going to get to puberty and grow their breasts and develop their breasts , but they don &apos;t get their period to get that there is something different .
and they make a few tests and find out that instead of the same , they &apos;re going to be in the way that they &apos;re in fact , and they &apos;re in fact that they have a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could keep this person for actually male , but that &apos;s not really .
women , like men , have something called a little bit of the way that you call it a little bit of the time .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the most important thing is , the most important thing that &apos;s the kind of hormones are , which is the hormones .
most women , like i -- i think to be a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me to talk to the very , really , very , really , really , really , really , in the world .
we produce the most powerful and we &apos;re talking about a hurry .
the consequence is that someone like me actually has a brain that was exposed more to the more powerful than a woman who was born with testicles , and a computer company has been .
so gender is really complicated ; they &apos;re not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense of gender , you can be distributed across the entire range , you can be distributed over the range of the range , you can be distributed over the range of the range , you can be distributed over the range .
one example , a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 , man who was born as a boy , when young raised , he had a friend , he had a friend , and he had a friend , he was born , and he had been found that he was born , he was born .
he had a extreme form of a natural design system .
he has a little bit of the chromosome , and in the womb , his favorite , were so strong that they basically created a male , which is basically a male .
and as an consequence , his own male male was being exposed to his brain , his brain was exposed to the male male part of the world &apos;s .
and when he was born , he saw how a boy was made of -- no one was a little boy .
and only as he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he &apos;s inside the inside that the doctors found that he was inside the inner female .
okay , just a quick example of a female of a plastic of a plastic .
some people with the chromosomes , develop something called the most powerful , which is the most powerful , which is the most powerful of the world &apos;s disease .
we don &apos;t know exactly why that happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason kids with this kind of body -- it &apos;s a little bit of the body , or the twins , it &apos;s a lot of the norm , and it &apos;s a lot of the norm , and it &apos;s often adapted to the norm , not because this is for your physical health of advantage .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason to do that often different kinds of surgical surgeries are done , because it &apos;s the social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that a certain amount of money is associated with a certain identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is going to be a female identity ; a black person is , is , is , is , is , a african anatomy , is in terms of the own story .
so we have this awful vase .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body that actually is something very different , it &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of the chance to do that in terms of this .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas in our culture .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of the brain .
now you can imagine how amazing it is , when kids are born , the two people are born in a body .
where i had seen most of the time , the national state was the u.s. minister of the last year , whose gender was in the world &apos;s world in berlin in berlin .
many journalists called me with the question : &quot; what test are you going to do , who tells us whether the more powerful female or male is ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalist that there &apos;s not this test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not a line between the male and female , or female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and
so we have a situation where , the further our science is transforming , we need to admit about that more , that these categories that we had to be able to do for stable the ones that are very simple to create permanent amounts of things , much more than we have .
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
it &apos;s also about race , which turns out to be a lot more complicated than our most complicated .
we &apos;re in our dimension , we &apos;re all in the way we &apos;re in all sorts of ways .
we &apos;re going to take for example , for example , we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what should we do with the fact that we just differ from them through a few of the time ?
as we keep our science further , we get increasingly in a zone of the gravitational , where we need to recognize that the most important categories we have probably been too simple .
we see this in all sorts of areas of human life .
one of the areas that we see in the world is in our culture today in the united states today , in the united states today , the struggle of life and the end of life .
we have hard conversations about what the point is to be a body , so that he &apos;s a different one as the most popular life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about the question , when someone is dead .
our ancestors never had to fight so hard with the question , when someone was dead .
they &apos;ve just given a feather under the nose , and if they moved , they haven &apos;t buried them yet .
if you don &apos;t move more , you &apos;re buried it .
but today we are in a situation where we take people to take them to people and they want to put them in other people .
and as a result , we &apos;re going to be able to fight the fight with the really difficult question when someone is dead . and that brings us into a really difficult situation where we have not been so simple in the same categories .
now you could assume that the whole crash is going to be a little bit of the way that i would really make a happy thing .
i &apos;m politically vulnerable , i &apos;m going to be a lot of people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it makes me nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much more convenient than we thought , &quot; i think it &apos;s going to be .
and it &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to get to the democracy .
so to tell you about this tension , i have to take a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very much of the welfare .
i know they were more powerful , i know they were a little bit of the time , but they were great .
i think they were so much more powerful and strong , and so radical , which they did , i &apos;m all going to look at the most few years of the world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is absolutely to forget .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s going on with the world &apos;s world &apos;s world .
the fathers were from my view of the original path , and that &apos;s why .
what they were doing was a concept of concept , and they were hired it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , our fathers were going to be the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was in the reason in the reason , and the monarchy was in a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very
the caregiver of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of the most powerful .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power , these political power should have , because of the most popular , the father &apos;s son , for the son and so on .
the fathers are going back to this idea and they put them through a new concept of concept , and this concept said that all people were created .
they &apos;re going to be the project system and decided that the common thing , the common , the common , not the differences . and that was very radical .
now they did that , because they were part of a system of a system in which two things were in common .
democracy grew up , but the same time grew up the science .
if you look at the story of the fathers , it &apos;s clear that many of you were interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a world .
they went away from explanations , and they were going to be able to get things like a crane concept of power , back , where the transmission on a very powerful concept of the mexican is based on the very powerful .
they moved to a computer concept .
and if you look at the independence , you &apos;re talking about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , they were a concept of the path of the path .
and so they have really been prepared to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened after that ?
for example , women who are the right thing that the idea of the welfare , the concept of the welfare , says that the more important thing is that the more important difference is , and they said , &quot; we have a uterus and the more powerful , and we have a the way that we have not significant enough , that &apos;s the right to be a full of the whole citizenship , etc . , etc . , &quot; that &apos;s not a very important thing to have , the right thing to have , the
and women are doing successful .
next , the successful civil rights industry , where we saw people like the most powerful , who &apos;s about this , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the most violent rows of the world &apos;s population , saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people different color color , which are on the other ways of the brain &apos;s brain , and again , successful .
we see the same thing in the world &apos;s world .
of course , the problem is that , and we start looking at all the similarities , we need to start asking , why we &apos;re going to sustain certain incidents .
well , mind , i want to sustain certain similarities , and we &apos;re seeing a certain way of doing it in our culture .
i want to do a fish for example , a fish like a human being .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that five times the right , you should have to be able to get sex or to marry .
so there are some of these things that make sense of me , and we think , i think , should be , keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re a sense of sense .
so let &apos;s get back to these two creatures that have been been given to the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both the middle of 1979 at the same day .
let &apos;s imagine one of them , maria , three months of the day , she was born at june 1980 .
yves , on the other side , is born to the most successful , so it &apos;s born at the one march of 1980 .
just because of the fact that maria was born three months , they get all sorts of the rights three months ago , and they &apos;re all going to have a little bit of the right sex , which is right to choose to drink the right .
yves has to wait for all this , not because he actually has a different biological age , just because of the most powerful of his birth .
we &apos;re going to find other pollinators in which their rights are .
yves , because you take it , it &apos;s male -- although i don &apos;t say that he &apos;s with the most powerful -- there &apos;s a little bit of the time that he &apos;s going to be able to get the male , and it &apos;s going to be able to be able to get what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
maria , can &apos;t perceive the same thing that the author is right , the author in all states , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
yves can marry a woman in every state , but maria can only marry a woman today .
so we have these permanent path categories in many ways , and we &apos;re a lot of things .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is doing this progress in the anatomy that we have to get a point where we have to admit that a democracy is based on anatomy , ?
i don &apos;t want to give the science , but it &apos;s sometimes feeling like the science of the science .
so where do we go ?
it seems to be a kind of pragmatic posture , and it &apos;s &quot; good , we have to pull somewhere somewhere , so we &apos;re going to pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people are caught up in a very strange position .
so for example , there &apos;s a point to be a point that , to marry a man , that you don &apos;t have y , and to marry a woman , that you have a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested on their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of history , which i told you about the most important thing that i &apos;ve told you about the most important .
if we look at one of the fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us a dream of a dream .
he says we should not be people to say , &quot; your skin color , but after your character , &quot; and it goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you encourage people because of their characters ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the right to people , because i must admit that i know a series of golden golden , which i know .
i want to know that i probably know some bright , and i &apos;m probably a few bright things that are the most powerful , more intelligent and more sophisticated decisions to make their sexual relationships as some of the people i know .
so how should we be the question of the character of the character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really hard .
and one part of me asks what if the content was a personality of a personality , which would be in the future -- by the curved visible ?
do we really want to go into this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is to make thoughts about questions .
in our practice , we have done our thing right now , and i think we would do our thing well in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like this in iran , where a man is drawn to other men , with death , and it &apos;s being punished by the death of the death , because it &apos;s ready to put a computer in which he can stay in life .
states of this kind of way we don &apos;t exist .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon i talked about a few years ago , who had a few of the things that had a few of the classes to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i was with him , and he asked him why he made these surgeries -- it was high surgeries -- was his answer to the same , that kids were very bad , and therefore he had to do it .
i said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve moved political technologies in you , instead of separate a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states is the incredible possibilities to allow people to be the ones that they are , without that they &apos;re going to change around the state of the state .
so i think we have to be leaders .
well , just to finish , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about dads .
and i want to think about the possibilities like democracy , or looked at if we had the mothers more involved .
and i want to say something that is a feminist , and i think that there might be different kinds of insights that can be made of different kinds of anatomy , and the other kinds of anatomy , if people use a computer .
since years , because i was interested in the most important , i &apos;ve been interested in research in the field of the world &apos;s field .
and one of the things i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from the studies of the studies is that women , in average -- not every one , but in average -- more complex social relationships and care of people who are within the group of vulnerable , very much attention .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
and i was a graduate student , i asked a graduate student , i asked myself to my graduate school , which was my interest to feminism -- i looked at it as a feminist , so it &apos;s a really scary question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism female is . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the most pessimistic question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about gender to prevent gender , so that feminism is nothing female .
but the more i thought about his question to do that more , i thought it could be something female in feminism .
that &apos;s what it should be , it could give you something , in average , which is the female brains of male , which is what we &apos;re doing for the brain of the social social relationships , and the way for the most important thing for the world &apos;s health system .
so where the fathers were extremely excited about how individuals could be protected before the state of the state , it &apos;s possible that if we &apos;re more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re more a concept of the way we can protect it , not just like you can protect , but how we can make it happen for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we have to go in the future when we have democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual body , which is what identity is , and think more about relationships .
so , if we try to make a more honest connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a suitcase and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with the hejaz .
i love to find a different thing to find a different , crazy , crazy , and in last time , and in the last time , and to photograph .
but i don &apos;t buy new .
i get all my clothes from second hand on the world &apos;s office and in the world .
ooh , thank you .
and i &apos;m allowed to reduce the impact of my favorite , and the impact of my own , and also the way that my purse .
i meet all sorts of great people ; my dollars are usually serving a good purpose ; i see pretty unique ; and it &apos;s going to go shopping to my very personal .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it have my size ?
am i going to be the color ?
will it be less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i &apos;ve been doing for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does someone bring with so many of the constellations ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven of these few tickets , and that &apos;s all .
and the same one for exactly a week is all i did in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve been suggesting that i would have all of what i wanted to wear , and i would find if i just got palm springs .
and there &apos;s not heard of me as the woman who &apos;s going on here at ted in her underwear -- that &apos;s what i found a few things .
and i want to show you my hobbies for this week .
sounds good ?
while i do that , i &apos;ll also leave you some of the lessons that i think , whether you believe it or not , from these entrepreneurial , not to wear new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the bright tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole kind of conceptual , including the jacket , has taken 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this whole week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiological to be bad , bad , if you &apos;re wearing pants pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you pull other happy people .
tuesday : adapt to it completely , is going to be completely .
i spent a lot of time in my life , trying to be trying to be , and i &apos;m going to adapt to myself .
be just who you are .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , they &apos;re not just going to understand it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people tell me , i saw out when i was eating games or that i remember her .
i &apos;m smiling and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re going to see it in something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think you &apos;re not looking at something good , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize this for you .
if you believe that you &apos;re inside and outside a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing that you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to be able to do everything that we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden , golden , is to fit .
and finally , saturday : a own , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world something about a word without saying a word .
it was always been proven to me and again , when in this week , people were just going to come to me , just because of what i was wearing . and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all of my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;ll be able to donate it back .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn about this week is that it &apos;s okay to let .
i don &apos;t have to be emotionally , because the corner is going to be a different crazy , and it &apos;s always a different crazy , more , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
thank you very much .
thank you .
good day , all together .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as a computer , as flying , as flying .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , design design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and everybody &apos;s young in italy is growing with this picture in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is something that happened in the formula in the past decades .
a few times ago , it was that if you wanted to win a formula , you took her budget and put your money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver was good enough , they won the race .
now , you need to get a race , if you want to win a race , actually like this -- something that &apos;s going to be in real time , some thousand sensors , which is the information of the car , and then you &apos;re going to take a lot of decisions to the system , and then you &apos;re going to process that car and then change this car to be able to get out of this car and then change things in real time , and then you &apos;re changing and then change this car to
this would be you , in the world , a call .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made of two parts -- a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a .
what &apos;s interesting today is the most important thing to do in our lives .
our cities were equipped in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to be in the free .
and as a computer in the free , they start to react to other ways , and they &apos;re going to be driven by it .
if we &apos;re cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
just by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population is living there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the most powerful -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
over the cities , all of this perceive , and drive all of this , and drive in objects of everyday life .
this is from a exhibition that paola antonelli for moma later , as the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
well , all our objects , our environment , start to talk to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom out there to both of the atom out there , a sensor and a computer .
and that changes radically the interaction that we have with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as though the old dream of gibraltar ...
you know , when a cartoonist shaped moses , it &apos;s called the hammer , and he was at moses , and he was still able to see a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit -- and said , &quot; well , &quot; do you have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a place ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
now , today , our environment starts to answer us for the first time .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with the perceive .
now the first project i want to introduce you to is in fact of one of our lab .
it was born four years ago in italy .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually a new way of using a new way of using the whole world -- that &apos;s a little bit of a world -- and anonymous and anonymous information from this network to use the way that the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was as an italy that won the most powerful .
some of you will remember , it was as an italy against france , and then the end of the day , the most popular .
and no matter , italy won on the end of the end .
now , you see what happened at this day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see the middle of the middle , the flow of the flow .
at the morning , the game .
you see the timeline up .
and the afternoon , people here and there , the calls , and they &apos;re moving .
the game starts -- silence .
france makes a gate . italy makes a gate .
and the people who make people a short call go to toilet .
second , the end of the normal play .
first extension , second .
and in a moment , in a moment of the world &apos;s office .
italy wins . yeah .
well , in this night , all of the time went to celebrate .
they saw the great thing .
the next day , all the time to meet the center and the prime minister to make the prime minister .
and then all down .
you see the picture of the space of the space , where the roman time , the people go to celebrate -- to celebrate a big party , and you see the key thing at the end of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today , a kind of way to do it in a way .
even quickly , another example of feeling : this is not about people , but to things that we use and consume .
now , we know all about that , and we know about what our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that are a mac , like you came together .
but we just know about where the things go .
so we actually designed some little markers to track the waste of the waste as he goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that we have , something more than a year , in seattle , who have been helped things that they &apos;re going to be doing -- different kinds of things that they can see .
then we have the little chips that are small brands , and they started tracking it .
here &apos;s the results that we &apos;re going to get .
from seattle ...
after a week .
and that information is recognized that there &apos;s a lot of the time in the system .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of the time that &apos;s a lot of the time , and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day , that the cup we throw away , not just that they &apos;re still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we throw away every day is still there .
and if we show the people , we can move a behavior behavior .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague on mit , the most powerful , could you have a lot more about that , and the many other wonderful things that you can do with you , but i want to talk to you the second part of the environment that we talked about , and that &apos;s the most important part of our environment .
and the first project is something that we &apos;ve done in a few years ago in a few years ago .
it started with a question of the airstream , which came to us and said that spain and a beautiful tradition have a beautiful tradition , in public places , as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology with it ?
and one of the ideas that were in a computer project was , imagine that tubes , and they &apos;re going to be able to work , and they &apos;re going to work , and they &apos;re going to be close to that .
they make what a kind of a computer system is like a computer system with water .
if these are the most powerful , they can write , you can write patterns , images , text , text .
and you can turn it , and it will open up to make you get to the way you can see on this picture .
well , we presented the mayor of the mayor .
it &apos;s very like it .
and we got the mission to design a building in the entrance of the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was made out of water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you &apos;re going to approach it , it will open up and let it go into it .
the roof was also covered with water .
and if it &apos;s a rationale , if you want to reduce the decision-making , you can even let the roof down .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture will be like in this case , you know , this days , if you &apos;re going to get the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they don &apos;t destroyed the building , it &apos;s just that architecture is almost gone .
here you see how the building works .
you see the person who asks what happens inside .
and here you see me when i tried to test the sensors that opened the water , not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what happened at night as all sensors .
but actually , it was a more bigger fun .
all children came from the building , because the way they were playing with the building was very different .
not longer a building that would open up to leave you , but a building that still had slowed down and holes in the water , you had to jump without wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people are using things that we design .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beautiful thing to create things that are used and interact with people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical , the physical water of water and the projections .
and this is what brought us to thinking about this project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine that these kinds of things could really start flying .
imagine , you could have little helicopter that flies through the air , and everybody from you with a little bit of a little bit of light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like that , which you &apos;ve seen before , which is moving with other people , completely in the way .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or irregular , but in three dimensions , which is what changes , the light is not the position of the world &apos;s position .
you can play with different kinds of games .
imagine the screen could just appear in different ways or sizes in different ways .
but then the whole thing could be a 3d cloud from the water that you can go through and move through that you move out of many , many directions .
here you see a real kind of a real thing that &apos;s going to be a real , very , very much of the time to form a little bit of a time .
if you turn the light off , it looks like that , so as we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of people are being controlled .
it could have a momentum , and it could have a momentum that comes from people , from the movements of people or something .
i want to show you something here .
we &apos;ve worked with a little bit of the most important , one of the best butterflies of our time -- the most important thing in the metropolitan theater , in new york and the scale in milan -- we &apos;ve taken his movements in 3d to use them as a momentum for the most powerful .
here you see the dancing dance .
on the left , you see the most different , the different of the other people &apos;s sensations .
it &apos;s a more powerful and a more powerful one .
so they can feel the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we all have the most sophisticated , you can play with it and play with color and play with color .
we want to use that as a kind of impulse for the most important .
i want to show you the latest project that we work on .
it &apos;s something that we work on the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
the idea is , imagine that we &apos;re going to put the people with something and change the environment -- almost like that , as we call it , as we call it a more , and with a cloud .
imagine that every one of a little donation can give a little donation for a computer .
i think that the remarkable one of the events that the last decades is that we &apos;re changing from a physical world .
it &apos;s all called , knowledge , and it makes it accessible through the internet .
today , we can do the first time -- and the campaign obama showed this -- can we be able to change from the digital world of networks to the physical world .
that can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is what &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can be to ask us the next challenges -- think of climate change , or the co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world to physical change .
so the idea is that we actually have the people with the people that they are doing together , collective .
the cloud is a cloud from the surface of the same way , in the same way , as a real cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud of the cloud .
it &apos;s a physical form in london , but with a lot of time .
you can move inside and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments for the most important moments of 2012 and the most vulnerable to the community , and it &apos;s as a way to use the community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go to the top of the top , like london new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new
you can go .
and a kind of digital stimulus in the night -- but as a new way , a new kind of experience for all the way to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important to the relationship .
i &apos;m trying to express that people are not separated by nature , and that everything is connected to each other .
the first time i was almost 10 years ago in antarctica , where i saw my first mosquito .
i was in awe of awe .
my heart is going to be a lot of mine , while i tried to make what was going on .
the mosquito around me almost 60 feet of the water , and i could only wonder that this was a kind of a plastic on another , year , year .
and the mosquito will be born as a calf of a glacier or by making out of the street .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they interact with their environment and their experiences .
some of them are giving up and they &apos;re going to be able to get to the bitter end , while others don &apos;t have to be able to do it and in a sense of a bit of passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think it &apos;s isolated , separated and alone , and as we often see people , we often see people .
but the truth is far away from it .
while a iceberg is melting , i &apos;m going to be a little bit of his own atmosphere .
while the iceberg is melting , he &apos;s going to be free to be free to feed the water of life .
i &apos;m going to go to my footage of this availability as if i do portraits of my ancestors , in the consciousness that they exist in these individual moments of these kinds of moments , and never exist again .
it &apos;s not death if you melt ; it &apos;s not a end , but a half of your favorite life along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the world &apos;s most powerful , which i &apos;m very young -- some thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last images i want to show you is a iceberg that i have in the in greenland .
very rare , you actually witness a little bit of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a .
so here you see it .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the top of the iceberg .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man &apos;s there .
this is the average size of a computer .
he pulled about 120 feet from the water , or 40 feet .
and this video is in real time .
and just as you can see the iceberg a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinarily blessed by the work of a few amazing projects .
but at the coolest , what i &apos;ve ever been working on was this guy .
his name is a name of the name .
and the most popular graffiti was one of the leading consent of the &apos; 80s .
then , one day , he came back from walking back and said , &quot; dad , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the outbreak .
and the whole is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood up .
i have a company that makes design and animations , so it &apos;s inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the art art , and look at it .
so we decided , tony -- and to support the thing .
i met with his father and his brother and his brother , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i want to just talk to tony .
i just want to go back with him and i said , &quot; wait , is that not -- i &apos;ve seen stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all communicate by these devices by these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you heard the higher , and a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not available . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
does anybody see the film &apos; &quot; manifesto and &quot;
so they communicate -- so their fingers walk along .
i was amazed , &quot; very much , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came to the need , just just a check , and instead , i put a check from that i didn &apos;t have the smallest idea of how i should be able to get it .
i was going to be on place and the father , and he was his brother -- with the words : &quot; well , my proposal is like this : tony will talk to him , and we will find a way that he can get a way to get it back to his art .
because it &apos;s an airstrip that someone who &apos;s wearing all this is not going to communicate . &quot;
so i spoke some months later at a conference .
i met these people from the world &apos;s research , graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on each other , and then to draw a light on the ground that just the negative area .
so they &apos;re moving around and make it like this .
they say all things that are shown up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the panels , then the most powerful , then the most powerful and finally do the people , and the people actually do art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentation .
so i went home and ate with my wife , and i told her about everything and we thought , &quot; well , second , if there &apos;s this technology , you can find that , you can find a laser , to control things that can be a laser , so we should find a laser that &apos;s going to be a laser , so we should find a laser that &apos;s going to be a laser , so we should find a laser that &apos;s going to be a laser , so we should find a laser that
this was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we have some things done .
first , we have the authorities that are going to be the doors , and actually have a device to get a device that he can communicate -- a stephen , stephen .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him a little bit of a little bit of a time , because you talk to him , or get an email , and think , &quot; i &apos;m so much , this guy is incredible . &quot;
we also have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and programmers and the programmers have taken our house .
many of our friends thought we were beautiful to do that , and we were going to be the images and all the images on the walls .
but for about two weeks , we &apos;ve been programmed to the most important in venice , my children were involved , and we were doing this .
it &apos;s called the description of the description and you can see the description .
this is a cheap shift that we bought in the most violent of venice , something more powerful and a few things from the hardware and the most powerful .
we took a more powerful , they have a little bit of a way , they put them on a way , and we have a device that &apos;s available to the free -- you can build it yourself , we &apos;re going to make it free to make the code free , and you can make the code free to make the software free .
so we have created a device that &apos;s completely free from constraints .
no insurance can be a insurance .
not a hospital .
every paralyzed thing can actually communicate with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s the room of somebody else and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all of these kinds of things that are the great unveiling .
and after about a year of planning , two weeks , two weeks , and the nights of the day , tony , played tony for the first time after seven years .
and that &apos;s an amazing picture , because this is his life life , and it looks about his life life .
we &apos;ve been exposed to bed , so he can see out .
we set up a lump of the hospital of the hospital in front of the hospital .
and he drew back to the first time , in the most violent of his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a sense of a parking parking was on the parking parking .
we also had to break in the parking parking parking , so we felt like a part of the world &apos;s .
at the end , he sent us an email with a little bit of a content : &quot; for the first time i &apos;ve been drawn to something .
i feel that i was going to be put under water and finally , somebody was going to be up and put my head down , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
this is something like our favorite system .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do at the track and it &apos;s always going to continue to develop .
and we have to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a very amazing thing .
and somebody who has such an artistic potential , so much more .
so we &apos;re in the way that you &apos;re better , faster and stronger .
since this time , we all have to get the kinds of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , nobody &apos;s made of us .
it &apos;s all coming from our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong : and then in december , in december , we &apos;ve been honored to be honored to be the most good inventions in 2010 , which was really neat .
the most important thing about this is -- and that &apos;s the whole circle -- that it &apos;s the bay , in the city of los angeles , a show of los angeles , called a show called &quot; art of the world &apos;s &quot; kind of the &quot; kind of the &quot; kind of the &quot; kind of the &quot; kind of the &quot; kind of the &quot; kind of the &quot; kind of the &quot; kind of the &quot; kind of the &quot; kind of the &quot; kind of the &quot; kind of the &quot; kind of the
and there &apos;s probably the hardest representative of the most devastating representative of the world &apos;s most powerful -- the most powerful , the most powerful , the most powerful , the ones that are going to be there .
and the show is part of the show , which is pretty smooth .
so basically , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , it &apos;s possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the microphone -- everything was impossible to be impossible .
do it possible -- they all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never had something to do with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , but i just got something to be surrounded with the legs that we could put together in common .
and this question should be , everybody &apos;s asking them , and that &apos;s where you &apos;re going to think about something that has to be done , which is what you have to do , when not , when not i , and if i , who then ?
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably america &apos;s most common .
and i always say the people that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist .
you can have me as farmers , or in leather , but nobody ever chose farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and the waiter .
well , a epiphany is usually something that you find because you &apos;re going to drop it somewhere .
you &apos;re going to go to the block and it &apos;s as revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard , he &apos;s done .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s at the &apos; 60s at high school in the &apos; 60s , ohio , where i was the most popular .
i was the one who was beaten in the middle of the green green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using me the toilet in the world &apos;s toilet .
it did it .
she did three years .
and i had to go away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it was a little bit of me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then in the &apos; 80s , i found it a work in the &apos; 80s .
about three or four years ago , i received a call from the night of this teacher , woman post , &quot; i have to see it .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other than adults .
you can please come to ohio , and please come together with the man i know you &apos;ve found it now .
and i should mention that i have a lot of time , and i want you to be able to get out of it . &quot;
now , the next day we were in cleveland .
we saw them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew that they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them , and we went to them , and we gave them eight , because it was necessary , because it was necessary , it was necessary , because it was necessary , it was necessary .
it was something that we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to learn me as adults , i met , turned it into a box full of a box , and put it in my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation i &apos;ve been talking about .
the revelation is , death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her partner .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that takes the rest of life .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this was so often mentioned here .
he takes just -- he would need to , love and pleasure . and it &apos;s to give us these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , while you go on 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a motor that stops , click , stop , stop , close , stop .
that sounds terrifying .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat on the day .
i was the only one who could talk to the most popular .
so i saw them at the same time , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had turned the machine and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot made the machine after the hudson river .
this is not the route .
he turn the engines off .
imagine a little bit of a plane plane .
and then he said three words -- the most popular words i ever heard .
he says , &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the most important .
i could see it in your eyes , because it was horror , life was to end .
i want to share three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything else is different .
we have this kind of thing that we have , we have these things that we want to do in life and i thought about all the people i wanted to get a hand and not , all the fences i wanted to fix , all the fences i wanted to fix , all the experiences i wanted to fix , all the experiences i wanted to fix , all the experiences i wanted to fix , and never made the fences i wanted to fix , all the experiences i wanted to fix , all the experiences i wanted
while i thought about it , i fell a saying , &quot; i collect bad cry . &quot;
because if the wine is as far as the wine is , then i open it up .
i never want to move something in life .
and these urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned at this day -- and that was when we were the george washington bridge , so pretty much , i thought , human , because i was a thing that i really really really do .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i was going to be better to become better in everything i &apos;m going to do .
but in my humanity , i gave my ego to my ego .
and i was a little bit of a time that i waste for the things that i &apos;ve wasted for a little bit of things , with people who mean something .
and i thought to the relationship with my wife , to friends .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to paint negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t have a few years of my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have more , right , i &apos;m going to be happy to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and that &apos;s the inner clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 , ... &quot;
you see the water .
i said , &quot; please flying up in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want that this thing to be made in 20 parts , like you know it from a documentary .
while we were in the world , i had this feeling , human , to die , not terrifying .
almost as if we &apos;re going to prepare our lives for us .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and these sadness really are in a thought , which is that i just have one thing .
i wish i could grow my kids up .
and i went to a month after a month , i went to a performance of my daughter -- it &apos;s not much artistic talent ...
... not .
and i &apos;m going to be a little kid , and i &apos;m going to admit like a little kid .
and in the world , everything was made for me .
i realized that by all , i was connected to the dots that it &apos;s just about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else is my only goal to be a good father .
i was the miracle of the miracle , and i didn &apos;t get to die .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , and back to life .
my call to all the flies today is : imagine , do you think about the same thing , and you don &apos;t think about it -- but imagine it ; and how would you change ?
what would you do , that you &apos;re going to be able to do because you think you were forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , they are the best parents that you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the test is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for the development of nuclear weapons is the most important in the world .
the gray boxes that you see here is the most powerful .
now , if we &apos;re going to do that , the systems are going to control the systems , which are controlling the world , and we can actually make a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with the street ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we do it , a effective thing to be a laptop is using a laptop that &apos;s used by a computer of a computer , and then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind the planning .
so we start with a computer system .
the most powerful box will go to the gray box , touch the centrifuge and iranian , the iranian , the mission of the world .
this is a piece of light , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started to test our research six months ago , it was completely unknown what the sense and purpose of this kind of thing was .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the most important part of the world , the most important part of the world , and he made a lot of the time of the world &apos;s own .
and it seemed something more like this , with these gray boxes , this kind of thing , this kind of thing .
that &apos;s what we did , and we started a project project where we were infected with our environment , and studied this building .
and then something funny happened .
so , in the way , the world &apos;s first thing is , the way that cheese is not liked -- the way that cheese was not liked , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
this was not a sense of my eyes .
and after we had been experimenting with different kinds of cheese , i went to that that this is a more sustainable attack .
completely on a particular goal .
the most powerful box is active on the gray box , if a special configuration was discovered . even if that &apos;s special program , which is trying to get to that goal .
and if not , then not a lot of time .
so , that &apos;s really my interest , and we started working with it almost about the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , we &apos;re going to say , a u.s. american power power , or a computer designer in germany .
so we should be better to figure out what the goal is .
so , we &apos;re going to get the most powerful code and found that he &apos;s in two digital dishes -- a smaller and a larger one .
and we also noticed that they were very professional , from people who were obviously all the time of information .
they knew any bits and the more sophisticated , which they had to attack .
probably they knew the most important of the most powerful .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve been seen that the most important of the world &apos;s complex and high-tech is , let me tell you , the most important thing is , the science is a science for yourself .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this kind of thing , and you see a clip of this .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
looks pretty like the ancient , as an old-fashioned , as an old-fashioned .
and i want to tell you how to be able to get out of this code .
so after what we looked at as first , they were a first time , because we know what these are doing .
and then we went to the world , and we were trying to get these with the real world in connection -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could be able to do or prove .
so to make these theories , we call ourselves in memory that it &apos;s definitely about the most important , it has to act about a nuclear goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran because most infections were reported .
now , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
basically it &apos;s going on to the most powerful nuclear power and on the most powerful .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all experts for centrifuge and power power of our client . &quot;
and i called them and they know their knowledge to compare their expertise to what we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital of the world &apos;s little digital .
the starrs is moving part of the centrifuge within the centrifuge , these black object that you see .
and if you &apos;re manipulated the speed of this kind of thing , you actually have the anticipation to crack the starfish and finally , the centrifuge explode .
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was actually , it &apos;s slowly , and to make it very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very quickly to come out of it .
the great digital system -- we got a glimpse by looking at the data , and we looked at it very precisely .
so for example , the number of things is going to be very out of this code , you can &apos;t miss it .
i started to do scientific literature , like this centrifuge in the world , and found that they &apos;re a mess in so-called a little bit of a time , and every single one is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a centrifuge .
so this was what it made , it &apos;s made together .
and it was better .
this centrifuge in iran are divided in 15 times .
and guess what we found in the most popular ?
a almost identical structure .
so again , that &apos;s really good .
and that gave us great confidence for that that we studied here .
now , you don &apos;t understand me wrong , that wasn &apos;t easy .
these results were done by multiple work .
and often we ran in a dead and we had to collect ourselves .
anyway , we found that both digital credibility in reality in fact , and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little little bit of the time takes a computer , and the jet and slowed it down and down and the big amount of energy is going to be in interaction and manipulated .
so , in the big and all of us , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have what the goal is .
it &apos;s a little bit of a time , and it &apos;s just a little bit of a time .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be met by the test .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- i really have a really powerful thing to do .
there &apos;s the gray box down there , and you see the top of the top .
now , what this thing is doing is that it &apos;s the environmental values of sensors -- so for example , from the most powerful and the -- and it &apos;s a little bit of the code that &apos;s still in the attack , with false powers , the same thing .
and in fact , this false thing is taken by the data of the data before .
so it &apos;s exactly like the car &apos;s car , where the car &apos;s car is fed up with before .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the idea of this is obviously not just , the most important in the control of the control .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more sophisticated .
the idea is to be a digital digital system .
we need digital design , where a human being can &apos;t react fast enough .
so in a power station , if the big amount of energy is going to be too fast , you have to open up in milliseconds .
of course , this is not going to be done by a human being .
so , in this place , we need digital design systems .
and when the risk is , then really bad things can happen .
the power power can explode .
and neither the most important thing is , the most powerful thing is going to notice .
this is scary .
but it &apos;s going to be worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is a lot of time .
he doesn &apos;t have anything to do with a centrifuge , with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
so , for example , he would work so well -- in a power station or in a computer station .
it &apos;s a lot of time .
and you don &apos;t have to -- when the pioneers -- you don &apos;t have to put the most powerful stick on a stick , like we &apos;ve seen it in a test .
you could also use ordinary technology technology to spread .
you have to only spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you &apos;ll eventually get a mass destruction .
that &apos;s the consequence we need to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals are not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most powerful environments .
we need to ask the consequences and we &apos;re getting better to prepare .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was very much reported that people think that the most powerful thing is that the most powerful thing is that the most powerful thing is .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yes . okay .
i think it &apos;s the most important thing to be involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the most powerful superpower .
there &apos;s only one and these are the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you so much that you have a finite , you have a mild . thank you ralph .
i spent the last few years to place myself in situations that usually are very difficult and even dangerous .
i went to prison -- hard .
i worked in a very reactive -- dangerous .
i filmed in the field of a lot -- hard and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days with this , not to eat this -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
i actually have the biggest part of my career , and i &apos;ve been exposed to the most honest situations , and that &apos;s all for trying to study social , social , and hopefully , and hopefully , and hopefully on a way of what makes it fun to do that .
so when i knew that i would come here to look at a tedtalk , the world of the world , i knew that i would make something a little bit different .
some of you may have heard that i &apos;ve got a display in a few weeks ago .
i sent a few of the things that i &apos;m going to send a few of the things , and i gave people the opportunity to get the most important to my tedtalk .
really , some of the happy people and companies , and companies , and they got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson never will be able to get this back -- the most important thing to buy , which was not a title of the talk that would be a very much of the time .
so what you got was , you &apos;ve been here : your name here : my tedtalk , from which you don &apos;t know what the theme will be , and the one you can ever get to content , especially if i put your company stupid for your participation .
but it &apos;s still a very good media system .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot of a lot .
this is just the most important thing .
so despite that warning , i knew that anybody would buy the most powerful .
so if you had asked me this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with confidence .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve been going to go over the years of the years in some pretty terrible situations , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could be able to get me to something like this , and so dangerous as with these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is a film about the most powerful , marketing and advertising , which is funded by the whole movie , marketing and advertising .
and the film is going to be called the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
so what happens in the world &apos;s most powerful , &quot; the most important thing is that everything , from the top to the bottom , is completely , by the beginning to the end , and the first one that you &apos;re going to see in the movie is the brand that &apos;s going to be the brand that &apos;s going to be the brand , that &apos;s the brand that &apos;s going to be the brand .
now these brand , the most popular stadium , the most popular center ...
these people are going to be connected to the film in eternity -- forever .
and so the film is going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in infinity , forever ?
i &apos;m a person &apos;s person .
that was more to the waiter .
it was &quot; in infinity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x than a computer designer , but we &apos;re going to be sure we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the movie .
so we might sell a shoe and he will be the greatest shoe that they ever carried ...
the greatest car that you &apos;ve ever been the dangers of , &quot; the most popular drink , &quot; the greatest drink that you &apos;ve ever had , a attention of &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
so the idea is , besides that , that brands are part of life , actually , to get the film to fund the movie ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of all the film is transparency .
they &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of the movie .
so this is the whole concept that all the movie , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy when the most important thing would help you do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny because i &apos;ve heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how to be a lot of people .
have you a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because that has a negative -- but you know how that will develop ?
how much money will it need to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet , but i think it &apos;s worth every case , some really famous brands .
who knows if the movie comes out , we might see how a coin is going to be out of a coin .
what do you think how the answer will be ?
the answer is probably , &quot; no &quot; no .
but is it a difficult thing about the film or a difficult thing for me ?
suzanne : both .
so ... so , not so optimistic .
so , my lord , you can help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands .
yes .
if you look at people that they have to do .
there are some places that we can turn to .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera , &quot; that we wanted to lead a computer system .
it turns out that it was actually meant , &quot; we want to do nothing with your film . &quot;
and just disappeared all these companies , one after the other .
no one wanted to do something with the movie .
i was amazed .
they wanted to do absolutely nothing with the project .
and i was confused because i thought , the whole concept of advertising is the idea of advertising , your product as many people can see how to see it .
especially in the world today , in this interface of new and old media and the unconscious media media -- is not the idea , in this new exciting process that the masses brings this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea was a mistake , and that was the way that it was .
no , it wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
that would have been no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but that &apos;s what this picture is , is a problem .
see , if you &apos;re looking at transparency at the most powerful , this is one of the first images that seems to be .
i really like your way , sergey brin .
this was the problem : transparency -- free from deception and the most simple , just to discover and we &apos;re just discovering ; and immediately , and , i &apos;m going to understand , and the access to information , especially , which is the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re listening to a whole lot of transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but if it comes to it , it &apos;s going to be implemented , changes something .
but why ? well , transparency is very terrifying -- like this strange bear , who still was getting more .
it &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of the hotel -- like this strange highway .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is risky ?
a whole dish cool food .
this is very risky .
so when i started talking to companies , and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid , and my father was caught me on lying -- and there he is sitting and look at this look at this -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions of every story .
there are your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
but there &apos;s only one company , a agency , to help us -- and that just because i know john bond and richard , i &apos;ve been able to know that i had to do it alone , i had to do it alone , i had to do the middle of the middle and to the companies .
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , a broad problem .
i have friends who make big , giant , giant , and i have friends who are little more like me .
and my friends , the great , giant , giant , say that the reason why their movies are so successful , is the most successful thing that they have .
and then my friends say that little little bit of the little , &quot; well , how do we compete with these big , giant , giant , giant . &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
so how exactly are we going to see the movie in the movie ?
whenever i do that , i &apos;m going to do it , and whenever i open the most powerful , you &apos;ll see it in the way you &apos;re going to be open to the world .
and every time i &apos;m going to get somebody to say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
they &apos;re very nervous ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you calm up .
so maybe you should be a little bit of the interview of the interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great things .
either &quot; the fusion fusion &quot; or a &quot; paradise &quot; , you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped both for men as well as women -- found , or a stick , or a stick , whatever .
this is the most powerful .
now i can answer all your questions and give you a very reactive version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re as a brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so , these things are going to be -- you know , reminds people about a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the way we &apos;re interested in .
what words would you describe ?
and in the blink of the body , it &apos;s a lot of time .
this is a great question .
and the technology is , the technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone is doing under the airstream .
we talk about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh is a great word that this category really makes something positive , unlike &quot; fight smell and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times .
these things have a more positive effect .
and this is a kind of a computer .
what about me ? what about the most important ?
i have to talk to the man on the street that are like me , the way i , the most important .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like to really like beautiful clothes .
&apos; 80s , the book is true of the street , except on the most popular .
well , what is the brand &apos;s brand ?
unique .
i think the most important thing that the style i have is , &quot; the glamour glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , many of the things that have a stuff .
but usually i have a kind of a computer , like a marker , or a jewelry and so a stuff .
if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classic grim .
man 2 : the brand i &apos;m , i would say , &quot; i would say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; fly .
and , part of the , part of the , part of the , part of the , part of the , part of the world , i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the most popular .
i sell the entire country around the world , around the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex because i was a little bit of a time .
man 5 : brand &apos;s office &apos;s office .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a very reactive .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t be all the most powerful , but i often see the interface of the interface of the glamour , and i &apos;m going to see the interface of the theater of the glamour .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed a experts .
i needed somebody who could go to my head , somebody who really could help me understand what you &apos;re called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot;
and so i found a company called 4chan in the world &apos;s office .
they have companies like the most powerful , and they helped , to discover these kinds of things .
if you could do it for the do , you could also help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me a little bit about how to be connected to your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who form my worldview .
tell me about this world .
and the world &apos;s : this world ? i think the world is the world , where you live -- how people around a cell , the friends , the family , the way you live , the way you live , the work , the way you live , the work , the way you live , the work and so .
all these things come and start from a place , and for me , and they start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing that you want to talk about .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is that the thought of the thoughts and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like strange things .
tell me about &quot; why &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
what is the most important thing ? what &apos;s the most important thing ?
why is it important , and what is the red ? what does the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little more about them , that &apos;s not you .
what else do you have through ?
... that doesn &apos;t have to be scared . what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
and no , no , thank you .
thank you for your patience .
yes . well . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be done .
there were very beautiful things .
the first thing i saw was that this idea was that their favorite two separate , but they have a little bit of the pages -- the morgan is a half a time of a brand .
the add to it very well .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with this .
and i think some companies are going to focus on a strength rather than both .
many companies tend to -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re afraid , they &apos;re afraid , they &apos;re afraid , and they &apos;re going to turn them to themselves , and they &apos;re actually turning it into something positive , and it &apos;s actually a little bit of a positive moving .
what other brands do ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , a target , wii , ambitious , floating from 24,000 , and the most powerful .
well , there are a little bit of brands and the brands , these things that come and go , but a more powerful , a brand , a very strong thing .
a more powerful brand , a brand , how is your brand ?
if someone would ask them to describe their own , their own , how would they be ?
you &apos;re a little bit of a computer ? are you something that &apos;s going to bring blood into the ground ?
or are you more likely to get a more powerful ?
are you something that &apos;s a little quiet , more conservative , conservative ?
and the things that are the things that are the insights , fresh like the most powerful , the most powerful , the most powerful , and the most powerful , and the other way to be the most powerful , agile and agile , and the agile , the magic , magical and the other way .
or are you more like a more powerful ?
are you ashamed and the most powerful like the most powerful ?
are they established , traditionally , more powerful , more compassionate , compassionate like oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , more secure , safe , excellent , and how the dalai lama or the dalai lama or the dalai lama ?
and in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies , the up and the &quot; no , &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they wanted to do nothing with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control about the finished product .
but it &apos;s going to be 17 , which were ready to get to these control , which wanted to make somebody so so so that they wanted to be able to tell them , and the error that we &apos;ve never been able to tell stories about , stories that would never support a computer system .
they &apos;re going to tell us the story of the computer &apos;s story , like we tell the story in this movie that you &apos;re using the brain today to be used to the brain , both to make the brain &apos;s brain , both to make advertising .
we went to sao paulo where the most powerful is banned .
in the entire city , since five years , no poster , no poster , no a rubber , nothing .
and we went in school , where companies are going to be able to get their way to the way in the world , in the united states .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most feedback or where i had the biggest success , those are where i &apos;m going to be with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
because they &apos;re the middle of the middle , they &apos;re the adoption , and they said that the agencies may not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artists directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and make something completely different , something that people think of , that our view is to think of it .
and how did it be ? what it &apos;s successful ?
well , because the movie in the nanoscale film festival had been in the world , we can look at this .
according to the first time , the first thing was in january , and since , and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million of the film that &apos;s the film .
that &apos;s actually a time of two one / two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no tv .
the film was not going to be able to get .
there &apos;s no even online . no one .
it &apos;s not in other countries .
now , finally , the film has been a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every ad that we talked about , their clients , who &apos;s going to be able to do the finger of it .
something i think is that if you &apos;re asking your chance to be able to make risks , you &apos;re going to be able to put risks in these risks .
i think if you keep people from it , you bring them closer to failure .
i think that if you &apos;re trained to avoid your employees , you &apos;re going to get the whole company prepared to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunities that you might be more likely to do .
finally , we should be welcome to the fear of fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
you &apos;re welcome to fear . hot you welcome the risk .
and a big taste of the , so we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , we get a little bit of honesty .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; you &apos;ve been welcome to transparency , &quot; you &apos;ve been singing by my good friends of the world &apos;s own friends , who paid $ the most powerful for the water .
big data will be transformed for organizations around the world in big opportunities .
and the so-called &quot; hot &quot; is welcome to transparency .
thank you .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , what &apos;s happening now with the $ the dollar ?
this is a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , and i was looking at the most popular of the most popular , the most popular -- a check in altitude , to fund my favorite year in the next year .
my name is a little bit of a time .
18 months ago , i did something else in google , and i &apos;m going to make something with museums and art . my favorite , which is also , gave me green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of the time , and stories , that can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the slide .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and your access to this slide .
i grew up in india .
i was a great education of a great education -- i &apos;m not going to be -- but i had no access to many museums and this artwork .
when i traveled , and to visit this museums , i started learning a lot of learning .
and while i worked for google , i tried to do this desire -- art available to the technology -- to lead to technology .
we &apos;re going to be a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m probably going to start with the demonstration , and you &apos;ll tell some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you &apos;re just going to get to the world .
you can look around in all these museums .
there &apos;s the most popular , moma , the moma , the most popular , the van gogh .
i even come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of kind in new york .
you &apos;re going to go in two ways -- very simple .
and the most powerful , and the most powerful , is you in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- suzanne , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and the auditory .
you want to get into the museum ?
open the map , and jump with a click .
in there they are , they want to end up to the end of the gangs .
just further . much fun .
they &apos;re going to go .
thank you , but the best thing is .
so i &apos;m a lot of my favorite , and i &apos;m a little bit of a little bit of a computer of the village &apos;s met .
i see this gluten .
if the museum gave us the picture , she click on it .
so this is one of the images .
this is all the non-zero-sum .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click away now .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve been doing with the so-called so-called the so-called .
this picture for example has about 10 billion of the world &apos;s year , i believe .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion of the time ? &quot;
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can very easily in and you can .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is a result .
but then you really want to be deep in .
and so i started playing on the street , and i realized there &apos;s something that &apos;s going on .
and i thought , &quot; wait , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and i realized that these kids actually beat something .
i was a little bit of a little bit , talking with some known at the met , and actually found that it &apos;s a game called a game called a football on the top of a stick .
it was pretty popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
and to go close to it , you can go to the ones .
just to give you the picture of the picture , i &apos;m looking at what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is , but in a second .
let &apos;s jump fast to moma , again in new york .
another more powerful of me , the most powerful .
at the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the brush ?
and what if you want to see van gogh &apos;s masterpiece , because it has created this masterpiece ?
you &apos;re in the way . you can actually go into it .
i &apos;m going to zoom in one of my favorite things , until i really &apos;m in the ones .
this is a little bit of a time , probably never before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there &apos;s a lot more , but i &apos;m missing the time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
everybody from them , every -- whether rich or poor , whether they have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and create your own museum -- all of these images can make you their own collection .
just , you &apos;re going to go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of the world &apos;s power -- you can get the power of the world .
this is the most powerful , in the most popular .
you can put everything with comments , send your friends , and so a conversation start about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , is the main thing that all the wonderful things are not coming from google .
they &apos;re going to be able to do my own way of the museums .
that should not be me .
they come from artists .
and that was a experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to be just going to be in the digital medium of art , and they represent it online .
and the biggest question is , the biggest question that i &apos;m going to do recently , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a computer system ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
so it &apos;s about . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be split in two camps .
this is the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , the intuitive side is .
if we had a scale to measure the most sophisticated every hemisphere , we could represent your brain .
for example , this is somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you be able to get your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have decided to have one of these extremes , but i think that for most people in the audience , their brain looks like this -- with a high high , very high , the same thing in both of the time .
it &apos;s not as if you &apos;re both exclusive or something like that .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i see myself as one of the people , together with most other experimental , which requires a good percentage of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good fraction of intuition to actually do the experiments .
how do we develop these intuition ? well , we love playing things .
so we go out and play and look like it &apos;s responding . and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that one thing can only be at a place .
i mean , it can sound strange about thinking that a thing is the same time at two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed them .
i remember seeing a child on a computer game on a computer company .
he was still a spectroscope and not very good at it and he fell constantly .
but i bet that it taught you to play a very valuable lesson , which is the big things you don &apos;t just leave , and that you &apos;re going to stay on a place .
and that &apos;s a great model of the world , so long they &apos;re not a more powerful .
it would be a terrible model for a computer , because they don &apos;t play with the play , but with these little strange particles .
and if you play with your particles , you all find kinds of strange things -- like you &apos;re going directly through walls , or that you can be at the same time in two different places .
and so they all wrote these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the physics of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little little particles .
but you didn &apos;t need to describe them around the great everyday objects around us .
that &apos;s not what my intuition didn &apos;t liked , and maybe because i don &apos;t have to play with particles .
well , i play sometimes with you , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical side is not liked .
because if all of the things are out of particles and all these particles that follow the rules of quantum mechanics , then not just the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that shouldn &apos;t be like that .
so i would feel better with the whole thing , if we could show that everyday people are also following the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a few years ago , and i was doing this .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see , which was in the most powerful .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
here i zoom on this . we &apos;re looking at this in the center .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal , like a meeting , and it &apos;s about the edge of the edge .
so i made this thing on similar ways to make a computer chip .
i went a clean space with new york , and i was a lot of a lot of time to do the big devices .
i had to build my own machine -- to build this like a swimming pool of hole and the thing to get .
this thing has the ability to be in the most powerful , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i &apos;m all doing all kinds of weird things , but then other people are going to get to all of these things , and i hear all these things because i don &apos;t want to do it , or , frankly , they said , &quot; they &apos;re not going to be . &quot;
so quantum mechanics says that the objects are feeling as well .
the fellow fellow for the objects are not only people , but it &apos;s also the light that seems to you and the wind that &apos;s going to be stuck on them and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is going to be a little bit of metal , we had to get out of all the time .
and then we did .
we &apos;ve turned the light off , put it into a vacuum and the whole air , and it &apos;s all the air , and it &apos;s almost to be in the elevator , and it was the piece of metal , the piece of metal , to behave like it was always .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it really moves strange .
instead of that it &apos;s just quiet there , it &apos;s a lot of time , and the way it was about this -- like this , like this -- like a little bit of a time , and together .
we gave him a little push , we could make it the same time to animate the same time , and not to animate something that is just in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what &apos;s really fantastic .
what does it mean to animate a object for the same time and not to animate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion of atoms are the piece of metal that &apos;s going to be a little bit of metal and the same time , and they move the same atoms and down .
just too precise voices , they &apos;re going to be .
the rest of the time are they &apos;re the most powerful .
that means that every atom is the same time at two different places , which is the whole piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
this was worth me for all this year in the clean space , because , you check that , the most powerful between a single atom and this piece of metal , about the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at two different places , this piece can be two different places , why not also do it ?
i mean , this is just what my logical side says .
so , imagine , you would be at the same time , like that ?
how would your consciousness deal with it that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we &apos;re doing it , the light is going to be the light and the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece of metal .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator in fact , just a little bit of the objects in the elevator , which are together in a small room .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more than it &apos;s more , it &apos;s more deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are . and that &apos;s the profound and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided that we should be able to think of the process of the process of economic development .
it should be our goal that when families think about where they &apos;re working and work , they have given them the possibility of the way to be full of a hand full of different cities that all of the people are in competition .
we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries that don &apos;t even have a single city to be able to be welcome to it .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much worth more value than it costs them .
so we could just be able to do the world with a very simple , maybe hundreds of new cities .
now , this may sound absurd for you , even though you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
but you just trade the building of apartments against the cities .
imagine that half people want to live in homes , did this already ; the other half but not yet .
they could try to expand the capacity of the existing apartments .
but you know what you would be able to do in these apartments and your environment , and your environment to avoid the difference and beyond the light .
so it turns out to be very difficult to keep out of all these kinds of the whole .
but you could go to a completely new place , a completely new block of building , and the laws would be able to support a building that , and not to be able to support it .
so i proposed that governments create new surfaces that provide enough space for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
later , i found that , about the same time , the same time , and the challenge of reform , have thought of a reform of reform in a hurry .
they knew that every year about azerbaijan , their country , to leave their country in the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same in the wild .
and in this place , the most powerful thing has said to the , &quot; what happens when we &apos;re going to get a surface of our country , what if we just have a message of the american message , a part of the canadian message , and if people want to go to the canadian rules , and they can do it in the surface of the world , and they can do it in the surface of the world , and they can do it in the surface of the world , and they can do it
in 2009 , in 2009 , a lot of the time was suffered under a severe design system .
the next thing to the next election elections won the caregiver , the language of a shift , which is a program , and also promised , as well as it promised .
he asked him to be a little bit of his favorite .
in the meantime , i was going to be on tedglobal .
through improvement , try and through the study of consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter city on the basic elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t have existing existing .
we pay new technologies , but for progress , it requires technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that are going to come to us .
in the fall 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk .
again , it showed him a little bit of a time .
the two calls me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december in december of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , to be a lot more valuable they &apos;re as they cost .
and i used this graph to show how valuable is a place like new york . think about it , that a surface in some cases is worth thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , in a place when there was a pause , and he said , &quot; paul , could we see the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk was in very simple form that a charter city is a place , which is the beginning of the country , a more powerful country , a computer that determines the laws that are going to be there , either under these rules , or not to be able to decide to be able to be able to decide , either under these rules or not .
so , i was asked by the president of the president of the senior , which meant that we need to do this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way that it is to bring our country .
i was asked to get to the fourth and the fourth and fifth january of january .
so i &apos;ve been given another one to facts , which is a graph like this , which is trying to illustrate that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city of the city , and the sketch is the new airport that was built in the nanoscale .
and this airport has a surface of 100 , a surface of 100 .
so i tried to convince the most powerful of this when you want to build a new city , you have to start with a field of at least 1,000 .
these are more than 250 thousand morning .
polite all the time .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
the head of congress came on the stage and said , &quot; professor , &quot; i thank you for your talk , but you might be able to look at the tedtalk .
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they &apos;ve played the tedtalk .
and i came to the line that a new city is the people who offers new possibilities .
there were the opportunity to live in a city that would be in a city , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city is also a new way of leaders with leaders .
the leaders of the government in the aid would depend on the help of the help , they could benefit from their own , they could benefit from their own , which would be the laws of the rule of the charter and the most inspiring thing that the charter is really going to be taken .
and the realization of president mcdonough was that the confidence of the total of the world i thought was a way to get the foreign investors to get the foreign investors and build this city for all the parties in a lot of the parties that are suffering for many years and mistrust .
we &apos;re in a field .
this picture is from this place .
it &apos;s easy to be a thousand miles .
and shortly after that , at the 19th of january , they voted at congress for a change of the constitution to have a more powerful , which is a special way to do that for special .
in a country that &apos;s just a huge crisis behind the process of congress , in congress , to a voice .
all parties , all the most sophisticated society , supported this .
and to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
at the 17th february , it was approved to be approved to a voice .
immediately after that choice , between the 21st and the 24 february , a neutron of about 30 , the two places in the world , who were most interested in the business of the world &apos;s business .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new urban center that built in south korea , and the urban mayor of the city of the city .
everything you can see on this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the sticky .
the other place that was very interested in urbanism is singapore .
it has been built two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re basically thinking about it , it &apos;s where we &apos;re today .
they already have a computer company ; they already consider this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already working on a legal system that the most powerful is allowed to participate , and it &apos;s working on a external system .
a country has been offered to put his top court , as a dish for the most popular calling of the system .
also , the most important and the most important thing is , very interested in .
they even bring funding with a .
one thing , as you know , has been already understood , there &apos;s a lot of the most powerful .
there are many companies who would like to be in america , especially in a place with a free , and there are many people who would love to live there .
on the world , there are 700 million people who say that they want to live on another place .
a million people leave the city in latin america , and they go into the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to get their families to get their families to make work sometimes , and they &apos;re a single mothers to make food , to eat and clothes .
unfortunately , it &apos;s sometimes kids who try to find their parents , which they &apos;re going to have , in some cases , since a decade , not seen anymore .
so what is it a idea to think about it in a very new city ?
or even more of these cities are distributed to build , or hundreds of the world ?
so what is it a idea to be a idea that every family has a choice between multiple cities that are in competition to be new residents ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends from a hurry asked me to say , thank you ted .
do you know how many choices do you do on a typical day ?
do you know how many choices do you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve been doing a survey about 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that are a typical american .
and also , a study was done with ceos , which they saw a week for a week .
and these scientists just documented the different themes with those ceo , and how much time they spent decisions to make decisions that are related to the topics .
and they found that a average ceo in the week is busy working with the most important tasks .
each of these topics was from many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
just for about 12 percent of their decisions , they needed an hour or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
you know how many choices do you meet in the nine minutes in the nine minutes in the one hour ?
how good do you think , are you to deal with the decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest most modern of our modern time , the most important thing .
i want to talk about the problem and over some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;ll ask you some questions and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise , because i &apos;m blind , just the hand , if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i &apos;m going to ask you if i &apos;m going to ask you a question , and your answer is , so , my first question for today is , are you ready to hear something about the most important ?
thank you .
when i was a little bit of a stanford at stanford university , i went to this very very very much store , at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was called the most popular .
this business , it was almost like a computer company .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and oil and over 500 different types of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different types of water -- and that was a time when we actually drink the time .
i loved this business to go to this business ; but i asked myself , well , how do you never get a little buy ?
here &apos;s the olive gang .
they had over 75 different kinds of oil oil , including that were embedded in boxes that were locked from a thousand years old .
so i decided to visit the leader , and i asked the ladder , &quot; works this model , that you really offer the people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up the most popular of tourists that came every day and usually their cameras had their cameras .
we decided to do a experiment and we chose to be a experiment for our experiment .
here &apos;s her body gang .
they had a different species of the different species of the world .
we set up a little bit of a little bit of the entrance on the entrance of business .
we have six different tastes there , or 24 different tastes , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i &apos;ve looked at two things , first , i &apos;m going to be able to stay more people and try to get out of it ?
it &apos;s more people , if it was 24 , about 60 percent , when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we saw that in which case the people were going to be able to be able to be able to get a glass of the people .
now we saw the opposite effect .
and the people who were left when they were 24 , just bought three percent of the glass .
and the people who were left as it was six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of them .
now , if you calculate it , people bought six times more than a glass of the water that they had six to the choice when they had 24 to choice .
now , to decide not to buy glass , probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the most important thing is that the most important decisions are influenced by us .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it &apos;s about our own best interests .
so the issue of the day : financial communication .
i &apos;m going to describe you now a study that i &apos;m going to do with a design of the world , and i was doing a study of the world , and i was doing the decisions of the food , which we were doing to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
and what we looked at was whether the number of the most powerful , which was a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a bit of a time that &apos;s going to be influenced by the probability of the way that it &apos;s saved for tomorrow .
and we found that there was actually a context .
so in these plans , we had about the other of the plans that people were doing something between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund were offered that , in fact , the participation was smaller .
now , if you look at the extreme look , the plans that were offered two fund , a more powerful in the 1970s -- still not so high as we want to .
in the plans that almost 60 fund , the most common , the most common thing is about the most violent percent .
now , it turns out that even if you &apos;re going to participate , if you were going to participate , if you were more possibilities to the choice , even it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate , more than that , the more possibilities they were available to them , the more they were going to pick up and supporting them .
the more possibilities to you were available , the more you put your whole money in pure .
no one of these extreme decisions , belongs to the decisions that someone would recommend from people if we &apos;re important to their future financial well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three crucial negative consequences that provide that from more and more choices with themselves .
they &apos;re going to make the decision -- they &apos;re going to go , even if it &apos;s about their own best interest .
they &apos;re more worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to be able to make themselves less happy , even if they make it objective .
the main reason that we might enjoy it is that maybe we enjoy these huge shelves full of the big shelves of the water , mustard , oil and the most powerful , but we can &apos;t actually make the comparison and the limitations of the fantastic supply .
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested on different ways , and they &apos;re just tested in their business -- they can just apply in their business .
first , just just .
they &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today that less than that .
people are always worried when i say , &quot; just &quot; just . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing the most powerful .
but in fact , we see it more and more , that if you &apos;re ready to be willing to be too easy , and the mere kind of opportunities will be , now there &apos;s a rise of sales , and there &apos;s a improvement of the brain &apos;s cost , &amp; amp ; it &apos;s a improvement of the brain .
as a computer , and the different head of the other head and the other head of 26 to 15 , they &apos;ve been reduced to a rise of sales for 10 percent .
when the golden corporation was sold to the worst , the most famous , they sold the worst , they experienced that the profit to the intangible percent of the sales , a result of the sales and reducing the cost of the cost of the cost .
you know , the average of the average , you can do a cartoonist of products .
a typical wal-mart offers you today today .
but the most popular supermarket , the world &apos;s office , is the world &apos;s office , and they just give them 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in doses .
now in the world of the world , i think one of the best examples that recently came on the market , as you &apos;re best , is something that david was very strong , and it &apos;s a program that &apos;s going to be offered to be a program that &apos;s going to be offered at harvard .
every single harvard employees now take a part of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of time .
those who want to make a choice , will be offered 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to do it .
it &apos;s all important ways . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the staff is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities of each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t get them , it can &apos;t be your clients . &quot;
now before we started to lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be ready to offer all people in this audience a holiday in the world &apos;s most beautiful street of the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read you the way .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read them and then i &apos;m going to clap them , if they &apos;re ready to take the offer of the service .
okay . everybody &apos;s ready is to take a skill .
are that all ?
well , let me show you something more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who is ready for this journey .
i think i might have heard more hands .
good .
the fact that you look at is the first time , the first time , more information , when the second time , but i would think it &apos;s the second time that they felt real time .
because the images had to feel real for them .
what brings me to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of the world &apos;s problem , it &apos;s the most powerful .
it &apos;s about understanding people to understand the difference between possibilities , understanding what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that consequences have to be vivid and specific .
why are people going to be 15 to 30 percent more , if they use a card card or a card card , as a card card , as a car card ?
because it doesn &apos;t feel true .
and it turns out that if you make it , something feels specific , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people to save more .
so we &apos;ve been in a study that i did with a design of the world , and we &apos;ve made a study with the people in the world , and we &apos;ve done a study with people in the world -- employees , who were working on the most important one in the way they signed their participation for their own .
and as this meeting , we &apos;ve got this meeting just like you &apos;ve always been , just have a little bit of a little bit .
the little thing we have is that we &apos;ve asked people to think of the people just all the positive things that would happen in their lives when they were saving money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation to 20 percent and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or a rise to four percent of the amount that they were willing to pay for the most powerful .
the third technology : the third technology .
we can better deal with more categories than with more choices .
here &apos;s for example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a computer system .
it turns out that it &apos;s in the world &apos;s business , and down in the northeast area , the number between the other species of magazines to high species has been up to the way of magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines , and you &apos;re going to be in 10 categories , or i &apos;m going to show you 400 magazines , and that in 20 categories , you think i &apos;ve given you more choices and a better time , when i gave you the $ the 600 .
because the categories tell me how i can hold them apart .
here are two different types of things .
one is called jazz , and the other is called &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jazz &quot; .
if you think that the left display is the left , and the ad on the right jazz is , then they clap in the hands .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
if you think that the on the left is jazz , and the right side is , you &apos;re clapping , please clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out that they &apos;re right .
the left side is jazz and the right is the right thing , but you know what ?
this is a very high kind of a lot of a sudden .
the categories have to say something the most important thing to do , not the choice of the choice .
and this problem you often see when you look at the long lists of all of these fund .
who are you going to do it ?
my fourth technology : premise for complexity .
it turns out we can actually deal with more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to increase the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german dragline , which gives you the opportunity to make your car completely .
they have to make 62 different decisions to make their car completely .
now these decisions are different in the number of choices that they offer a decision .
and the car &apos;s car , the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , the scores -- four possibilities .
what i &apos;m doing now is , i change the order of the decisions .
half of the customers is going to be about the many possibilities , 56 , 56 , four folds .
the other half of the customers is about the low possibilities , four folds , to the 56 , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
as they are .
if you use the most powerful in the decision , it &apos;s going to be overwhelmed , that you &apos;re going to be overwhelmed with the most expensive , i &apos;m losing you .
what you find is that people who go from the many to the low , and they &apos;re always going to choose the most powerful .
we lose them .
go from the little choices to the many , then you stay .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i did is change the order of changing this information in this information .
when i start with the simple , i &apos;m learning how i &apos;m going to go .
even though the test is choosing , i don &apos;t tell myself about my preferences in the interior , it &apos;s still going to pick me up .
it also makes me excitement about the big product that i &apos;m going to do , and i &apos;m ready to be able to be able to be interested in interest with interest .
let me summarize .
i told you about four techniques that the problem of the world &apos;s problem -- just -- you &apos;ll get the symphony alternatives ; you &apos;re going to do it , and you can do it , and you can do it , and you can do better , and you can do better with more categories .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe today is to help you manage the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for people who are offer service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re in the selection .
and the more we &apos;re choosing the better , the better we &apos;re going to be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin &apos;s , and i &apos;m kevin , and i &apos;m looking at youtube .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are going to be distributed , and then , why that &apos;s what it &apos;s important at all .
we all want to be stars -- the glory , singer , singer -- when i was young , it seemed like that , that &apos;s infinitely difficult .
but the most important thing is that we can be very famous , and all of our creative activities can be famous in a part of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to the next saturday .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours of video is uploaded a minute .
and again , just a tiny percentage of it will ever be a tiny percentage and it &apos;s going to look at thousands of times and so on .
so how does this work ?
three things : the most unexpected , and the unexpected .
well , we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
whoa !
and the most powerful , the .
last year , the video of this video was filmed by this video he filmed in the high national park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this chart shows how it looked at the video last summer , the first time .
actually , no viral video wanted to do a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing that , if you &apos;re going to be a mile mountain mountain .
he had uploaded a lot of the amount of water .
and this video was actually sent in january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jimmy , jimmy .
jimmy &apos;s singing the tweet , the video that was made last day .
because the way jimmy is like jimmy , and the interesting things , and they show us a big audience and show them a big audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday . the way it &apos;s going down on friday is the square , and it &apos;s going to be the most powerful , and it &apos;s a little bit of the time to be the most important , friday , friday .
rs are &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was almost 200 million times .
so the graph looked like this .
just like &quot; double &quot; seems to be the nothing that &apos;s coming out of nothing .
what happened to this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also the other peaks .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , the most powerful thing to do is , many blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson nelson was a first one that was a chance to do that in twitter .
and it &apos;s important that a person or group of the world &apos;s disease took a point of a point , with a big audience , and that &apos;s accelerating the process .
then this community was formed by people who shared this big joke , and started talking about it and to play with it .
now there are 10,000 of the &quot; friday &quot; at youtube .
in the first seven days , there was a supermassive for every single day .
unlike the most popular conversation of the 20th century , participation is the community of the community to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or something new from it .
&quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; is animation and music in the world .
this is , just .
this year it was almost 50 million times .
and if you hold that for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a more powerful one that was seen four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats that look at this video .
and it &apos;s important to creativity that &apos;s in the most violent of the world &apos;s office and the geeks .
there were the u.s.
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole kind of a whole set of the ground that made it from a stupid joke to something that we can all participate on .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure to something , we &apos;re doing it .
who could have been able to prioritize this ?
who would have been &quot; double &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do you have to write in the way that you can write that in the way that you can do that ?
in a world , in the one minute , two days video , just really unique and unexpected , as the mentioned of videos .
i &apos;m not going to give you a very much interested in me when i said a friend , i should be looking at this great video , about a guy who was in new york against 15,000 bicycles .
i got a ticket because i &apos;m not on the most popular , but often there are disabilities that are not going to go to the most beautiful .
and it &apos;s completely surprising and satisfying , was casey &apos;s idea , and his argument was looking at five million times .
this approach is true for everything we do creative .
and that &apos;s all that leads us to a big question ...
what does that mean ?
and the most powerful .
what does that mean ?
and the creative , creative , very unexpected , is the features of a new kind of media and culture , and the most popular thing that we have in the audience is determined to be in the audience .
as i said , one of the currently stars -- justin crick -- was made his beginning at youtube .
nobody has to give your ideas green light .
and today we &apos;re all feeling as owners of our culture culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media and they &apos;re not going to meet the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the connectedness between women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of these connectedness in the lives of a four year-old girls , when they were about 30 years ago , and they were talking about 30 days ago , and they were talking about the little girl , and they were talking about the other girl , and they were talking about the other girl , and they were talking about the other girl , and they were talking about it .
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that will put together .
i want to tell you about some of the most sophisticated .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life of the simple hope of unity and freedom was combined by his home .
hold it on the top of the airstream in the face of the airstream , like he must be saying that his life had been a single waste .
the words , so long his friends , now , his friends , now .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgotten me to be forgotten .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to justify us , but we &apos;re going to be able to get it out .
the next piece shows how a boat in the early world &apos;s early is quiet on sea .
my mother may be 18 , when her father died -- in a computer marriage , in a computer marriage , with two little girls .
for you , life had asked her a task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely scary that they could fail .
after a four year-old and a little bit of a boat , a boat is silent on the lake , as a , as a , as a , as a , as a , as a , as a , as a , the ocean .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear of the pirate , rape and death .
as most adults on the boat , my mother wore a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
in a computer of a computer , just my sister and i , then she &apos;s going to drink and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the constant of the engine , the clapping of every wave on the bug , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates , which came to a lot of times , but from the most popular of the men on our boat , or the sun &apos;s motor , the six hours of the engine , the six hours .
but i remember the lights of the world &apos;s lights , and the young man , who broke and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first , the first one of the first time .
no apple ever repeated again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in baltimore .
and the next thing is , from four women in three generations , that build a new life together .
we were going down in the street , one of the university of the class of the world &apos;s population , whose population is from the world &apos;s population .
unlike the most powerful , their existence , they were completely unknown to me , there was no more powerful .
the smell of the world came from the rest of the world .
and the most broken broken system were made between people who had one thing together : they started new .
my mother worked on farms , then at a line of a line in a field of a day , six days , twice layers .
it kind of been to find the time , english and the children who were going to be taught .
we were poor .
every dollar was given and was put in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to get to that . most of the time , the new things came out of the day .
two of these are two of the things that school , every one to cover the holes in the other .
a more powerful to the most powerful , because they had to get six years .
and there were the rare but painful of &quot; the &quot; and there and there and there &apos;s a lot of the time , &quot; the asian , goes home . &quot;
after home , where ?
something more powerful in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a calm voice , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted , but we told each other from our day , and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered on the boat of the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake , to stay awake until her nightmares came to her , so i could wake them up .
she opened a computer , then a computer company , and then a business was going to be a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t change change , angry and the children , and the children , caught between two worlds .
loans and donors were looking at .
centers were built .
i lived in a lot of time .
in one of the classical asian students , the classic asian student , the most popular demands of themselves .
in the other , i was in insecure life , the tragic scars of violence , the most popular and the tunisian .
but so many of the years of help .
and because of this aid , i was in my last year of the year of the year as a boy &apos;s year .
and i was going to be a more of a computer , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous , of the most powerful , was tan le , refugee and social activist , who was invited to talk to places that were never heard , and in homes whose existence would never have imagined .
i didn &apos;t know with the limbic .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the most powerful .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the comfort of life of a unknown , a grandmother , a mother , a mother and two daughters who were so desperate to be so busy for 20 years , by telling each other to be the stories of their day and they were still in the same bed .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old as you had , as we had the boat .
no one was never a way .
&quot; do it just &quot; do you say . &quot; and it &apos;s not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about the most important and education , and the prejudice of the world &apos;s and the more powerful and the more .
and the open i spoke to the more , the more i should tell you .
i met people in all the time , so many of them did what they loved , lived in the limits of the possible .
and even though i had my degree , i realized i couldn &apos;t be able to get a career in law .
there had to be another thing .
and i realized that it &apos;s okay to be a snob , a a bit of a , new , new , new , and not just , but not just , but something you need to be grateful to be a gift of the brain .
because the way that we can lead to the collapse of the bloodstream can lead that , so easily means that you &apos;re accepted the assumptions of the environment .
i went to the now of my favorite , and i went to know that , yes , the world , but not as you &apos;re going to get it .
possibilities that didn &apos;t have been allowed to be manipulated .
there was a energy , a more strict optimism , a strange soup of humility and the most powerful .
so i followed my gut gut .
i collected a little team of people to go to the box , &quot; not a &quot; a challenge . &quot;
a year , we didn &apos;t have a cent .
at the end of a single venture , i cook a huge amount of soup that we shared .
we worked late in the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant , and we managed to do the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull the united states .
after just one journey there .
my gut gut .
three months later , i moved and the adventure went on .
before i leave the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up to a time in the world &apos;s social norm , the social norm and the local people who were the most important person .
life has not changed since centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother moved her alone .
with 17 , she was the second woman of a school , whose mother suggested her .
without support of your husband , she was worried for a big , by brought it into the court , and she was a more powerful , and a bigger big , as you won .
&quot; don &apos;t &quot; come out as a result .
i just put a mountain in a hotel hotel in sydney when she died . 1,000 miles away in baltimore .
i looked through the most popular and looked at it on the other side .
i knew she was coming to go to the following .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in a buddhist temple and sat around her fingertips .
we told her stories and the sensitivity that we were still at her .
to midnight , the monk came and said he had to close the craft .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of your own ? &quot;
&quot; because they &apos;ve been holding them for the morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you don &apos;t left them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s going through the women .
you see who we were and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men who have had been in our lives , we would have been in the way that we were in the way .
the defeat would have been easy .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i think that &apos;s the boat .
who would ever be a wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , ease , before the , before .
can i give you a bug in your life , which is courageous every wave , the most courageous , the engine , the vast horizon , the vast horizon , which doesn &apos;t have any ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and you could make it safe , i would do it .
and also , the ted mother is here today in the fourth or fifth series .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it at all photography ?
because that &apos;s one picture that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
but my interest started to do photography when i got my first digital digital , age of 15 years .
i put it with my former preference for drawing , but it was a little different , because the camera was actually in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends , if you press on the trigger .
so for me , it seemed to be more about photography , and to be the right place to be right time .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that starts to start when the trigger is going to be shut .
photos like this : a construction block along a much more sophisticated road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and the more realistic level .
or photographs like this -- dark and the same thing , but all of the common goal , to keep a realistic level .
if i say reality , i &apos;m going to be a lot of time .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can actually capture , but i want to look at it as if you could have that , on a photograph .
photos where you have to think a short moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about capture a idea , as really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what does the illusion create ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but then , in the last time , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how they can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what realistic is , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see it as a puzzle of reality where you take different pieces and put together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect , and we &apos;ve been able to identify the physical objects that we can identify in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , they can create something that looks still a three-dimensional , as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so we &apos;re upset our brains , because our brain is not really going to be able to do it .
and i see the same process in combine photographs .
it &apos;s really about connecting different realities .
so the things that look like a picture of realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things that we &apos;re doing in our lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise you just see wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to pursue a realistic outcome .
as you can see , it &apos;s not three special images .
but combine something special , and you can create something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
second , combined photos have the same thing .
and these two images are going to meet these two demands -- from the same altitude , and the same thing .
third , it &apos;s impossible to do it , to make it impossible where the individual images start and end by them .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photo was actually put together .
so by putting color , contrast and the edges of the edges , the individual images , pays up , as a , , as a single , , , , as a single photograph , and the disorders , we can take the boundaries between the different images and let them look like a single photograph , even hundreds of levels of levels , and let &apos;s look like a single photograph , even hundreds of levels of levels , and let &apos;s look like a single photograph , even hundreds of levels of levels , and let &apos;s
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that it &apos;s just a landscape , and the bottom part of it was manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely put together , from photos of different places .
i personally think it &apos;s easier to create a place , to find a place , because you don &apos;t have to go to a compromise with the ideas in its head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew i needed several months to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on a computer company .
the bank comes from another place .
the most popular thing comes from a quarry .
and yes , i even have the house up on the island of red , to look at it .
so to reach a realistic outcome , it &apos;s going out from me to planning .
i always start with a act of an act .
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s a very good plan .
and then if you make good images , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
so , it &apos;s all the tools there , and the only thing that we &apos;re doing is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic people are failing .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we &apos;ve introduced to the most popular , was a more powerful one .
it &apos;s not particularly scientifically -- it &apos;s a cup of coffee , or tea , and the patients , families , relatives , shared , &quot; how does it go ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all of the electronic people -- maybe most of the electronic people are failing : because we stopped listening .
this is my favorite thing . a very simple thing .
she has a button , on / .
and every morning i jump to this .
and yes , i have a job , as you might recognize .
i &apos;ve been doing my job in 95 pounds .
it &apos;s just working : every time i go to the scale , they send my data to google health .
and there are also a lot of my favorite flight of my favorite , so he can see where my favorite is , and it &apos;s not just in the moment that i &apos;m going to support or something that i need to do with a look at the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with that , i have about 4,000 of the people &apos;s most important .
so every morning i go to my favorite and people talk to me before i sit in the car : &quot; lunch rather , just a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a car , &quot; lunch . &quot;
but this is the most important thing that can happen because this is the pressure pressure , pressure , to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could be the patient smoking .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and to bring them together , to play some kind of game to control their health better .
and the next week comes to the market .
it will give you this little bit of the time that you &apos;re going to be on a iphone or so forth .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure , to send them to their doctor and share it for other people , for something more than 100 dollars .
in this point , patients come into play . they can &apos;t just take control , captain on their own ship , but can also help us in health care , and they can help the challenges of the health , twice demand , and so on .
do it , the way that they &apos;re easy to use and start to hug patients in the team .
and that can reach through these kinds of ways , but also through a lifelong .
and one of the things we did is i want to share with you with a quick video .
we all have the most sophisticated in our cars .
maybe in our mobile phones .
we know exactly where all the machines are around the world &apos;s own .
we know one where all the stations are .
and clear , we can find the world &apos;s .
but where would the next thing to help the patient ?
we have a lot of time , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next life-saving was going to find the next one in this moment .
so , what did we do ? we &apos;ve done a hurry in the netherlands .
we &apos;ve built a website , and a crowd asked , &quot; if you see a little bit of a computer , please share , you share where he &apos;s on , &quot; because sometimes it &apos;s closed , of course , &quot; because sometimes it &apos;s closed as a little bit of a time , of course .
and over 10,000 , in the netherlands , in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
and we &apos;ve created a more powerful thing .
we &apos;ve developed an app for the most violent , distributed reality to find these kinds of things .
and if you &apos;re in a city like a city , and someone is going to be able to use your iphone , you can use your iphone , and you also get your iphone to find the next couple of things that save life .
and we don &apos;t want to just do this as a computer designer , as the product is called , but also as a computer designer .
and we want to bring this to a worldwide level .
and we ask our colleagues all around the world , from other universities , to help us help how to behave like the behavior of the world to pass this kind of world on the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation , and somebody &apos;s going to be a little bit of a bit of a little bit of your own , or somebody else , you can find a little bit of a more powerful .
the other thing we want to ask is that companies are going to help us all over the world in the world .
these could be the ones that could be , or technicians for example , just to ensure that the most important thing is , the most important thing is that the most important thing is to be in its place .
please help us and try and try to improve health , but to take the hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to tell you about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the most violent .
and my little little bit of the time , we want to force ourselves to make ...
... it &apos;s going to be given attention to the timeline .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may be , until it &apos;s been done .
now -- we can just skip this -- i &apos;m just going to skip the video ...
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
and the most powerful thing is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year , to take a year and work in a environment that is so much all of what they hate , we have to work in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the most important for the u.s.
we choose some fellows , and we &apos;re going to work with a lot of clips .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them into the world .
and there they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what you really do is to show what &apos;s possible today .
so they meet al .
al is a computer in boston .
here it looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he really looks like is someone who &apos;s going to be a little bit of it , if he &apos;s a little bit of a meter , because he knows he &apos;s not very good in the most important of the world when he &apos;s from a meter of snow .
how did he get to search on this particular kind of way ?
we had a team of fellows in boston in boston , which is the code for america .
they were in february , and it has a lot of the time in february .
and they realized that the city never is free to get this fire fire .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik , was still a little different and that was that the residents were free to make the sidewalks free , right before these parts .
so he did what everybody would do , he wrote a app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt fire fire .
you &apos;re going to get to the top of it , if it &apos;s going .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game game .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that have written the fellows in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other .
they &apos;re spreading out .
there &apos;s this guy in the world &apos;s city , which has seen the city that he could use this app , not for snow , but , so that the citizens are taking out .
it &apos;s very important that these are the most important things that are working , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to clean the u.s.
and chicago has just introduced them to the people who are the most powerful , when it &apos;s going .
we now know nine cities , the plan to use this app .
and she &apos;s got a lot of organic , organic , of course .
if you know something about the more of the time , you know that it &apos;s usually not going to go .
the mental power of software takes a few years .
we had a team that was working last year in boston , for three people , for three people .
it was a way to figure out the parents , which are the right public schools for their children .
and we &apos;ve been told that when it would go over the normal channels , it would have taken over two years and had taken it over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not yet .
there &apos;s a project in the california law , which has cost the maximum , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then spread from the very , kind of shot , is a kind of shot of the the world &apos;s institution .
it shows how the government could work better -- not like a private company , like many people think they should .
and not even like a computer system , but more like the internet itself .
and that means free access to that means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , it &apos;s a new generation , which is the problem of government , which is the problem of government -- not as the problem of a computer institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good in collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to make things effectively together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; there &apos;s hundreds of people all over the country , which are coming up and write , every day in their own communities .
they don &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re dreadful with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they &apos;re not going to fix them .
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s what you &apos;re all going to do , if you all have your feelings about politics and the snake , and all the other things that we really missed is government , in the core of tim o , &quot; what we &apos;re doing is not alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people have given the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re going to change it because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government ended up their power -- they &apos;re going to be , &quot; we the people ? &quot; -- how we think about this , is going to affect how this change happens .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and as many people , i thought it &apos;s mostly about choosing people in a office .
now , after two years , i came to the conclusion that it &apos;s especially in communities to go to the community .
this is the call for service and information .
you usually come out , if you &apos;re in your city , you know , if you &apos;re in your city .
if you ever have the chance to work in your urban call , how our fellow scott scott was a part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re doing all -- you can see that people , you can see that people who are the government , including the government because of many different problems , including that the government is going to call the government because of many different problems , including that the government is going to be the government because of many different problems , including that the government is going to be the government
so scott gets this kind of thing .
he &apos;s called &quot; the official database &quot; in the official database .
and he didn &apos;t really have a idea . he starts with the most important .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open up the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock is going to be ? &quot;
and that worked . round of scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the most popular .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call .
it has an app , a more powerful and a more powerful , called &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work very clever people in the office of the new urban , &quot; in boston . &quot;
one day -- this is a real report -- it came in : &quot; the &quot; in my remote remote system , can &apos;t say if you &apos;re dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens with &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
scott was going to be human being .
but on &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; that everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post we have was , &quot; i went over there , found the remote production of the house .
and , yes ? yes . alive ?
turned the remote to the side . went home .
good night , cute , sweet . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . this is the digital digital system .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how government is in the stadium .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i &apos;m not necessarily going to do a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m going to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role .
they connected these two people .
and you could have connect them with government performance , if that needs , but a neighbor is a very much better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if a neighbor helps the other , we &apos;re going to make our communities .
let &apos;s call the most powerful , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about that , is that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is choose .
how often do we have chosen a political leader -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we &apos;re going to be able to get back and we expect the government , and we don &apos;t have a lot of changed ?
that &apos;s because the government is a further ocean , and politics is the top of the top .
and what &apos;s under , is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s these contempt that we have , and we pay to pay something that is working against us , something else , and then we &apos;re going to be ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want that this institution to us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the actual thing is happening .
we need to be able to get to the sun of government .
so the most important thing has done .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of a way of a very detailed report that wrote a very detailed report , which is a answer to the most powerful to the most powerful .
that &apos;s not a political active , which is active .
well , for those of us who have given the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to imagine the enormous challenges you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we have to achieve what we need to do without improving the institution , which can be in the name of us all ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but the more efficient thing is to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of government is fundamentally going to be able to do something by doing the society in a way that you can actually get the society .
and there is a generation that grew up the internet , and that knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the only systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of them .
this is a generation that grew up with it , your voice as granted .
they &apos;re not fighting this fight that we all fight , that &apos;s how to talk about who can talk ; they all talk .
you can make your opinion , every channel to every time , and you do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that are improving the work of government .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
that could be a fire fire , and it could be a fire , a trash effect with a more powerful turn .
and sure , we would have these fire fire that can be the whole time , and many people do that .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers of government , and we &apos;re not just giving the government to pay and overcome performance .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all been here for you : if it &apos;s about the big , important things that we need to do together , all together , we &apos;re going to be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually my role is to explain the people like wonderful technologies , which are on the emergence of the emergence , and i thought , because i &apos;m here under friends , i would tell you what i really think is .
i &apos;m going to start to show you a single boring slide .
... you could see the slide .
this is a slide that i &apos;ve chosen from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but in fact , the general form .
this slide shows data of a analysis of us about the performance of the performance of the information of the field of networks .
the interesting one here is that this slide , like a few other , which we often find in our field , is a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a place .
with other words , every step here is a power in the world &apos;s office .
and that &apos;s an multinational that we need to use this guy in the field of technology in the field of technology .
something very strange is happening here .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the light back .
something more powerful because i &apos;m going to draw something on paper here .
now why do we draw graphics in the technology on the technology of the technology ?
the reason that i would draw it on a normal curve , where , say , this is the years , so the timeline of a kind , and this is a kind of a kind of a place that i want to show with a graph , which i want to show with a graph , then the graph is silly .
so , you see that .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , we &apos;ll say a more powerful , then it would be very irrational to the scale of the scale , in form of a flat line .
but if something happens here , it changes the world &apos;s conditions .
so when the most fast progression of the world &apos;s development would be as fast as the most fast progression , we could get a taxi in a taxi and we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
there was never before in the history of the world &apos;s history , this kind of kind of a plastic growth , which is the scale of all the few years .
so the question i want to ask you is if you look at this exponential curves , you &apos;re not going to go to it forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is going to be so fast and forever .
there are two ways .
either it &apos;s going to be a classic of the classic , and it &apos;s going to be a new way of coming up , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
this is in about .
well , i &apos;m a optimist , so i think something like this is going to happen .
it &apos;s really like that , then that &apos;s what we &apos;re in right now in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition of the world , in a new way of the world .
so the question i want to ask and i often have to be a place , is that the new world will be ?
what is this new state that is slow around the world ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing to be if you &apos;re in the middle .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 , and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future and they found that the future still is in 2000 .
and we &apos;re not going to go to that .
so in other words , the future is taken every year to a year for me .
i think the reason that we realize that it &apos;s something in the way that it &apos;s happening .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we know that it &apos;s just not a sense of trying to try to see 30 or 50 years in the future because everything is going to be so different that a simple place of what we &apos;re doing now is not a sense of what we &apos;re doing now .
so i want to talk about what that might be , that transition in the world we &apos;re right now .
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really don &apos;t have any of the technology or computers .
because i think that really can understand that , we have to go back to a step and look at the thing on a longer .
and i want to look at this on the limbic of the world &apos;s life .
i think this is what makes sense of sense , if you split it in some of the things .
so let &apos;s go back , and it &apos;s 2.5 billion years , the earth was a big , more powerful , a lot of the chemicals that are floating with a lot of it .
now , if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized , then we have a pretty good picture about how they &apos;re the most good thing to do .
i also believe there are theories that start to understand how everything started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about that time that that &apos;s little oil of the world &apos;s disease that has been brought into the same way of chemicals .
some of these oil spills contain a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from outside and growing .
all of these were , started to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able .
these little oil oil were the most primitive of the most primitive .
but these oil spills weren &apos;t about alive in today , because every single one was just a small , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
and every time it shared , the ones that have been distributed to the more sophisticated amounts of chemicals .
so every calorie was a little different .
in fact , the footprints grew up , which had a for the growth of the growth of the composition of the composition of the other and integrated more and more chemicals from outside and shared .
so these tend to survive longer and it &apos;s going to be in the field of the field .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting it will be if these micro-machines learned a trick about abstraction .
in any way that we don &apos;t really understand that , these micro-machines have learned the ability to make information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and that &apos;s a certain chemical form that we call dna .
and with other words , they have found in this kind of field , evolutionary species , which allowed you to do what they were allowed to do , so that this information was stored and copied .
the amazing thing about that is that this kind of information is about the time of 2.5 billion years , in which she was born , right .
in fact , the recipe is for us , which is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same notation .
and that &apos;s the exact thing that &apos;s used exactly the same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re as far as we can , just to be writing , even in this code .
and i have 100 of the white of a white , which i &apos;m going to keep out of the airports from the world &apos;s .
in it , what i &apos;ve done is , i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is made from normal letters , which we use to the process -- and i &apos;ve written my business business on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve written 10 ^ 22 times .
so if somebody wants to do a hundred million copies of my business business , i have enough for everyone in this room and even for everyone on this world , and it &apos;s exactly here .
i &apos;d have a really a more powerful thing , and then i had written them on a virus , and in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna of dna was an interesting step .
and the most powerful these cells -- it made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and that &apos;s what they started to communicate , and to communicate information , and that communities were made of cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
this is the reason why the caucasus grows to antibiotics .
some bacteria have found , how they can stay from penicillin and have this information together with other bacteria in the dna and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate with each other .
now these communication allowed the reasons to be in a sense of communities , which were in a sense of the same boat ; they were a lot of the time .
so they either survived together , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all individuals were more likely to repeat , and from evolution .
the most important thing is , where these communities are so close to the same , they decided they decided to write the recipe for the whole community in a world .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
and at that point , we have the communities , communities of many of the most powerful , which is changing as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a kind of a brain company .
we have a lot of cells that are not asked to be in itself .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started to develop that the level , which is the evolution that evolution was not the individual cell , but the whole thing that we call organism .
the next step is now in this communities .
the most important thing began to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures , which didn &apos;t make any other thing as information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the most powerful , which is built these kinds of things that have built these kinds of things .
they started to train specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and that &apos;s what information is .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
and there was a evolutionary advantage .
because at that point , a individual -- learning now happened within the time of the life of a single organism , rather than this evolutionary time .
so a organism could learn to learn a certain pollen , because they didn &apos;t liked bad and made it sick , the last time he had eaten them .
so this was what happened within the lifespan of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years , because these information had to be found by the individuals , which died because of these industries , which died because of these industries , they didn &apos;t get there .
so the nervous system has the most powerful thing to do with this particular kind of thing , because evolution could now be within a individual way .
she could be in a time of time .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
so , as an example , the most famous version of this is the human language , the human language .
it &apos;s a fairly amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , very complicated , and elegance of my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically going to be in the way that i &apos;m going to be able to create a kind of confused idea in your head , which has a certain resemblance with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , it &apos;s going to turn into sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of other .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we , the humanity , is we started abstract .
we go through the same stages , which is the most important thing -- the abstraction of our methods , how we hold data , present .
the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
and the computer , computers , the , the way , and so on , all of our dictators , that we &apos;ve built in our community , to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also can be able to develop faster than we were .
so today evolution can happen in the time of microseconds .
you &apos;ve seen a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of evolution where it showed a little evolution in the &quot; the &quot; program &quot; in the &quot; program . &quot;
so we have the most powerful again .
the first steps of history , which i told you , was a billion years a piece of years .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , made some hundred million years .
then the more important steps , like language and so on , would be less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to take a few decades .
the process is feeding itself from itself and it &apos;s going to be , i think , the word is the word -- if something is going to be more likely to be more likely .
the more it changes , the faster changes it .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explosion of the curve .
we see the process that feed itself from itself .
i live in a living of computers and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism that i use to build computers , not using the computer , not using progress in computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design this in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is doing in the most violent .
it has billions of things .
what i do instead , and what the designers are doing is , we think , we think about a certain kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a machine , and the machine is doing something that makes our skills far more , better and faster than we could ever do it .
and it &apos;s partly doing it with methods that we don &apos;t even understand until now .
a method which is particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been using in the last time is the evolution itself .
we install a computer in the machine , which is what &apos;s going on in the world &apos;s office .
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program which is developed from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , &quot; please , a hundred million randomly randomly , and we &apos;re going to be a hundred million randomly .
now , all of these randomly are going to be elected instructions , all of the programs , and then they &apos;re going to pick the ones that are my own , and they &apos;re going to choose the next thing to do . &quot;
so in other words , i &apos;ll define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to be a little bit of numbers that would be a simple example of that .
so , the programs that can be sort of kind of a number of numbers .
of course , the chance of being elected is very small , that they &apos;re just sort of just a chance of making numbers , so they &apos;re not going to do the instructions that are actually doing this .
but one of those who may be a little bit of happiness in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences , which is my own way of the next .
and this is the one that &apos;s going to be the rest of the rest .
now all of the time , all the time that the numbers have best come to the best .
and that &apos;s a method of the most violent , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through exchange of their own , and the children are the characteristics of the two programs of the two programs .
so i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs , which were closer to the benefits of the benefits than others .
tell , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
so , you know , again .
maybe some mutations are going to be a few mutations .
and try to do this with another generation .
all these generations need a few milliseconds only .
and so i can go through a evolution of millions of years in the computer , and in more ways , some hours of a few hours .
finally , i get programs that can be perfect .
the fact is , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write from hand .
and then if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s irregular and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure they do the job because they come from a series of the programs that have done the job .
because your life was going to be the job of whether you did the job right .
i sat in a 747 with marvin , and he &apos;s a map of a map , and he says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
there &apos;s this plane , &quot; this airplane is made of the world &apos;s work , which are working together to make your flight safer . &quot;
we know that a computer system is not a optimal , if it &apos;s going to be too complicated .
so we start leaving on computers , for a process which is very different from classical engineering .
he allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it yet .
so , the technology is going to be the technology .
we &apos;re using these programs to make a lot faster , so that we &apos;re able to do this processes faster .
so it creates a more powerful .
it &apos;s going to be faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems like this .
because all of these new technologies of today are feeding themselves from themselves .
we raise off .
we &apos;re at a point , the analog is to be developed at the time , as a computer designer .
so we &apos;re the most powerful and we can &apos;t make it quite , what the hell we &apos;re doing here is actually creating .
we &apos;re in the middle of this kind of thing .
but i really believe that after us , something else comes .
i think it &apos;s very much more powerful to say that we are the final of evolution .
and i think we &apos;re all here to be part of the creation of what &apos;s going on next .
now , lunch is before and i think i &apos;m going to hear here before i &apos;m going to be more likely to be .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert with the sky with a lot of the street ali .
we talked about that , nothing has changed since the ancient indian indian &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted indians to travel at the time , we were going to go into a car and the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
and then , when the big indian , the great indian , he took a bow , he took a bow , shot in the ground and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with a little bit of the machines and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that really made me sad .
i got a little scared of technology .
it was scared that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without a camera and without tweet , without tweet .
i found that technology should make magic magic and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather was my little silver .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most violent thing for me .
she was a lot of a world &apos;s access to a world full of pirates and the ships in my imagination .
i came to the way that we were going to get our ancestors and cameras to dream .
they were inspired by that .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use it to kill magic instead of killing magic instead of killing .
and i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling , the readers can connect on the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it brings images and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
storytelling always took more senses .
but what do we do with this ?
i just go to the same time , a interactive ipad app app .
here &apos;s , &quot; take your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s , &quot; this box -- &quot; i &apos;m writing my name .
and from me , a character is going to be in the book .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad knows by gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the child in me is really excited about these ways .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean a magician and the dragon , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass , i always found very exciting .
so you have to go up here , and the fireflies down .
and the light bulb the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that was fascinated as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single a single one .
and so here every book is going to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a little bit of a bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit .
and this opens up a map .
and the way they had always got maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows and light and it &apos;s going to be a convincing in the rest of the book .
it &apos;s also a different way of the book .
i &apos;m going to go here .
it &apos;s important for me to make something that is a lot of time , but also very much more powerful .
this is the most powerful .
we &apos;ve heard all of the most sophisticated and the most important , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the most popular ?
the poor was caught thousands of years in the jungle in a old hospital , in a old book .
and we bring them back to a contemporary story for children .
a story that &apos;s been printed with new issues , like the most important .
the theme of the last 10 years is that kids are sitting in their rooms , in their own rooms , in their computers , without walking .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you have to go out and collect the camera of the avatar images .
as a child , i had collections of the street , rocks , and the tanks , and shells .
somehow the kids don &apos;t do it anymore .
this is the most important thing to get back . you have to go out to make a picture of a flower and tag .
in another chapter , you have to be a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece of a piece .
so , you actually create a digital collection of photos that you can ask online .
a child in london shows the picture of a computer and says , &quot; oh , today i saw a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; today i saw a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities that are the world and technology to connect .
in the next book , we &apos;re using a interaction where you use the video of the avatar , and through the limbic reality , a animation looks at a animation from the house .
on a place , the screen is going to be with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the brain &apos;s sound , you blow up and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the natural forces of technology come closer and in the magic and technology , and in the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and we &apos;re closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really a extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in the world , prisons or a lot of time .
i spend the most of my time with the social weakest in the world &apos;s office and in places that there are very much hopelessness .
and to be here at ted , and to hear how chop that is , i &apos;ve given a lot of power .
in the short time here , i was a clear one , ted has a identity .
you can tell things that have influence the world .
and sometimes if something about ted comes , it gets a meaning and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we saw some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher have meaning , but that &apos;s the words of an dedicated teacher , especially meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , but you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t have learned that in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional household , which was dominated by a portfolio , and this is my grandmother .
she was a very powerful , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every single single time .
she was also a lot of differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a computer .
their parents were born in the shops in virginia as a slave .
she was born around the jet , and the experience of slavery shaped very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also a lot of time .
when i met them as a little boy , she came to me and gave me a little bit .
they were so stuck for me that i could barely breathe . then they get me .
one or two hours later , if i came to her , she came to me and said , &quot; do you feel my hug ? &quot;
and when i said , &quot; no , &quot; you say , &quot; well , i said , &quot; yes , i was going to be quiet .
and she was something that was made that you wanted to be near her near .
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get their attention .
my cousins went around everywhere .
i remember , i have to be eight or nine , that i woke up a morning and went to the living room . all my cousins went around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the room and i went to the end of the room .
first , i thought that &apos;s a game .
i saw her and smiles , but she looked very serious .
that was 15 or 20 minutes . then she stood on and came to me . she took me to the hand and said , &quot; come on , &quot; come on , and i have to talk to you . &quot;
i remember that as if it was yesterday .
i &apos;m never going to forget it .
she took me out with it and said , &quot; i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t have to be a lot of time . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re a little special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;m never going to forget that .
then she said , &quot; you have to promise me three things , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i &apos;m going to love your mom always . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby and you have to promise that you &apos;re always going to care about them . &quot;
i &apos;m going to share my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother , i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
then she said , &quot; next , &quot; next to me , you &apos;re always going to do the right thing . &quot; even if it falls hard , the right thing to do . &quot;
i thought , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
and finally she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise me is &quot; that you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old and so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south and i have a brother who &apos;s older , and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , my brother came home and brought this kind of a beer to my sister , and i went to the forest .
we just put it around as well as otherwise .
then he took a drink beer and offered my sister of one , and she took them , and then she was offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . ok . do you just do . i don &apos;t want to do beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , we &apos;re going to do that , you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re doing anything that we do .
i had what , your sister had what . go , a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do it . do you just do it . do you just do . &quot;
my brother was going to be .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? well , what &apos;s going on . &quot;
then he looked at me in the face and said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not always going to do you even crazy because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother told all the grandchildren that they are special . &quot;
i was devastated at the ground .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
i should not do that .
this is perhaps a public being .
i &apos;m 52 years old and i &apos;m going to be a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s a lot of time , and i say that , because identity means it &apos;s going to be .
if we create the right way of identity , we can tell people about things that they don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they could not .
of course my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was during the prison in prison .
my uncle died on the street disease .
and she believed that this is the themes that we need to care about .
i tried to say something about our court program .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1993 , 300,000 people were in the prison and in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest death rate of the world .
seven million people are left on the ground or with a mild , and with a mild .
i think the world &apos;s world has changed our world .
in social weak and black parts of the population , despair and despair , because of this changes .
one of three male black black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , or with a little bit of a sudden , or with a coffee , or with a coffee .
in urban communities everywhere in the country -- from los angeles over philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of all black boys , either in prison , or with a little bit of the black , or with a coffee , in prison , or with a coffee .
and our system is not just shaped by questions that have to do with the most powerful , it &apos;s also going to be more nuanced by poverty .
we have a tank that they &apos;re treated much better when they &apos;re rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
wealth , not the way that the result is influenced .
yet , we seem to be satisfied with it .
a policy of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a few of the things that are there .
my home home , in the home of alabama , they &apos;re going to be able to be able to get the right when they &apos;re being convicted of it .
here &apos;s in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population is lost their own black population .
we &apos;re deciding that in 10 years , the percentage of the civic of the civic is going to be so high as the most powerful of the world &apos;s population .
the silence is a little bit of the silence .
i represent kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , the most important kids in the prison .
in this country , there are children &apos;s disease for children &apos;s brain .
we &apos;ve already been running a lot of ways .
the only country of the world .
i represent people in the world .
the question of death penalty is an interesting question .
we think because you &apos;ve taught us that the real question is : has a human being , a human being to die for a of the crime of the crime ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about it , depending on how we see our identity .
the other view is not : anybody for a crime , does it deserve death , but we made it , to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
death penalty in america is defined by error .
on nine people we were executed , one that we have for innocent is the most powerful , the most powerful and from death row .
an amazing thing . one of nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never fly somebody with a plane when nine planes , who are taking away , one of the most appropriate .
but somehow we &apos;re creating it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking much about these questions .
i talk about race and the question , whether we have the right , to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m going to be my students in the story of my students , and i talk about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , the time of the enlightenment , until the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
but for the men in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to fear .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror , which was shaped her life .
these older people are coming to me and say , &quot; mr , pacak , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re talking about the people , you &apos;re going to say that you should stop to say that we should stop to say that we should stop to do it for the first time in the history of our nation .
they say , &quot; no -- say , &quot; you know , we grew up with it . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the beaver and decades of the most prolific motivated is unacceptable and brutality .
and yet there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what makes our actions in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly going to get together .
we always create new tensions and conflicts .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s that we &apos;re not willing to be willing to get us to the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the the beaver is not to overcome the willingness to be the willingness to be the willingness to do the willingness to be the willingness to be the willingness to be the willingness .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were this willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve been thinking about the death penalty in germany .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood on my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply , you &apos;re talking to listening to that . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course it can never give you in germany . &quot;
it was very silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible to kill us for the systematic people .
it would be a little bit more aware of us , and they &apos;re aware of people . &quot;
i thought about it .
as it would feel , in a world , in the german state , the german state of people had been able to be able to be in the german state , especially if under a lot of jews .
it would be a little bit of the way .
it would be a little bit more like .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old south , we &apos;re going to go to people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted , 11 times higher when the victim is white , when the victim is white , when the victim is black , it &apos;s a little bit more than the victim . 22 times higher , when the victim is black , and the victim is white , when it &apos;s black . 22 times higher , when the victim is black , and the victim is white ,
and yet there &apos;s this mental dragline .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with that , with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities will be the most of the time , abuse , the , the most prolific , the most prolific .
i seem to be important to unite both .
because we ended up that we need more hope to have more commitment , more commitment , more commitment to be able to be in a complex world .
for me , this means the time to think and talk about the poor , the more subtle , which will never be at ted .
but think about a kind of way , and that &apos;s what &apos;s embedded in our own life .
we all have to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re also so rational , so we appreciate intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development don &apos;t only come from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief of our hearts .
it &apos;s this kind of thing that i think you &apos;re going to drive , not just to be open for all the light and the things that are also for the dark and the dark and the dark .
and the great thing that &apos;s the great thing that &apos;s the great politicians , once said ,
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted to do everything , but what we needed most of the time was hope , a mental guidance , the willingness to be a mental setup , and witness to be . &quot;
these mental guidance is the core of what i think is also the most important thing to do for it .
there are no distinction to technology and design that allows us to be very , very long , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears , and the ears , and injustice , and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity is very much more of us than if we don &apos;t have to do that .
she &apos;s going to touch them deeply .
as a young lawyer , i &apos;m going to meet the big privilege , pink parks .
and the day , the day again , again , again , after the other , they were going to go back to the other of their oldest friends , and they were going to be able to get these older women , and the most incredible women , the most incredible , the husband , the husband , the husband , the husband , john king , dr. king , dr. king , dr. king , dr. king , dr. king , dr. king , dr. king , dr. king , dr. king , dr. king , dr. king
so these women met and talked about it .
and then , i &apos;m going to call woman , and then i said , &quot; the &quot; , &quot; i &apos;m going to go to the city , and we want to talk to us .
do you want to be in the field of space and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , really like . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and just heard about it .
it was always so inspiring , so that &apos;s what it was like .
one day i sat there and i heard this women , and after a few hours , woman turned to me to me , and he said , &quot; well , say , &quot; well , tell me what the initiative is right for the same right . &quot;
what do you try to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to get to injustice .
and the people want to help people who were innocent .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the world &apos;s world .
we want to eradicate a lot of the world &apos;s energy system without a standard of the children .
we want to do something against death penalty companies .
we want to reduce the number of death rates .
we want to eradicate a lot of time . &quot;
i thought my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; well , &quot; the &quot; , &quot; and , &quot; the . &quot;
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to make you very , very tired . &quot;
then , woman was going to be a woman , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore , you have to be very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very
and so i think that the ted community should be the ted .
we need to have ways to put this challenges : this problems , this is sorry .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity , from our humanity .
i &apos;ve learned very simple things .
i &apos;ve learned a few very simple things .
that we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for everyone on the planet .
if someone lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t hear him , it &apos;s not just a disabled .
even who kills someone &apos;s , isn &apos;t just a murderer .
and because that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , there &apos;s a fundamental human being that needs to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with safety in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think that in many places that are the opposite of poverty .
and finally , i think , although you &apos;re so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so so that we &apos;re not going to be measured at the end of our technology , not to the things we develop , not at our intellect and mind .
finally , a society is not measured in how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged , but how they deal with the poor , the death penalty , the death penalty .
because in this context , we start to understand the real amazing things that make us feel .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story for conclusion .
sometimes i urge too much .
i &apos;m going to be tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas are going to predict our thinking , very important way .
i represent these kids who were convicted of very hard to be convicted of the very hard .
i go to the most violent and visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and the one is supposed to be a adult in court .
then i ask myself , how could that happen ?
how can a judge turn someone to turn it up ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night , i stayed too long , and i thought , my goodness , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he has to have a lot of time .
right , the judge , the judge has a lot of time .
you also would be able to do that .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think about it , i started working on a bill .
i had a six-year-old , poor black boy as clients .
and i started with this bill . the headline was , &quot; bill , my arms , &quot; my arms , &quot; the black , white clients , &quot; to treat a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit . &quot;
i explained to my bill , i explained that error of the world &apos;s office and the police are to consider .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , nothing more of the time that there is no more more important thing .
the next morning , i woke up and didn &apos;t know if i just dreamed of this crazy bill or actually written him .
and i didn &apos;t just have it to my horror , but i was not sent to the court .
a few months , and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided i was going to be my god , i have to give you a dish and this crazy case .
i went into the car and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard to do that so painful .
finally , i went out of my car and went up to the the court .
when i was the staircase to the court , there was a elderly , black man , the janitors in the dish .
when he saw me , he came to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; they &apos;re lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and i gave myself .
then he went to the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched something deep in me , identity , the ability every single one , to help a community of hope .
well , i went to the most popular .
once the judge looked at me , the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. lear , did you put this crazy bill ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
that i was written this crazy stuff .
and the most powerful came in and the street workers and workers .
in the most popular , the most angry of people who were angry was that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
i saw the janitors , and i went down to the janitors .
he always saw the window and could hear the whole thing .
he went and down .
finally , this older black man came with a very old man in the world &apos;s office and sat down directly behind me , almost on the most popular .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a pause .
while the break came in , the janitors were in the world that was the janitors in the world .
this is the most important thing running over the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the most violent ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he saw the most popular , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m a boy , to say that young man , lose the goal . &quot; don &apos;t give it the goal .
i came to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far more powerful , but that it &apos;s the justice .
that we &apos;re not completely developed as a human being , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and the most important .
that our survival of survival is connected to the survival of each individual .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and design , from entertainment and creativity to humanity , compassion and justice .
and i want to get those of you who are also seeing that , just say , you don &apos;t lose the goal of the eyes . give you not .
they have seen this audience , this community , and they heard a obvious wish to help them and do something .
what can we do ?
and the starrs , well , there &apos;s ways of all kinds of possibilities .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a very powerful one in this spring where it &apos;s about being a effort , something about the most important , something that &apos;s going to be in politics .
here , in california , you &apos;ll be a billion dollars for death penalty , a billion dollars for death penalty .
and yet , 46 percent of all the time of the world &apos;s population doesn &apos;t end with a more nuanced .
56 percent of all the time , not before the court .
here &apos;s the chance to do something .
this is the thing that &apos;s going to suggest to the money in more , and security .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
while the last three decades is the most powerful in america .
this is a fact that &apos;s often going to be asked to be a context of the increased .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
well , in fact , the number of the world &apos;s number is not really changed .
most of the most important in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of the world &apos;s class .
it was the most prolific of the brain &apos;s body .
so the dramatic high numbers come to the prisoners .
we have the rhetoric of the structural bias of punishment .
now we have &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the people who bring people to the ground , for a computer , for the theft of the theft , &quot; that you can raise the victims of the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people to help the victims of a computer system , not less .
and i think our current is not helping any of the things .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
and they &apos;re really going to have a string of the way that they have a string of the way .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
thank you that you were at ted . thank you .
is bin laden is going to take a increase to the process .
2 : famine in somalia . three : spray of the police .
and the other thing that &apos;s : the speaker &apos;s speaker .
six : social decline . seven : 65 dead .
and the speaker .
different speakers : the mass destruction . weapon of mass destruction . tornado .
recession . a standstill .
crisis . death . disaster . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but also the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative topics because our minds are going to get attention to this topics .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for it .
every second every day , our senses start much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we don &apos;t have any more important than our survival , the first station for all the information is part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early system , our main system .
it &apos;s going to be the whole information on the search of the whole information on the search of danger in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to keep it , to keep negative news .
and the old adage &quot; if it &apos;s going to be a little bit of the demand , the demand is very true .
well , with all our digital devices that we &apos;re seven days the week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s always worse .
but perhaps this is not the case .
perhaps that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the enormous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century is that we &apos;ve done a series of forces that are going to be able to make us in the next three decades , a world of abundance .
well , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have a big problem -- climate crisis , water , water and energy -- we &apos;ve already got .
and as humans are much better at that , problems on very long , but then they &apos;re going to get to overcome .
let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve achieved in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , which has been tripled in inflation .
child mortality has reduced to a tenth .
and that &apos;s what the most important thing is , the most powerful , and the cost of the world &apos;s cost of the world &apos;s cost of the world .
steve pinker has shown us that we &apos;re currently living in a very peaceful time of the world &apos;s life .
and according to charles abani , the most popular in the past 130 years is up from 25 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we &apos;re going to increase our expectations constantly .
in fact , we have poverty .
think of that a big percentage of americans who live under the poverty industry , access to electricity , water , toilets , mobile phones , mobile phones , air phones , air phones , air and cars .
the richest labeling of the last century , the world &apos;s most important , would never have such luxury .
the basis for a lot of it form technologies , and these grow the most powerful .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that is going to be the technology technology that &apos;s going to be a technology technology , and the curve of moore &apos;s law is doubling .
so , this is what the mobile phone costs in your pocket about a million times less and less than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , as smooth they &apos;re -- in good times , war or peace , the recession , depression , depression and the most powerful .
this is the result of faster computers that build faster computers .
it &apos;s slowed down for no of our big problems .
and also , despite your logarithmic , you &apos;re going to go up on the left .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available all of them .
&quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; , &quot; something that my friends call &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the ,
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm supercomputer . &quot;
it was great .
i &apos;ve been looking at newspapers and look for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson &apos;s human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the muffin of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence of a single owner was available to the owner of a computer .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i &apos;m here at ted a new university that means &quot; singularity university . &quot;
we bring our students all these technologies to the special focus on how these are used to solve the big challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students , companies , products and services that can affect in a decade of billions of people .
think about that , that a group of students can affect the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
today we can call the dozens of companies that have done this .
if i think to create abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for every one of the planets that are about to create a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating the goods of the surplus goods .
scarcity is a little bit of a resource , and technology is a resource force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of the bamboo century in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of the dinner to dinner .
and the soldiers got a lot of the time , and they got a little bit of the time , and they got a little bit of the time .
but the king of the king of the king was got a lot of time .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , valuable than gold and a cooling .
this is why the dome was made of aluminum .
although aluminum is a lot of the time , it &apos;s not going to come to the pure metal .
it &apos;s linked through oxygen and the most powerful .
but then the technology was developed , and it made gas so cheap that we use it with our own .
then let &apos;s put this analogy in the future .
we think today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet of the world with a planet of the more energy than we use a year .
16 , the energy of the energy is all the four minutes of the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is accessible .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time , the cost for solar energy in india to 50 percent of the most violent -- to 17 rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost for solar , in the last year , in the last year , in the last year .
last month , this is published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the united states , the u.s.
and if we have a reduction , we &apos;ll also have water in the abundance .
let &apos;s talk about the world &apos;s .
do you remember when carl meyer is the most popular 1990 , when it was on saturn , back in the direction of earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it be ?
&quot; a blue blue blue . &quot;
because we live on a computer system .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered to 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s a percent of water , two percent of water , two percent , and we &apos;re fighting about declining percent of the water , but there are hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new to the way , the way it &apos;s the way .
and from a conversation today , with dean , one of the innovators of the most innovators , i want to share with you -- i &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me permission -- his favorite , the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the
it can produce a thousand liters of clean water a day from different sources of different sources -- whether seawater , water water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents per liter .
the president of coca-cola has just been a big amount of a big amount of energy in developing countries .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , and i &apos;m very confident , coca-cola is going to apply global technology to the entire planet .
this is a innovation that &apos;s now the innovation that &apos;s today .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
you mean , god , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of the middle of the middle .
just think of a cell phone with a cell phone in the middle of kenya , a better player &apos;s office than president reagan .
and if you look at your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowing and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in abundance , like nobody ever could have predictions .
and it &apos;s better , the things that you have and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , and photograph , libraries , and the photo , libraries , and the medical , technology , is literally going to be more powerful and cheaper in your mobile phone .
and the best thing about that is perhaps what we expect in health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure , with the most called the &quot; $ 10 million of the time , &quot; &quot; $ 10 million of the things that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; $ 10 million of the things . &quot;
we &apos;re asking teams all over the world , all these technologies in a mobile phone , that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s related to ai , you can test the or your own , you can test your own or your own .
and to win , the device has to ask a better diagnosis than a team of doctors .
imagine that device . in the middle of a developing country , where there is no doctors , but 25 percent of the staff and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
if this device sequenced a computer or a half , the world &apos;s , it &apos;s not known , calls the health health , and it prevents a pandemic of your outbreak .
but now the biggest force that is going to lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them the coming billion .
the white lines are for population .
we just have the most popular .
and only by the way , the largest world &apos;s largest world &apos;s largest education is a better education and diet in the world .
in 2010 , we had been connected to two billion people online .
until 2020 , we &apos;re going to be a little bit of the world &apos;s internet .
three billion new heads we never heard before , will join the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what will you consume ? what will you want to do ?
and instead of using the economic idol , i see one of the largest economic systems of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that are going to flow in global economy .
and they will be able to get healthier , and they &apos;re trained to be trained by the most powerful , and they &apos;re going to be able to use the possibility , and they &apos;re going to use the possibility of the way that they &apos;re going to use , and so much more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the world &apos;s members of the world &apos;s members ?
as it would be with a sentence of new , never before .
how would it be , the oppressed , where you &apos;re , to give you a voice to make attention and create change , for the first time ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
how about the way that we can &apos;t even predict that ?
one of the things i learned through the x prize is that small teams , which are motivated by passion and focus , extraordinary things can create things that are big companies and governments in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really really was excited .
there &apos;s a program that might have a few people .
it &apos;s a game that is called the ai .
it was developed in the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein will develop .
the after his behavior can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the most important .
and it was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university university .
and it &apos;s hundreds of thousands of people who have played the game online .
and it showed that today the human pattern recognition is better than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked , who &apos;s the best most important of the world , it wasn &apos;t a computer designer , also no more , no one , it was a woman who was working on the day , the day , a woman who was working on a cartoonist of the world &apos;s day , and at night the best world was the best .
ladies and gentlemen , what &apos;s enormous to me in our future is the fact that we have more power today than individuals to put us in the big challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a computer .
we have the capital of the world &apos;s capital .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work online to master the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s necessary .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to have something against a computer model medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical medical and i &apos;m .
and maybe i &apos;m a long enough in business than i can give it a piece of my own wrong , to allow this to be a piece of my own wrong .
but before i get to the actual topic of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re the most close and moving to the world &apos;s world &apos;s world .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; the &quot; the &quot; is soon true and it turns around statistics and to use this great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to be able to get to a statistics that i hope that most of you have heard of .
it &apos;s the most powerful of the most powerful .
we talk about a 300 , if a bat is 300 .
that means that the player is safe three of 10 beats .
this is the ball in the world &apos;s water , and it &apos;s going to be , he &apos;s not caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball on the first base , it didn &apos;t have done time and the line was in security .
three from 10 of 10 .
do you know how to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a car in the ground ?
well , really good , maybe a more powerful .
you know how to call a computer company ?
this is the one of the things that &apos;s safe for four .
and the ted -- like ted williams , the last one of the most popular , baseball players of the player was met by 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world in the world of medicine , which i feel about a lot more comfortable or maybe a little less likely to do that with you .
suppose you have a more powerful and you &apos;ll be able to get a more of the time to be a little bit of a time of the world &apos;s disease , which is 400 in terms of the world .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
suppose life in a particular remote area and they have a beloved people with a regular , and their own business of the world &apos;s most powerful , whose favorite of the day is in 200 .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better . it &apos;s on the divine branch .
and she &apos;s beating a more powerful .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the most important thing for a computer or a nurse or a nurse or a nurse , should be a more , a more powerful one ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody in the whole medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor should be .
but what we do is we &apos;re not locked up , including me , in the world , to be perfect .
never a mistake , no one makes it a matter of the details , like this is going to be done .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was a ruler of a student .
in high school , a peers said that brian would learn to learn for a blood supply .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little little bit of the sisters in the sisters of general hospital , and i was in the sisters of general hospital .
i learned everything .
i learned the origins and the tail , every branch of every tree , every branch of every artery , which is from the aorta , which is the aorta , and ordinary and ordinary .
i even knew the most powerful to get the most sophisticated to the world &apos;s favorite .
and the time i collected more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i was going to be a lot of time with a little bit of a time .
and i left the medical school with the impression i knew if i knew everything and everything knew , or at least as much as possible , i &apos;m going to be immune to the way that i &apos;m immune to that .
and it worked for a time for a time until i met a woman .
i &apos;m going to be in a school of a school here in toronto as a woman in the hospital of the hospital .
and at that point , i was the most popular layer in the service service .
and it was my mission when the most popular advice was looking for the most popular advice .
and feedback to my favorite .
i studied woman &apos;s printer and she was in a lot of time .
and when i &apos;m going to get her to her , she made sound .
and when i was her chest with the most powerful , i could hear a sound sound on both sides , which said that she was suffering under the heart failure .
this is a state in the heart , rather than pump the entire blood on the pump , and it &apos;s a part of the blood vessel in the lung , and it &apos;s going to be the most short , so the most powerful .
and that was not hard to be a diagnosis of the diagnosis .
i asked them and made me the treatment .
i gave her a little bit of her . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call the water , water pills , so they &apos;re the liquid .
and over a period of a time of a half hours , she started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
i actually did two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my favorite .
i didn &apos;t take the following and i did what i should have , what was a call in my favorite room to get it to him , so that he had a chance to make a own picture .
and he knew it was able to get extra information to her .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the most popular doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so to take responsibility that i was so , and i would be able to worry about my patients without to meet him .
my second mistake was worse .
so that i sent them home , i was a quiet voice in me , trying to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . do it not . &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s very amazing to me that i asked the nurse who was interested in woman &apos;s printer , &quot; do you believe that in order , if you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it and said in the way , &quot; yeah , i think it will go to you . &quot;
i remember it as a yesterday .
so i was going to be the most powerful and an ambulance and a ambulance and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this very close feeling in my stomach .
but i was working on .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , and i went to the hospital , and went to the parking parking to drive with the car , when i did something that i didn &apos;t do .
i went through the most popular on my way .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen the wife , but one other three words to me and that three words fear , most of the most powerful ones i know .
other medical scientists are also afraid , but the care is very special because we just see the patients as well .
the three words loud : remember ?
&quot; remember the patient you thought about home ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular kind of thing .
so she was back .
she was back and dying .
about a hour she got home , after i sent her home , she broke up and called the family , and the family called the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; blood of the blood of 50 , which is a dangerous amount of time . &quot;
they hardly breathe and was blue , and it was blue .
the most powerful thing moved all strands .
they gave her their favorite .
she closed them on the top of the world .
i was shocked and to the inner , and i was shocked to the inner .
and i stumbled on this coup because they came to the intensive care system , and i hoped they would recover .
and after two , three days , they were never a bit of a cartoonist .
she didn &apos;t have a six-year-old of a lot of time .
their family brought together .
and the next eight or nine days , she was doing the most popular .
the day of the day , she &apos;s going to go -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say that you never forget the names of the world &apos;s name .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
the next weeks i made myself influenced and i learned the first time the unhealthy shame , which exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , not the way that you can talk to the colleagues .
you all know the healthy shame , if you have a secret of the best friend , although this one on the most important friend , and you &apos;re going to be caught and you &apos;re going to be faced with the best friend , and you &apos;re going to be faced with a terrible discussion , and you &apos;re going to be able to do that , you know , you &apos;re never going to do a mistake .
if you do the more important , and the mistakes never do again .
this is the kind of a shame of shame .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is that it &apos;s sick to make a in the heart .
it &apos;s the one that says that it &apos;s not what you did , but you &apos;re bad , it &apos;s bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t the reason of my favorite , he was very happy .
he talked to the family and i &apos;m sure he was the duty of the age and sure that i wouldn &apos;t be sued .
but i asked myself to do this questions .
why did i not ask the most important thing ? why do i send them home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
but slowly , it &apos;s going to put it .
i started feeling better .
and then , in a day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke up and i could be able to feel better again .
and i was with me that if i doubled my efforts to perfection , and never again a mistake , that the voice could be the voice .
and she did .
and i was working on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the world &apos;s office in a hospital hospital north of toronto , and i was a half old man with a little old man with a little old man .
it was a lot of go and i in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked at the most little and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him .
and even when he went from the door , he showed his favorite .
two days later , i came to my next day , and my favorite was asked me to be a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : remember ?
&quot; remember you on the patient with the patient &apos;s patient ? &quot;
it turns out he was a more powerful .
he had potentially a very potentially disease called the disease .
you can do that , but it &apos;s not infection of the most important , but the top of the top and causes the top of the world &apos;s most powerful .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got a little bit of a little bit of a few days later , and recovered a few days later .
and i went through the same of shame and patee , and i felt a lot of the time , and i was going to be able to get out of the work and again and again .
in a very , very , very , very , very , very , very much a bit of a time .
there &apos;s a lot of it , especially if you think you &apos;re working in a hospital that &apos;s just 14 patients a night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and there was no more fancy in their treatment .
i thought he would have been a lot of time .
i &apos;m going to be the x-ray of the kidney . when it was without a little bit of a time , my colleague was going to be a little bit of the patient in the lower right-hand sector , and called the surgeons .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i &apos;m going to get to him to get him to the other and asked my colleagues to get him to me .
and it did and he was in the right place , and he called the surgeons .
in both cases , it was a lot of time and it was good .
both cases of me , i &apos;m going to go to me .
and i would say to you , i &apos;m going to tell you that my worst mistake was just happening in the first five years , but a total nonsense is .
some of my favorite people happened in the last five years .
alone , embarrassed and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t close with my mistakes and talk about them , if i &apos;m the quiet voice , i &apos;m going to tell you what really did i do , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes , so that you don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i was in a room -- as well as i &apos;m right now , i don &apos;t know what you think about me .
when did you hear the last time of someone about the most violent about the world &apos;s office over the world &apos;s office ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about your own mistakes .
if i was full of colleagues , and to ask her immediate support , and to tell you what i &apos;m telling you , i would not have the end of the second story before it would really be uncomfortable , and you would not have the end of the second story before it really would be uncomfortable , and you would forget the issue , and you would forget the issue .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues , a computer in my hospital had been lost the wrong leg , then you think i would have problems to look at him in the eyes .
this is the system we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system that there is two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do that . those who are going to sleep and the shake that are going to be a breath with bad results and the good results that are with bad results and the good results with good results and the good results with good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological reaction like antibodies that attack a human being .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we &apos;re going to make the mistakes that are going to be the mistakes that we &apos;re going to be a safe system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of medical health , journalism , i have a personal medical study about medical mistakes , and wrong treatments to make all of me for a first article , which i was looking for for the toronto star , black species , black species , black species , black species , black species , black species , black species , black species , black species , black species , black species , black species , black species , black species , black species , black species , black species , black species , black species
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely more powerful .
we &apos;re working in a system in the every day , which is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a false or wrong , or wrong , and the more expensive and more more sophisticated and dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canadian , about 24,000 canadian mistakes .
in the united states , the institute of medicine is the number of medicine in 100,000 .
both are strong , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as well as we should .
and is the most powerful thing .
in a computer system that &apos;s all the two to three years , we can &apos;t keep it .
sleep is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake , so we can take a perfect kind of a patient with a patient with chest chest .
then i take the same patient with a lot of the patients , making it a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a breath and a slightly more likely breath and suddenly , and suddenly the story is the story of the story .
i don &apos;t take the same time .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things right .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms .
all of this is an mistakes inevitable .
so if you take this system , how i was taught , and all the most sophisticated , and all the time of the world &apos;s , is no more left .
and you know the most important thing about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , white , black , black , &quot; i have the habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would be able to say to every one of the most popular thing to the most popular thing , &quot; that &apos;s my worst mistake , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah
and then their sins expand , they &apos;re found out the head , and they &apos;re hard to go down and get food , and they start telling their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
you want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what you need is a environment which you &apos;re able to do in the situation .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new is a human being , a human , white , you know , is not proud of making mistakes , but it &apos;s not a little bit of a bit of to learn that , but it &apos;s going to be done by it , so it can be passed .
she &apos;s sharing your experience with other .
they supported if others talk about their mistakes .
and it shows other people , not to be a lot of the mistakes , but in a loving , kind of a loving way of doing all of this .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life and if that is so , people are also doing mistakes from time .
so that the system is developed to create the system that makes mistakes that make mistakes , which are inevitable , and it allows people to create it , and they also allow to create a lot of the time that they &apos;re going to be able to do the health care , and actually , that &apos;s what the potential of the potential is going to be seen , and that &apos;s actually what &apos;s going to be rewarded for the potential of the potential .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the new doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i do mistakes .
i &apos;m going to be a best thing to do , but i &apos;m trying to learn best to learn to give it other people .
i don &apos;t know what you think of me , but i can live .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , small idea .
it &apos;s about the most powerful .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories to use the time .
the first story is by charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , it &apos;s a lot of time that he was here .
they like to think that he &apos;s killing the most powerful , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he collected fish .
he described one of them as a very common .
it was a computer .
until the &apos; 80s , he was in great style .
now he &apos;s on the red list of species .
this story we &apos;ve heard many times from the galapagos or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the most important thing you &apos;re still describe as a commodity .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is a different concept , the most important thing , the most important thing .
because i &apos;ve experienced it as i was in 1971 , and i studied a napkin in a corporate field .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad debut and i was convinced that i really didn &apos;t have it from there .
it was my first samaritan .
as you see , the houston of the iq and a few of the trees are going to be .
there were a lot of about 20 inches of the day of about 20 inches , a senior one of the most powerful .
the world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world was very useful and the fishermen lived well , and they were doing good in ghana .
when i returned to the last one later , the fish was going to be taken on half his size .
and the more efficient thing you &apos;re going to get five centimeters .
they were genetically made of the way .
it was still fish .
people still were happy .
and the fish also had the happiness , there &apos;s still to be there .
so it doesn &apos;t change anything , and yet it changed everything .
my third little story told my favorite story of my favorite in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- more at the beginning of the &apos; 60s -- the &apos; 60s , many of the most powerful .
and the world &apos;s world meant the countries who started 100 fish , the industrial fishing of this pretty ugly ship called the fourth fifth ship .
i went to this and we made the census of the entire southern sea , and especially in the southern world .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know that it was the reason that it was the ocean .
90 percent of our favorite , the other animals , other animals , who are connected to the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there on the curtain , were the most powerful , the most powerful ones .
basically , the bottom of the ocean was on deck and then then went down .
these images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you &apos;re going to get a survey through and starts with the commercial fishing .
the reason is changing . from -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals will be a bit of the crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we started a living alive .
she wasn &apos;t drowning .
then they wanted to kill them because they could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain is going to be fed by the iraqi of the fishermen , if they &apos;re going to go in areas where they &apos;re never going to be in areas .
but it &apos;s not being documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we &apos;re going to fit our most sophisticated level and call us not in memory , which was there .
if you &apos;re going to get it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis , some good things are : biodiversity , number of the most powerful , the green of your country , the most powerful .
and the time it changes . it changes , because for people are their actions .
every generation of the images that they &apos;re taking to the beginning of their conscious life , as standard and it &apos;s going to affect everything .
the difference is then being seen as loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can give a order of changes .
and at the end , you just want to get the remains remains .
right now , our goal is mostly our goal .
we want to get things that are gone or things that are not like that , as they were .
you could think that the problem was that the problem was that you were sitting in the societies , and you were killing animals , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve been aware of , which was done .
because obviously , a animal is going to be very often , once it was , once it &apos;s going to be a little bit more , before it &apos;s going to be .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of the natural animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not going to be seen as a big loss .
and we &apos;re focusing on the time , we &apos;re going to focus on the big animals and the ocean that are the big fish .
they &apos;re getting rare because we start them .
and the time is little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the most powerful .
the question is why people accept this .
well , because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , many people are going to confirm scientists , suggest that it was really different .
they &apos;re going to confirm it because the evidence of how they &apos;re in a former form of personalized , not as they would like to argue the evidence .
for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report is a very , very big one , which is a big deal of the world &apos;s big , not used to be used , or not , because he &apos;s not &quot; scientifically &quot; , because he &apos;s not &quot; scientifically . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in the societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous big role that can play a marine marine .
because in marine marine disasters , we basically put the past back .
we &apos;re asking the past again that people can &apos;t understand because the most powerful thing is changing and very low .
so , people who see a marine marine , and the view of the view that allows you to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
what about people who don &apos;t get that because they don &apos;t have access to the middle of the west , for example ?
here , i think , the art and the movie may fill the gap , and simulations .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was a few years ago -- 500 years ago .
and the most important and the most powerful , you might remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , if you think about why people were touching this -- except from the most popular , why were they touched by the most popular ?
because it &apos;s something that was lost in a way that &apos;s lost in a way .
so my only , the only one i &apos;ll give you , is to be cameron , so he &apos;s going to be &quot; avatar ii &quot; under water .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in the communist , the communist , you had to , if you had a typewriter , that at the government .
they also had to be a sheet of the typewriter .
the reason that the government was , where a text came from .
found a paper with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the creator , and they could find the creator of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand the west , as anyone could do something like this , and how much the speech is being approved .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
but if you buy a new school system in 2011 , a new school of the leading world &apos;s leading , and print a page , then this page has bright yellow , and it &apos;s a site that makes the side of the side , which is clear to you and your printer .
this is what happens today .
and it seems to be a sense of it .
and that was an example of what our own governments that have the technology against us , the citizens , use .
and that &apos;s one of the three of the three of the three of the things that are existing .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening on the world : we can split attacks in categories .
we have three main things .
there are a lot of time .
for example , this is mr. &apos;s &apos;s favorite , and this is the gentleman &apos;s office .
and the motives of the world &apos;s motives are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use a lot of money to make a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of the world &apos;s disease , and they have a lot of time that they have made their money through attacks .
this is a little bit of a plastic of the plastic of plastic in estonia .
this is alfred &apos;s .
stephen watts .
and the most powerful thing .
these are matthew anderson , and so on and so on .
these people have been online to wealth , but they have illegal , by using the so-called for example , to provide money from our bank bank , while we do our online online , or also , the other thing that we &apos;ve been doing in the input , as we &apos;re running over a infected computer online .
the u.s. intelligence agency , two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam , and in this account , was a little bit of a million dollars , and in this account , the other thing was , when it was frozen .
mr. tse-tung itself is on free foot , the aerodynamic is unknown .
and i &apos;m saying that today , we &apos;re more likely to be victims of a computer system than a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be worse .
in the future , most crimes are going to play online .
the second second , we can see today , are not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests about , a opinion , or through their audience .
groups like anonymous are moved over the last 12 months , and they have become one of the most popular things in the field of the field .
so these are the three of the three , criminals who are doing it because of the money , like anonymous , which are able to afford to make resistance , but the last group are nations that lead attacks .
there are cases of how the most important thing about the world &apos;s .
it shows a lot of the way that governments are going to attack their own citizens .
and the netherlands is a kind of a more powerful thing from the netherlands -- or it was it .
in the last fall , it had to be a little bit of a time , because it was a lifelong .
somebody was hacked and had a lot of a little questionable .
and last week in a meeting , i asked a man &apos;s favorite one of these group , whether he was able to do it for possible , that because of the most popular people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying of such remote online ?
and the most powerful thing is a computer system .
they sell the most powerful .
what do you do with the most powerful ?
now , a certificate is required , if you have a website with a website with a family service , for example , to be rigid .
now , we &apos;re using all of us , or many of us , rigid or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly spread in the states like iran , where the other people are using the foreign , where they can use the other people , because they know that they can &apos;t trust more trust than the other people , and they &apos;re not able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
but you can , if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign .
and the most fake , and fake , and fake .
and that &apos;s what happens in the case of the field of the field .
how do you do it with the arab spring and the things that are happening for example in egypt ?
now , in egypt , the experimenter in april , the headquarters of the egyptian , and they found a lot of records .
in these records , a folder was called &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in this folder , notes were a lot of the company in germany , which had sold a few programs , which had sold a few programs that they were -- in very large frame of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for the egyptian government .
the most important thing is that there &apos;s exactly here .
so western governments are interacting with the governments with their own citizens , so that they can make their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , there &apos;s a few weeks ago , and that was a bright , which was used by german , to get their own citizens to the other citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be in a more nuanced , you &apos;ll be able to get your phone to your phone .
but today we are far beyond .
they tap their internet connection .
they use resources like the most powerful , to get their computer with a bright , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their own communications , their own territory .
so if we think about these things , the obvious answer would be the most obvious answer of people : &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a good citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i don &apos;t have to hide . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy must be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we today , in 2011 , our governments like trust , is every right that we &apos;re going to be able to do for always , forever .
and trust , we trust a blind government , a government that we may have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to do the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the world &apos;s .
the first one was made of the first , and the first one was made of a simple idea : namaste from cement with a ride , which fit .
and the very quickly , very quickly , the most quickly the world &apos;s most quickly in the world .
they put us in the situation , to build things bigger than we , buildings , bridges , a stone after the other .
basically , the most important thing was to the building block of our time .
almost hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of this .
it was called &quot; automatically scientific stone . &quot;
and within a few years , lego moved into every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it for all possible .
lego has basically the most important , the building block of the world , and it took a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the same year , the next year was announced the next revolution , the next building block .
the transistor was a little bit of a little bit of a world that was a world of static , and the building blocks of the static building building in all interactive .
as the most important , allow us to build a lot larger , more complex varieties of plastic , a stone after the other .
but there &apos;s a computer company : the transistor was only for experts .
i personally accept that that the building block of our time is for experts , and therefore i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started exploring this idea , how to make the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing in a few years ago .
let me show you how you work .
and the electronic shifts are electronic farms that have a specific function .
they &apos;re a little bit of the light , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best thing about it is that they connect with magnets .
so you can &apos;t put them around .
the stones are the ones .
green is fire , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange cable .
so everything you need to do is a blue and a green and a green , and you can build very quickly larger .
they add a blue one to a green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch between it , and you have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
take the switch out to a little bit of a computer , which is here , and they made a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
add this kind of thing to a extra effect , and they &apos;ve made a more powerful .
i &apos;m going to stop this .
the simple play is actually quite powerful , actually , quite powerful .
instead of that you have to code , or you have to do it , or you have to do it with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to accelerate the burger , or slow to slow , just turn on this button and it makes it a impulse faster or slow it down .
the idea behind the most powerful is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world in a world &apos;s rock .
lights , sound , the motors , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve spread in children and they &apos;re playing with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how they start to understand electronics that they &apos;re going to be in the everyday life and they don &apos;t learn in school .
like a kind of a computer company , or why the doors of the world &apos;s doors , or how a ipod is responding to touch .
we also have brought up to the world &apos;s most powerful .
so , for example , we had designers with no experience in electronic things that started playing with a material .
here we see , with a little bit of the time , paper and water bottles , like the ...
a few weeks ago , we &apos;ve got to get risd and gave them some designers that had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a more powerful one .
but wait , this is really my favorite thing .
it &apos;s a certificate from play-doh who &apos;s scared in the darkness .
for these kinds of things , a more material , a little bit of a material , electronics was just another material .
and we want to make this material for all available .
so , the open open source is open source .
you can go to the website , all the time , and you can make yourself make yourself .
we want to be the world of creators , the inventor , the cdc , because that world , where we live , that interactive world , belongs to us .
so , pull out and start to invent them .
thank you .
