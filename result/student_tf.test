just that know that that a of , , the the the the way the the the the the the of of of of of of of of of of of the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
and of course , we all all the same same thing .
we &apos;re going to be born . we &apos;re to to kids world .

it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s a the the the the the the the the the , , the the the or or or or or or the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
all these people teach us that it &apos;s other other other other other other other other other other ways ways ways the earth earth
and that is a idea that you think about it about , , just with with with .
together , the the cultures of the world is a net of of the and and life that the earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth the the the the the the the the the , as as as as as
you can imagine this cultural cultural as a a a of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , of the the the the the
the most powerful is is great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol all what we &apos;re we and what we we we to to to amazing . .

and the key injustice for this is the of languages .
when everybody was born in this room room , , the talked talked languages languages languages languages languages languages
now , language language not just the the of the the of the or or of of of of of
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a tool that the the the of a of of of to the the the .
every language is like a a forest of the mind , , a , , a a , a a wise possibilities .
and from those 85 languages , we we &apos;re in in in in , , , , half half the the the the the of children children
they &apos;re not going to be the anymore . it means if happens is is you already already already already already already already .
what could breathe be be be be the the of of of of of of of of of of people people their language language language language language language to to to , , , to to to hope hope hope hope hope

what i first you you , so fast as quickly possible , , , is basic basic , , new new technology we we we we a a a a of of of of a of of a of of a of of of of of of of ,
we see a lot of many many of digital , here that that you you and and and , , , , , , , , , , ,
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at how how big these are are or or are are . .
most of you are digital digital of a camera , but this is is for for for the the the library and it it in a a of 300 300 300 300
it doesn &apos;t make difference difference because because only only thing the performance of of a like like this this is number number number number on on of of , , , , , a a a a a . . . .
this is a whole book , a example of a example of
this is a house house of of . every every is a chapter .
to prove that it really really about a text and not about a picture , , can do something something something to that that that that that real real real of of of of of of of

and that are really that the pleasure and the good experience a a a a a magazine newspaper newspaper newspaper newspaper newspaper a a of of of of of of of of of
we also made something on the corner of the particular of of the the of the
we designed designed false false with very high high high high , that is more higher than a a a and and we we we . . .
if you want to see the functions of this cars of cars , you can see here .
or other models , or even technical technical .
and this is really this ideas ideas these these these for for for the the the screen screen screen screen screen screen screen screen screen
we hope that that doesn &apos;t &apos;t and and other other -- -- should &apos;t be be .
of course , the environmental is a of of the applications applications for technology this .
and i really &apos;t to spend spend much lot time , , , say that we we we to to to this this .
but these are all streets in the u.s. states
the , the the of the the of of of of of of of of
let &apos;s get something else else .
so that is live live in the internet . you can can it it
this is a project with the name of the name , that really two two different other .
one is a one of the the the the the is very very good research research of of of of of of , , university college college college college college of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of
and rick &apos;s made microsoft microsoft research was a very good collaboration collaboration .
so this is live in the internet . it &apos;s driven by by by .
you can see that if we we this kind of of of of that we we we through images images and and of of of of of
but the of of the images is here in in in .
the main of that these these images together together together together that the the the the the the the that that that that that all the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ve seen to to other other other .
there are what that are much lot of
i &apos;d like to show the one of the the of of of of of of of of of of of of of of we we we we we in to to to to to to to that that that that that that that that that that that that
we had to worry to the of the lawyers . .
this is a a of the guardian , lady who who only in computer computer with of of of of , , , just just in in in , and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and
so this is all all of , , and all all all all in in in in in in in .
and we can navigate on this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i i going to work microsoft microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the national here .
and , , you can see that that that many different different different of of of of : , , , , the the the the the the of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the weird .
many of you are from faces .
somewhere here &apos;s a series of mine -- here are they .
this is actually a poster of the lady , that was taken .
we can change from the poster of a physical view of this environment .
the point is that we can do things with social social environment , it will going going to data data all all all of of of collective memory , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . . . .
all these photographs are going to connected each and it it something that bigger bigger bigger than sum sum parts parts parts
they get a model that comes out the the earth .
look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen of of earth earth
and that is something that that through the complexity , with people use use , and and use use use the the the the the the .
their own photos will going to be with a , , , person person person person person
if someone did the to to , and and all these these , , , , , , , , , , , , picture of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of
and of course , nonsense all all the the the rich virtual of of of of of of of of earth earth of of , , just , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
thank you .
so , you you you you you software software software to to a certain time time time the the the , , , all all the the the world world be be in in in in world
yes . it doesn &apos;t make anything else than .
if you want to make them to the the .
and they do this because of the the the the .
and that is really exciting when you think about the most of the the of the of of of of of of of
as if you &apos;re a a of pictures pictures pictures where they they sentences sentences and the the of of of of of that that that that that is is .
but how would it be if the picture picture them with all all your
then the scale of the the of the the , and the the of that that that , , , it it it &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s classic
terry , that &apos;s really incredible . you you .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things of my book book , i i i in the the with things things things &apos;ve &apos;ve heard heard and and and and and to to to try try to to if you you you not not not . .
i want to start with what i call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .
the official of the what ?
the official of the all western western western societies societies
the official of the works works works our goal goal goal the of of of of our citizens citizens , is is the the the of of the of of
the reason that that freedom freedom is is good , , , , , , , , a a of for for . . .
if people have freedom , everybody &apos;s of us us to do things things that our our our our , and and and us us us us us .
the way freedom to is is to . .
the more choices people have , more freedom freedom have they and and more freedom have have have have more more have have .
this is , i think , deep deep in our our , that that it no no be in in to .
and it &apos;s also deeply in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what us us us us us us .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say something about about about about about
there are random of my my my , when you you &apos;t the 10 10 of of of of of of of , they they they they they could could could to a big of of of of of of of of of the the the the the the
so that is how the supermarket is .
and then you go to the the of business a a a a a -- -- , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , a a many many many many many
we can put a of of of different different different are are that that that that that in in . .
you have to admit that that is a big choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a young boy , because could could have phone phone phone you wanted to as as as as he he he
they put your phone . they didn &apos;t have it .
one consequence of that was that the telephone was broken broken .
these days are over .
we &apos;ve now a infinite leader of mobile , especially especially the the the the phones phones phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is the the the middle -- the the -- , , , , , , .
and you you &apos;t &apos;t have this to in business business business you you you sure sure soon soon soon soon soon soon soon soon
and what it &apos;s is it it to to to to to the the and to question question
now you know what the answer answer answer question question ?
the answer is no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t too too too too
in other aspects of life , that that very much much than than the , , the the the the the of of .
health -- it &apos;s not longer the case the the united states they they to to doctor doctor doctor doctor doctor you what .
instead , they go to the doctor doctor doctor doctor , , you we could could a or could could b b b
a has this benefits and risks .
b has this benefits and risks risks . what do you do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has this benefits and risks has has these these benefits and risks risks
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you would , , doctor , , would you do do ?
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds sounds good good thing but reality reality reality of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of
there &apos;s a huge marketing for a drugs for for people like they , , , you think think think think , , &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t buy buy buy buy
why do they do about us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : they expect to to the the the the morning morning to to to to change change .
so something like our our identity identity is is question question of of of , how show show .
we &apos;re not a identity , we invent them .
and we invent so as we we we to . .
that means that every day when you wake up morning morning , you to to to to to to to to of of of .
in terms , marriage and family , there was a time where the the the the was almost almost almost one and and and and so they so so they they they they they they they they they they they
the only real choice was &quot; who &quot; , not , not not they they they they . .
today , all is just . .
i teach wonderful smart students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 less less than than i i
and that doesn &apos;t because they &apos;re less smart , and not they &apos;re less uncomfortable .
it &apos;s because they are busy with other things , they ask yourself yourself , &quot; i i i i i i i i i i
should i be later ? i i i kids kids , or or or ? ?
these are all of of questions questions
and they &apos;re going to ask these questions of that that that means that do do do do i i i i to to to to class class class class class class class class class class class class class class class class class class class class class class class
and in fact , they should do that . these are important to to .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , how carl has has with with technology technology us us us each every every every every every every -- -- -- -- -- -- the the the the the the
there &apos;s a corner of that i i &apos;m going to to to the the the the the the
i &apos;m not going to tell you because because i want to use it .
so what it means means incredible incredible freedom of choice choice we decisions in in in work , , again again again again , we we we work work work work work work work work work work work work work work work work work work work work work work
we can play our kids with football , and we we our mobile phone on a a , and our our , and other and and and and our our our our our our .
and if if you &apos;re all the the of , minute minute minute we we we we child child child of of of of of we we we , , should should should should
should i answers to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and if though the answer answer to the question &quot; &quot; , is is it going to to experience experience experience experience experience experience of of of of it
and we look , big things and small things , material things , , , life is question question of of choice .
and the world in we saw looked like .
so i want to say , there was some choices , , , but but everything was a of of choice
and the world in we now now now this .
and the question is , are that good good bad bad news
the answer is &quot; yes .
we all know what good about about , so i i going to about about about about about about
all these choice have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , , way , , is &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s to to .
so that many options you you can choose , , it it to to to to to to
i &apos;m going to give you a another of example example a a a about in in in . .
a colleague of me had access access access of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of .
and what they was was a 10 of the the the the the the the the the the the of percent percent
they offer 50 of of -- 10 10 percent less less than than if they they five five five five
because it &apos;s 50 of the are are are are are , , is &apos;s so hard to decide decide decide decide to to to to to to . .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , tomorrow course course course course course .
understand understand that that &apos;s not just to people people to to to to to to they they they they because because enough enough enough enough enough enough enough enough , , , , that that that that that that that that that to their
and the &apos;t , , they to to to to to dollars dollars year year year year the the , , to to to to
sputnik is a consequence to many choices .
and i think it &apos;s the world that that like .
they want to to decision decision decision , it &apos;s for for all , , right right right
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment of the , or or wrong wrong wrong
so this is a effect . the other effect is that even even even we we the and and a , , we we we we less with with the the the the the , , when we we we we we we have to
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is is by the big choice different different different different different of , , you buy , , , it &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s that that that that that that
the more possibilities it are , , easier is it to to to that that &apos;s for for choice choice choice .
second , what economists call call .
dan gilbert did made a big point today by the how how how way we we we things things we we we we we . .
well , if there &apos;s very lot of alternatives , it it just just to to of alternatives alternatives that they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they .
here &apos;s an example . for the of you are not new new new , i i .
but here &apos;s what you should think think .
here &apos;s a few on the lowest .
very expensive real .
beautiful beach . great day . they have all for for themselves
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; &quot; the man thinks &quot; it &apos;s . .
everybody in my favorite neighborhood is gone .
i could park right my my house . &quot;
and he &apos;s been two of of of the of that he he the opportunity to day day day a a a parking parking parking
and , the happiness happiness happiness that we we we we we we , , , , we we we we we . .
and the more possibilities it are to choice , more more properties properties of these these are in the the the the
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon makes some of . .
he makes a statement about life now now and and and do do do do .
but a importantly point that he is is always always always decide decide for for for to worry don don do do do do .
and these other things like many many properties properties , and it it going going do do do do do do less less
third : the expectations .
this is me me when i wanted to be my neck .
i &apos;m wearing hat , almost the whole time .
and there was a time in it just just a a of a kind , and they bought bought and they they have bad bad , they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they , ,
so , went to to to , for for years years years years years the the , , , i i i i i i i i , , , , , , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the gymnosophist said , &quot; you you want to be , , , or or ?
do you want to get or or ? ? ? or ? ?
do you want to be shirt with holes ?
you want to go down down , , , , , blah blah blah said said said said said said said said
my helicopter was down and after i i i i i i i i like to the way way way way way way way way
he had no idea what that was , so i spent a hour with all this hat hat , , and and and and and and and i i the , , , , , , , , i i i ever ever
i had better . all these these these to to to it it .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to to myself myself myself
the reason that i was myself myself to with all these these these these , , , my my , , , , , , , , , , , .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations , when it were just in a kind way .
when they came up 100 100 , , , , of you would be be be be .
and what i was was , but it wasn not perfect .
and so i &apos;m i i i i i i i i i i i i was was was to to to to i i . . .
and add of the in the of of people people people people people people people people people people be be be . . . .
and this leads to less happiness with the results results results results results results results .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this this because if you they it it , know know all it &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s . .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that that was better better everything everything everything everything everything everything was was was was was to make make make make make make to a surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise
today , in the world in we live -- we we we , , , citizens , with with , , the the best best you you hope hope you you you you you you you you you you you you you you
they &apos;re never going to because because because expectations expectations expectations expectations , , , .
the secret to the the of -- that is is all all all -- -- the the the the the the expectations expectations expectations expectations expectations expectations expectations expectations
i want to say -- a short of a -- -- -- i i i i i woman , and and really really very .
i couldn &apos;t have better better better i i &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t to to
but it is not always a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of the the of a bad bad bad bad bad bad , a a a of of of of of , , , they they they , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , is
if hundreds of the different are are available of , , they buy a the the , and and they why why why is is responsible ? ?
it &apos;s also that the answer answer the question question : : .
they could do better better better .
with 100 different of of , in the the , , there no not for . .
and so , people meet decisions , and even the results of of decisions are good , , you you to to to to . .
clinical depression is in the the world in the the generation .
i think a a -- not the only , but a a of of a of of of depression , , , , , , people people people people people have have , they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they
and so this is the thing thing that that &apos;s &apos;s us better , , and we we ourselves ourselves . .
so let me remember you .
this is the official of the the , that that all all all all all , , wrong wrong &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s
there &apos;s no question that is better better better than not , but it doesn &apos;t , more more better better than than than . .
there &apos;s a magical amount of it don &apos;t know what it &apos;s .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve this this point long the the choice choice our our .
now , when a key question -- i &apos;m almost -- -- a a question question question thing about about about about that that these these these these the the the the the the the the the the the the
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of you you not not not the . . . .
your problem is that they have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about a strange of of modern , , western western societies societies .
and what is so so and and is is , , , you about about about how that expensive expensive expensive to to to to to to it it it it it waste waste waste waste
what i &apos;m telling you that that these efficient , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not just that &apos;t help .
they &apos;re hurt .
they worry about that we we bad . .
if something &apos;s the the people to to to our our our to to to to to people people people people be be be be not life life life life , , but but but but but but but be be be
economists call this a a a .
so , &apos;s is is that that that that &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s not not -- -- -- -- because because because because these . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
finally , you you this this cartoon , , , , a person person , , , , &quot; ah what this fish ? ? ? ?
you know &apos;t know it in this this this .
and imagination , a a view of the world -- and that is the way of i i . .
but the more i about about it , more more more i i to the the the the fish fish
because the truth is that if you break the the the , that that that that possible possible , , , , have have . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
if you break the the the , that that that that possible possible , , , happiness
they increase the sputnik and and the happiness .
everybody needs a a of .
this is almost to limited limited , -- -- perhaps the fish fish fish , for . .
but the most thing thing is is a a a a a a for for , , , , , , , . . .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects projects about about the human genome and what what that and and and the of of of genes genes genes genes genes genes genes genes genes genes genes genes genes genes genes genes genes genes genes genes genes
in fact , we start from a new point : we have the biology and now we we try to to digital digital digital digital new new new new new new new new new new .
we always tried to ask a questions questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i think that biologists to to understand understand and and and different different . .
we have to to different ways to to it to the the components components
we &apos;ve almost 20 20 years years . we we we the the the the the the the the the world world world digital digital digital digital digital the
now we we to ask whether whether we can lives life whether whether we create new new , , this universe universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , , , , the the genome genome of a of can can the the the the lab lab and we we we we we we we we we we we . .
we &apos;ve made to to to about hundred hundred genes 500 500 500 500 that that that .
but if we look at this this map that is very very simple , compared compared comparison , trust trust , me , , but but we we we at at we we we we we we we we we we we we that we that that that that
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to the the the the the to to to to to to to to to individual components individual and of of questions questions questions questions questions questions questions questions questions questions questions questions questions questions questions questions questions questions questions
and so we started with the question , we can do a ritual of
do it allow the chemistry really to to to , , , never never done
and , if we can , that can can start the
a chromosome is just a way of of of of chemical material material
our steps of the are of life were organized .
our ability genetic code to to very very slowly , yet yet and and last final would would would would would a curve curve curve curve curve
we started 15 15 15 years ago
it actually took some years years with a a of before before we we first first first first first
so it out out out very very very . .
there are tens of machines of of the the world world the little of of of , , , , , , , , but a a a a a , of of of of of of of of of more more
so we had to develop a new method with we we we little little pieces pieces and and and mistakes .
this was our first attempt to try with the digital information , the genome genome x .
it &apos;s a little virus of bacteria .
we built small pieces , did a dramatic and had a dna molecule about about about . .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of of chemical chemical chemical and and and bacteria bacteria bacteria bacteria software started started started started code and and and and
the total particles were been by the cells cells and and back and and and charles .
recently , i talked talked the oil oil oil and they they they that this this model .
they laughed more than her it it .
so we think that that is is situation in the the software the the the the in in in a system system system system system
but we wanted to go a lot of the of of we we wanted build build a whole whole , it it more more more more , , , we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer in computer computer information information information .
when we first the genome station in station the the the the a a a a 10,000 10,000 .
we found the the of of mistakes mistakes , if we we the the sequence sequence would never never possible possible possible
part of the design is to make , , , are 50 letters letters , and and other other other other to to to to build smaller of of of these these
we &apos;ve been elements here here .
they may hear that we we have have have .
think about this : we have a a code code : , , c c g and and
so , this letters letters letters letters letters letters , about 20 20 , , there there there one one of of of these these these amino amino .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , , .
we , we just just .
some people were disappointed that it was no poetry .
we &apos;ve designed the pieces that we we could them them with with with , there there are these these and and and and and . .
and we started making to to with with with the the the to to to to to , , , , to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to
in every step , we have created pieces pieces in the the , we we we we because we create create very process process process process to to you in a . . .
we tried to get the point of the the of the
so , this looks like a a of .
if we get to to right right big big -- with 100,000 100,000 100,000 -- -- not not not just just in in in , , , , , , , , , , , and and and and and we we .
we knew called called a a of the the of the the the that that biology to to dna that that that that that together .
here &apos;s an example of of . there &apos;s a organism called called the the the the the the the the of
you see in the upper field that his glue just just apart .
12 to 24 hours later , , has all together as it it it
we have thousands of organisms that do that .
these organisms can be completely up , you can even be in the vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life in space in space and move move on on for for conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there there lot lot of of there there there there there
here &apos;s a a of the molecule that we made created by by these these -- actually actually we we use use use use the design design design the design of , , , , , , automatically automatically automatically automatically automatically automatically automatically automatically automatically automatically automatically automatically
this is not a a of it it a a
it &apos;s so a molecule molecule that we can see it with the the of .
these are images about a duration of six seconds .
that is the the of that we just been . .
these are about the of letters of the code code it it &apos;s the the molecule the with with the the of of of of .
it has a a of about 300 million million .
if we would put it with a a of 10 and and without without , , it would would to to to to to to to genetic genetic code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code code
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we do it ?
obviously , it &apos;s is a a a a simple simple . it &apos;s more complicated with with with
it &apos;s also easier , you &apos;re it it in in of of we we we it it just just just the the the and and and and and and and that that that that that that that that about about about about about about
in the , of the the the , the the , , , we we we we we we we that that a a a a of of of a of of of and and and can and and
we have the the the the a a a a a , , , , , two two as as as as as people and and and we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we
the new impulse went in the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we tried to to the process to to
this is the most of of evolution evolution .
we all find the species of species here a a second a a or a third of of of of of of of of of of of of a a a a a a species
so people that that evolution to a a gene a a a a a of of biology biology biology
there are the that are called the the the dna . .
the x-ray that was in the cell , no the the that we we &apos;ve .
it was the in the cell of the cell and and and the other other than than , , , , and and and , , a a a a a a . .
it &apos;s the of of of of of of genes we we we
and after a very short time , it had lost the characteristics of species species and and completely completely new new species species new new software we we we the the the . .
all proteins changed changed the the , , -- we we the genetic code code , it it what we we we . .
it may sound like the , , but we we , move move the the the , , , , , . . . . .
now i &apos;ve that that this is not the the thing -- -- is based the billion billion years .
and i have that that we may have to create a new form of the the explosion that that that new new new new new new on on on . .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in what what we need .
we &apos;re in nine nine nine nine billion people the next next years years
to ask it in my context , i was born in in . .
today , three people on on planet planet for in in in in in , in , , years years years four four four four four four four four four four .
we have problems with food , with with and clean water water , , , fuel fuel billion billion billion .
it will going to offer a challenge for nine .
we need about five billion tons tons coal , , , , billion of oil are are are million million million million of of day
if we think about biological processes or or process process to replace it it it a challenge challenge challenge challenge challenge challenge challenge
then , of course , there &apos;s the whole co2 of this material that that in the atmosphere .
now we have , from our discoveries of the world world , a database about about 20 million , and and i i to that that that the the the the the future future future future future
the most of of a cloud components and and see the diversity diversity of of that .
we &apos;re going to get here in the line of the the of biological of of of of idea .
we have today today of of this this this fast to do do do do we we we we . .
now we have the opportunity to build a opportunity robot robot the of of of of of day
if you &apos;re to this 20 20 different different genes genes or these these these or or or or , , , , , can can can a a a a a a last last last last last
and it &apos;s just a of of selection , we can can to to of of of , , , , , , , , , and
this is a recording of really of of we we we we &apos;re &apos;re you you actually up up and and new the the the the the computer
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it will going to look . we know exactly what genetic code . .
now we &apos;re on on on the the the generation .
they &apos;ve seen to to , what just a a experiment .
we have been the the the the third third generation generation the the the the the the the the more more more more of of of of of of of of of of of of
but , how we think that only only kind of this a a a without without without without of of or of of of of of of , , , , we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we that that
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first with the the generation the the fourth , and and about 18 18 . .
sunlight and co2 are a method --
but in our discovery of the world , we all have kinds different of different .
this is a organism we described in . .
he lives in the sea , about the deep miles , , , almost almost almost
it &apos;s co2 in methane to the the of of of energy energy .
we &apos;re going to we use use co2 co2 , , which can be to to to to to to to co2 co2 co2 co2 co2 to to to process process process
within a short of of , , we think we could be able able able able of of of of of life life
you know , we really -- -- -- of of of the the the the the the the , , , you you you you you you where where where where where where where where of of energy energy
but we we &apos;re working to to the the same same same for for of of . .
they saw this this this year the flu , we &apos;re always a year back and and and a a a a a if the the the the the
i think that &apos;s be created by by by by in in in the
this is how the future may look look the with changes changes , can can can to to to the with with bacteria , , , , , , , , , and
we are light of them from people people , our goal goal is that we we we chance chance chance to enough enough enough enough to . thank thank thank thank thank you much much much much much much much much
on the last ted conference , i was a introduction to the . .
and i promised back to explain you explain explain the machine machine .
so it &apos;s as as , and for all those those the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the miles diameter . . . . . .
his job is to create the conditions which which less less than a a second of of the universe -- and and and and 600 times a a . . .
it &apos;s just just embarrassing .
this is the machine underneath from . .
we take images of these these of in in in in .
so this work , i &apos;s called he called called -- -- -- feet the the the the the the the the . .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the the in the construction in the construction .
the the 10th 11 last , the machine was to the the time time time
and this picture was taken by the .
it &apos;s big big of the in in .
it &apos;s a picture of the first first first first the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the of of of of of of of of of of the the the the the the
in other words , when we saw this picture picture the the 10 , we knew that machine machine , is is is . . .
i don &apos;t know if this &apos;s the largest largest , , , , , , someone someone google google page page page page the the
it means that we &apos;re a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine with do with with with with this this this golden golden . .
these wires are going to the the the the the machine machine machine on on on
well , the engineers of you &apos;re going to look at and , , , , , , &apos;t &apos;t do that that . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . &quot; .
you can afford that because if you &apos;re very very far , you you to to to to
so at minus degrees degrees , , as the the space between the stars , the these can that tension .
in one of the connections between between over the the , in the , there there a a a .
so , the wires are incredibly and and and of of , , .
this was the result .
now , this is is is when you you that that the the of of 20 of and around about about 30 inches
so we filter about 50 of the retina
and they had to get what we we . .
we &apos;re them new , , , .
now , &apos;re all back back back their path
and the end , the the will be be back back
we &apos;ll going to put him , and and first data data in in , , , , , , journey journey journey journey journey out out out the the the the the universe universe
now , of course , on a kind of this , , the the the the the the the of of of and and and and and it it it it it it . . .
i think the fact that it is so hard that that that that we we we our our our our , of of of of of the the the
i &apos;m going to leave my final of a english scientist english english english , , , , , , , , , i i i i he he he he he he he , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
thank you .
i &apos;m writer .
books to write my my job , but it &apos;s course than than .
it &apos;s also my big , , love and and .
and i don &apos;t expect that the will will change change .
but , , something weird strange in my my my my my career i to to me to my my my my to work work .
this is event was that i wrote recently a book book a a a called called called called , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , of of of of of of of the the the the the the the
the result is that i matter matter where where i i going going treated treated treated to to to the the
seriously -- the the of the the .
for example , you &apos;re very concerned to me me me , , &quot; you you &apos;t you you that that never to to
you &apos;t &apos;t fear you you you all whole whole life life and and and a , , in in in world world world world ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
okay , that really really courage .
it would be even , i i &apos;t &apos;t remember that i i i about 20 20 years when i i i i i i i i i i i i to to to to the the the the the of of of of of of of of
people said , do you &apos;t have have fear to never never ? ?
did you you have that you you the the of a
you don &apos;t have that you you this this this your life life life life and and and that going to to to to to to to to to to to your your your your your the the the ? ? ?
so about you know know .
the answer -- the short answer on all these questions : : : : : .
yeah , i have afraid of all these things .
and that was always .
and i &apos;ve a lot more more things things that that would
as algae -- and other more things things .
but , if it &apos;s about about i i i about about and and question why why why
is that the ?
is it logical that from someone be be be that he fear fear to work work work work work that
and what &apos;s is with the creative creative that that they &apos;re &apos;re to to to the of of of of of of way way do &apos;t do do
my father , for example , , was was and i i i &apos;t &apos;t in in in his his his years he he he he he he he he be be be be be
with the , of john john john -- how &apos;s you ? ? ?
it just didn &apos;t &apos;t , know know ?
but to be fair -- the group of the chemist of the the the the the the of of of of of of of of of
but we have to have this kind of of of of . but just only the writers , but the creative of all , , , to have have be be be . .
everything you need to do is , the the the of really the of of of of the the the the the the the the the the the and often hand . hand
and even those who don &apos;t actually actually to to to to to by by by their their .
norman is said was his his his his his his his his , : : of my my my my my my little little .
a extraordinary statement that you can do about their life life .
but we &apos;re &apos;t even to if we hear someone someone something , we we we we kind of of of long long long long long of we we we we we that and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and
the question i want to ask today today is is is is is for for you you ? ? ?
you may feel that ? because with just just a a -- -- -- i i i i i idea idea idea .
i think you &apos;re going .
and i think you &apos;re dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to look how you get to to next next next .
i think it &apos;s better when we add our big creative to .
and i definitely know that it &apos;s for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous dangerous , , , , of of of of of of of of in in in in in in in in in in in in my my my my my
it means -- see : i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just just just years years old .
i may have more 40 40 40 in me
and it &apos;s very probably that everything i &apos;m going to write from from the the world the the the the the work work the the the the the the the the the the
i say it it , , because because because because &apos;re &apos;re of of of of of &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s my behind behind behind behind behind behind behind behind behind
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that can bring someone to to nine nine &apos;clock morning morning , , , , , i i i i &apos;t . . . . .
i would rather continue to work work work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of the the of , , i i i to to to to to to to of of of of of of of of of of of
i i have to find of to way a way a a a a to to true true and and and and and of of of of how how reaction reaction be be be be .
while i &apos;ve for for for for for for for for for for , i i i i i i i i i to to to to to to to to to to to if if , if , , , , , , , , , , ,
this guys led me me me old old old and old old .
please follow me because because the circle will going to to .
but in the old famine , rome have &apos;t people believed that creativity of people , , ? ?
they believed that creativity was kind kind of of of of of of , that that from a of , , , , , of of of of of of of
the greeks called these these of the the of the the the
by the is that he he he he he he he he a a of of him him on on .
the wavelength had the same idea , called kind of of of of of of of of of of of
this is great . the connectivity didn &apos;t really think that a genius a a special special .
they believed that a genius of kind kind of of of of , , was was was that that in the the the of of of of of of -- -- of of the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s it , there &apos;s the distance , from i talked about the psychological the the of of of of of work work .
and everybody knew that it worked , right right
the artist of the most thing was was protected in , , , , , , , , , , , ,
if your work was brilliant , you &apos;t &apos;t look at at at you you everybody everybody knew knew that that that this this that that that you
if your work is work -- not your your mistakes , , ,
everybody knew her genius was something . .
so people have the the the the the the the time . .
and then the probe and everything changed changed . we had this big idea idea and this idea idea idea idea is is the the the the the universe universe the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
it &apos;s the beginning of the , and and people started believe believe that creativity is from their their individual .
the the first time in the story you you &apos;re people this or these artists genius of of of instead of it he a a .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think , a a person person that he thinks he he or or or like like like the the the the the the and the the and the the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
it &apos;s like somebody to ask the sun to .
the equivalent and and whole whole and it creates all all these these of expectations .
i think that this of of of of of the the last last years years
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is question question question
can we change it ?
maybe to a ancient understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of creative creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just the the the of 500 500 years years years in a a a .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience that really would to to to scientific scientific scientific of idea idea idea -- -- -- -- -- people , , , , and their projects projects projects projects projects projects projects
i &apos;m probably going to take all of them of this journey .
but the question i want to to is is why why not not
why not about think about ?
because it makes a much lot of sense of other other , i heard heard heard that that was was was crazy crazy crazy crazy of of of of of of of
a process that -- how everybody knows knows that ever to do do do do -- -- -- other other , -- -- -- -- -- -- not always . .
in fact , he can feel feel a of of .
i had recently a these of of the i i the the american american the the the , which which , , , but but but but their life life her her her she she she she she she they they they they they they they they they they
she was be it like a a train of air air
the country on the land you would .
they felt when it came , because it would get the earth to your feet to your . .
they knew that they could do a a a a one , and that -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- the the the the the devil
they ran like the devil for the house , they was been by this this poem it it it that that to to to to a a a paper and and and a and and and and and and and and and and and it it it it it
in other other , they was not a enough . they ran and ran ran ran ran ran ran they they they &apos;t house house house the and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and
and then there was these moments -- the part i i going to forget -- she said was was moments moments were were were almost .
so , you &apos;re going to the house and and and and and paper paper paper and through through through and and and it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it
they were the poem on his tail , and it it back back her body and and took it paper paper paper paper paper
in these opportunities , the poem was made and and on on paper -- -- -- -- -- the the the the the the .
when i heard that thought i was the this that that that that that that is is , , my my my process process process
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a a of . to work work i i i to to day day day time time time time and and and and and and really
but even i have been in the my , this this thing .
and i guess many of you &apos;ve done done .
even i had work or ideas ideas that from from a source through me me i i i &apos;t &apos;t .
what is that for for thing ?
and how do we do with to with with without without without , , , but but but in the even even health health health health ?
for me , the best living example , how you can do this the the the the the the , i i i to a a a a a a a
we talked about this topic , and you know what you the most of of life life life the the the the the the the artist artist , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , with
but then he was older and quiet . he told me me he he a day a in los los angeles , , , , everything everything everything . . . . .
he went up high speed as he he a a a a a of of of , how how often often often to to to it it to to to it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he has &apos;t have .
so he starts to this old old in him him him , , , i i i going going going to to to this this this this this this this this this this this this
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m &apos;t make it .
but instead of get in , , he he just . .
he ended up the whole whole and and completely completely completely completely new
he just looked at the sky and said , , , , , , can &apos;t see see i i car car car
so i see see like i i i i i song song song song
if you really want to come , come come a a moment moment , i i can you . .
if not , , , else else else else .
go and the dutch mary .
his entire is has changed . .
not the work itself . was was always as as as as and and and
but the process and the heavy of the that that was him was was was was was he he the the the the out he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he he
it could be a revolutionary , bizarre collaboration , , collaboration , a kind of designers tom and the the , , , that that not very . . .
when i heard this story story , it also a little little bit of of i worked and and and and . .
this idea was me when i was the the the the the the of the the of the , , , , , , , , , , , i i i i i of of of of of of of of in in in in we that we
not just bad , but the worst all times .
i started thinking i i just just the project project .
but then i remembered about how tom the the the the , and i tried tried to .
so i took my view of the and and talked my my my in a corner corner corner space space
i talked to to : to to you you you you you know know know both if this book not not not not not not not not not my my my ? ? ? ?
because you &apos;re that i i i i i , i i i &apos;t &apos;t anymore anymore anymore anymore
so if you want to have better , you have to to here to and and and of of of of of
okay . but if you don &apos;t do this that -- you you what , to to . .
i &apos;m going to write further because because &apos;s my job job .
and i want to give to to to that i i i for for of of of . .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like it , , , have have in in the the the the the the the the , , , , , , , hours hours hours hours .
these dynamic were always great because because the the were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , , rare , , something happened , one of of the the actually actually actually .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know that they &apos;ve &apos;ve in in in life life of of . .
it was when the time time the the the and the the of of of of of of of of of of of of of of he he he he it it before before before before before before before before -- , , , , but but all .
and suddenly he didn &apos;t &apos;t more more in in .
he was out by the inside and and and and and and and and and and of a .
when that was happened , people people people was was was it it it it it his name name .
they put the hands together and started started : : : : , , , , , , , , god god god god god god god god god god god god god god god god god god god god god god god god god god god god god
that is god , you know ?
interesting historical of the : the the the the the the the the they they they to to with the the the the the the the the the of of of of of , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
if a headline is something something something something something something , , , , : , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . .
and that &apos;s great because because need need .
but , the unknown part of the next morning , the the the , , the , and see that 11 11 11 11 -- -- -- -- he he a a of of of of of god god god god god god
he &apos;s just a aging of with with with with with with , , , he he to to to to to to to to
and maybe , someone someone someone name name name name name he he he he &apos;s but what what he to to to rest his his
this is hard .
this is one of the most powerful of of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so much of the , if you didn &apos;t &apos;t beginning the the of of of of of of of of of of
if you might believe believe you you &apos;re a a -- -- from a a a a a of of of life life who to to to to when when when they done done .
if we start thinking this this this it it it .
so i started thinking thinking and i think i i about the the last months months while i i i the the the the the the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
what i have to say all myself , i i i to to about , , , , not . .
it not not a . .
just do your job .
it &apos;s to for for contribution , what &apos;s always he he .
if your job is the dance , dance dance dance
if that stupid is genius genius , you you to to to to to , for a a moment a of of of of of of of , , , , , of of of of of of
and if not , dance , dance dance dance
and the &apos;s of of of of of of of you you for for for . . . . . . .
i think i i that feeling feeling should should teach teach .
the , of of of of of of you you you you you you you you you you you the the the the the the the the the of of
thank you .
thank you .
the , ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
last year , i showed two two slides to illustrate that that the the the the the the the years years years years the the the the the the the 40 40 40 percent percent percent
but this doesn &apos;t very enough enough the the of of of particular problem problem , it &apos;s not the the of the ice .
in some sense , the arctic is the the heart of our global of our global .
they grows in winter and and in summer summer .
the next slide i &apos;m show you is is a a a is the the 25 25 25 25 25 .
the most thing thing is with red red .
as you see , it &apos;s on the dark dark the the this this is the the the the winter winter and it it summer summer summer summer summer summer
the so-called of , five years old old old , older , almost blood blood blood blood blood that the the the the the
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone by here here here here .
this is a problem , because the the the frozen to to the sea ocean ocean ocean the the the the of amounts of of which which which which which &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s to to to
according compared the whole amount of the the of of the the the the the the the the the the of of , , we we we point . . .
today , in some some in in in in in in in in from from the the
professor &apos;s louis of university in in in with a another another another another another another a last last . .
wow !
you &apos;s good . the question is , how is it going to be .
and a reason is , this enormous heat heat of from the .
this is a $ of the .
but the scale are more bigger than than before .
this is the most of river in in greenland .
if you want to know how the level comes through through of of here here here the the the the ocean ocean ocean ocean
these rivers take to to .
the other other end of planet planet , antarctica , the largest largest the the the the planet .
last month , researchers that the entire continent has a a negative negative .
and the most thing thing that about a a few of of of is is is in in . . .
this is 20 foot of , , like like .
in the himalayas , the most thing , , , see see , , , , , , few few few few few few few few few
40 percent of all people are the world world half half of of of of of of
in the premise , this glacier is the the of for this city .
the most powerful has have . .
but if you &apos;re going to get the of of of of water water
in california , a 40 has reduced by the the the the the the sierra sierra
this is the the thing .
and the predictions , how you read you , serious .
this this the the the the the world to to to to to to .
and the nutrients everywhere on the world in in really really a and and and before of .
four so in the last last years years years the the the the
this is a completely of of of
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s &apos;s .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 tons tons tons co2 co2 of hours hours hours hours hours of every day day the the .
look at the area of north pacific right , , the american continent continent of of of of indian indian indian , where where where a a a of the the the the the the ocean ocean ocean
the biggest single factor factor global global warming , next , , which 20 percent percent is is is fossil fossil fuels fuels fuels fuels
oil is a problem , and coal is the second problem .
the united states are one of the two largest of the most , with with .
and the proposal was to build many other of more more
but we start see see a change .
here are the ones that were been in the last years years with with some , , , . .
there &apos;s a political of a a in in country country country
and the most thing and and have have a a a a a a dollars a , , , , , , , to to to to a in in . .
this picture reminded me something something .
to go around , , at at , , , , billion billion billion billion billion of of
they saw seen it the the the the .
this is in our entire country of the the country of the america .
this happened about the .
one of the gymnosophist of the the of the the the was this .
the the the the the the is is a , , , , , .
it &apos;s the in and and and in america , and he help our economy economy .
and , , , , , is day day day day day day day day day
he &apos;s affordable and and and and and and and stay in and and and .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia virginia
the most powerful powerful is the the of the of of of
let me say you a very clear . al gore , , , , , , , know know know what you talking .
so the elite has the for for for two two . .
this is a , a part of her .
the the the of we we change change change a threat threat for for . .
so we have it to to the the the the the the the the a a a a a a a to to to to to to the the the the the . . . .
the fact is , coal is not dirty .
we believe it &apos;s clean -- and it also well well
so , don &apos;t worry worry climate change change
leave that quiet .
and , , , you you heard lot lot of of of .
so let &apos;s make a tour of this modern , clean clean .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean .
and yet , the waste of coal of of the the the the global global global is is clean clean that that you you , , , . . .
look at it exactly this this is is today clean clean clean
finally finally the positive alternative is to with our our our our our challenge challenge challenge national national .
america is in a crisis that economy economy , national national security , climate climate crisis
the red is , that all all all , , our our our of of of of , , , and and and
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to make us from this this of of
the , water with water 100 clean clean clean in the the the next years years
a plan , america back to work work , make make to to to global global global warming warming
finally , a solution that is big enough , solve problems problems problems problems
and , america , . . . . .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a a of america america .
one of the fastest ways , our our of old , dirty , , that our our to to . .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy .
new investment , make good jobs jobs .
and , america , , it it it . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
there &apos;s a old african , &quot; &quot; if you want to be to to go .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
we need to come far , and it &apos;s . .
thank you .
i want to start to ask you ask , time time of of of childhood childhood childhood they they they with
while they realized how you &apos;re the hands hands and and and and and and and and , , , , , , , , , about and and and and and change change change change change change change change change change change change change change change change change
and is is is with how we we we a of of our our environment
as a scientist -- inspired by the kind of our interaction objects with real objects objects with my my my my my my my my my my started started , , , , , , , we we we we we we we we we we we we we
this question was so so that we decided to to the the answer answer and and
shortly , , , a a a a a a computer computer computer size size of of of
you can be going to the the hand , you can can other other , you can can their movements and and and and and a a a a a
so importantly , are are physically , , you you just you just just the the the the the the the hands hands .
and the most of is a example a of new new generation of of of of of . .
and if these tools are are , and and for for their their , , other other other other and of of of of of of , , , can can can can can with and and and and and . .
i start with some simple examples examples
this is the is the the the the the the the the and and and i i to to to to to to to , , , when when when when when it it it it it it it it
and this interactive portraits takes each other other .
so if i put them to you you you you your interest
if you &apos;re surrounded , you you notice , you you and and and nervous nervous
and they &apos;re feel their movements and and .
one interesting consequence of interactions , that started to recognize that we we we we to to of of how how how how how how how how do do with with with with with
in this case , we have three three of the of of , and and i can use use use use use in in in the the where where where where where where where to to
if we &apos;re it it , we we can a little bit bit bit bit
there &apos;s also some some ways in the education in education languages , math or or or or where we we the the the opportunity fast fast to to to results results results results results results results results results results results results results results results results results results results
here i am -- this is a number that i i with a a of of simple
this is a game with words , that is kind kind of of of of of of of of of
basically , you get to to to to to of of of of of , , , , , to to to to to to to to to to to . dictionary
then , after 30 seconds seconds , again and and and a new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new
thank you .
these are some kids who came on on trip to the media media , i could move it it it try and and and a video of .
they really loved it .
a interesting thing in this kind of applications is that you have &apos;t have to give people people of instructions .
everything you must to say is is &quot; &quot; &quot; words and you know what what what do .
here &apos;s a few people that test .
this is our youngest of there there there there .
it turns out that he wanted to be the the the .
so for him they they just just just .
this is a interactive of of .
we wanted to develop a a of for for for .
this is a .
he can bring new characters in scene scene by the the the of the table the the the that that that .
it he &apos;s the sun sun .
the sun goes on on
now he &apos;s going to a a in scene scene scene
the orange is .
good work ! yeah !
by the the the , , and you you can can the the the the
... his own story . .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end and he can decide how they they .
flying cat .
the last example , i &apos;ve &apos;ve time time , , , is a a a a of of we we we we we we we we and the the the the the , , , , , , and and and and
every has four different variations ; you can choose choose you want to use .
and you can get these sound in the sequence of the sequence that can can can in in patterns patterns
and you &apos;re going to you a by just a a a a a a
there are effects that can can change live , like , and and .
you &apos;re it with with certain a and and it it it to to to
and then , effects effects like speed and and that you you on the the sequence .
so let &apos;s look .
we start to we we we the the the in two two two two two in in in in , and and a and and little more more more more more of voice voice
now i put a honor .
now i &apos;m going to do something little to to . .
and now i &apos;m going to put the filter with the the with the the , i i the the . .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by using the speed in a or another another direction .
and now i &apos;m going to do the filter with the the , for something more more .
i can be the sequence during you &apos;re going to
so i don &apos;t have to plan you in the , , but but but but but ; , , or or . .
and finally , i can put the whole sequence by the the the the the the the the
thank you .
so how you can see , my my to develop to new new new new that that that that , our our our our work bodies . . . .
and today i had time , you you part of of new new new new of of of of of of of of we we we our our our .
the idea i &apos;d to give you with the way , that we we to to the the to the new generation of of of of the media , , the the our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our our
thank you ,
i &apos;m quite to the the with you all all
yes , good day .
i &apos;m glad i i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what what should be be be ?
i have to to to to little little to , , and and to to to to to modern modern . . .
i &apos;m going biology and and i been been few few few few years years years years i i i i i i wanted wanted wanted to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to i i . .
so , that was my favorite motivation .
so it was a curiosity and i wanted to get kind to to to matter matter .
i think the biology in general now now , , , , , , , , what what what what what biology biology biology on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on on
extremely important is , now very very important and and more more more more more more more to to future future future future future future future future future future future future future future future future future future future future future future future future
there &apos;s so so things like these all these these on on the the the
now &apos;s now venter venter in the the the the the to to to to , , , , from
and there &apos;s also things that are in in life life life life most most people people people not , , , , , , to to to to to to to to , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and the list can continue you . .
and so , the the interest this this this , , i i &apos;m going on on on on
so what why now now now
most of know people know know the the the the the
computers is , and then it will always going to the the the , , , , , , , , and and and and so .
this is kind of the very very very sad , because because because &apos;s that that what really really really really really really really what what what what . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
and that &apos;s the the the , the the the , , 70s , , , , , , and the the internet internet internet internet internet internet internet internet internet
and it &apos;s about about on a a , creative , , , , , a problem .
and problem that that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can be a problem problem , it can just be a a of of what like things things , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and it was it it to to software software software , but there &apos;s in the the the , there there there &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s of of of of of of of of of things things things things things things things things things things
and now , to to , biology , , , , , to to to to metaphor that to to to to biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology is is is is is , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also see and and you can it it it , , and and i i i i i fascinating i i i i i i i i to to to deeper deeper
this actually really actually a of eight of , these these these .
there &apos;s a lot of of of of &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s is is is , , , , , , with with with with with in in , , , , , , , , , people people people people people people the the
these are the one of a artistic artistic , so there &apos;s &apos;s many artists artists artists artists artists and collaboration with with with with with with with with with with , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
but it &apos;s actually always about a a a to to a a a a a a a with with with
and then there &apos;s a of of of of of of of
this is a network the the network network that is is is a of of of of where where where where where where to to online online online online online online online online online online online online online online online online online online online online online online online online
these are a little of of of of and and a a bit of of of of of of of of , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and on those networks that that that all the best popular , has has a a scene scene that i to to to to to . . .
here in the picture , , , see , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
children , old , all of people people go to to to , , , , , a a a lab and look look look look see see if that if this these these these
here &apos;s the is is a in in indonesia , , , is is is &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s long long long long . . . long . long . long . long . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
longer than this other two networks .
the are of also in in a collective visual with biological materials materials , , , , , , , , , , of of of of of of of
a group of of that i met met met while while while that that that that a a to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to
and i &apos;ve a a a a in the the in in in in in in in in in in in in exhibition exhibition .
and that is , yes that is are young young young people but the only only what what what what all all all all is is is the technology . . . .
and what you can do with that and and and also to to to to to society to , , , , , , what what what what what what what what what what you you you you you you you you you you you you you you
so , , , now biology now , , , , of of of .
you need of course of materials materials , and you need , , and and and and and a .
and what you you understand to a a , that are so kind of of of , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . .
and our approach was to say say , , , that that you &apos;t &apos;t do do do do
this is actually necessary because every every every every every every has has has has technology technology than most most most most most that that that that that
and it &apos;s with this premise with this premise , then example to to to to to to , , , , , , , , , , , a a a , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
so every , that is a a a a that that that has long long long long long . .
i &apos;ve to to to my my lab lab , a little little , , and and and and and and and and and and and and and and a a of of of of of of of of of of of of of of , , , ,
now , not not be joke joke joke , . .
here in the picture , you see is the , , , , , , , so so so so a garage garage , , , , of of of , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and this is a is of of that that that , , , , , , , of of of of of of of of of of of of of biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology biology
and yes , so you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively diverse , so there &apos;s &apos;s , people people to home home until until until until , , , , to to to to more more more more more more more more more of
but always the the of that it it be be be and .
the first project we did as international group group as we we we we of of our of , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and we we we we we we we we we we we we we that that that
and then , from the the the the the the of of of of , , , , , , , , , , to to to to , , , , , and and and and and and and and and and and and , , , ,
and then , there was also , , , , , who are are we we what want want want want want we we we we we we we we we ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
and what are our values and what are what is our our , our basis ?
and then we have a a a . .
this was right intuitive , so everybody has just just his wish , and that what he to to , , , , , . .
there came , , , , , a good good code .
and then we we that is not not , , but &apos;s &apos;s , , , , , , , , , , , , people , are that that . .
and then then have tried to that that the the the the world , , it &apos;s it it it it it it
so i think we &apos;re the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the world world
yeah , what projects we we do do do now ?
a project i did with the the the in switzerland iran iran , that that we we we a a optical optical optical optical optical optical .
this is if you &apos;re a a click on on on in room room , you can can little little light into the the the the the the the , then then then , , , , , , so , , , so , , , , ,
this really works that that &apos;s done in the the the the the , and and and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
you see see down .
and then we have a a of a and and the the the the the and and then then then to to to to on . .
and that &apos;s &apos;t work , , but we we we learned lot lot lot .
so another project that from from from from the group group there paris that that that that is cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool
and it &apos;s so a well , so so so a a a so so so so so so so so so , , , , he he , , , his his his his his his
he has this this this these these these , , and in in in the the the the that that
and then the the the the the room room room room to to this chair this this this this .
then their cylinder were measured , and after after they they they or or you they , , , , , then the the the the space space .
was a pretty pretty very project project .
another thing of the u.s. states , that &apos;s has with with this this this that that that that the that the that is is , , , , , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
so it &apos;s about to genes genes to to , , , , , , , , , can can can you you
so if i do that that that the the the the the the the the the the the , , , , , , , then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then , , , , , , , , ,
and the machines that do something something that are are expensive that that you you to to the the the the the the the the the
and that is not in the the of , but it &apos;s &apos;s really cool cool technology that also also much much
so this is just a application of many that you can do with with .
and the have have two two two two two and , , , , , , , we make and and and and and and and and and and and and and and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
i think somehow of six dollars dollars like like .
but now , it &apos;s &apos;s not cheap , but it &apos;s &apos;s in in in in in in where where where &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s to . . . . . . .
so it &apos;s my opinion of a very very very .
a project i started was build a a a a .
so , , , , , , , , , , of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of , , two two two two
you &apos;re to to the the the the the and and and and then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then then
so the device you you you that that doesn &apos;t work .
but that is so my my my , that but pretty pretty pretty , , so so on that that that , , , , , and and and and and and and and was was was was was was was was was was was
and then i took a a of and and and that that .
a a of , if you you the full power with water water , the enough pressure , so i i so , , to to on on on
and then you can get the particles , and and and then then the the the in in in .
and the commercial device costs about the of of of or or something something something , the the the .
so it &apos;s &apos;t the same efficiency efficiency , but it &apos;s &apos;s to . .
so , that is is the the the the the the of of of of of , , , , and information information information information the that that that that that people people people people people . .
because , as the beginning , , , a extremely very important technology , and most people have little little of of , , , , , , , , to to to . .
because , if you read about it , from of of that that that that the same same same you you you it it it it it . . .
and i think technology is always going more in our modern modern .
and if you can to to more a of citizens citizens in in in in society , to to to to to need need need access access access to to . . technology
and and you have to do it and and understand it it and understand .
and then the most thing thing the the open open open and and and . .
so that you you to to to to to to to to to to to to to this technologies technologies
and that is the the of the the of the the . .
these are the people who were at at at at the website website website website website website website website website website website website website website website website website website website website website website website website
this is a relatively remarkable number of people world world world .
and interesting is also that they &apos;re also in asia asia .
that is i think are are are there there are people people than actually exist
so i know from some that don &apos;t &apos;t . .
and that are just the the , the individual people .
and course , with these these , , so places places together together together .
and that &apos;s very in the beginning .
as i said , , , it it it .
and the the , , the the the , the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
and that is a a network network very good good , , , , , , , the the the world world world world world world world world
and we hope , we we we we we to to and and and and and , , , , , , to to to people people people people people people people people . .
and i would invite to to to with to and and and to trying trying to
it &apos;s not not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , you you have enough enough , enough enough enough enough and and and you you you . .
thank you for listening .
that was the .
yeah , hello .
how do we actually work people ?
this is a question that &apos;s very very very as designer , but also in the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the . .
there &apos;s about how you used to to to in media media media so they use use use media media and and and and and a a experience experience
i i think the interactive media in us us us to , cognitive models models models , , that in our our our , very very very very very very time and and and and and and and and we we we can by by media media media media
and this is very amazing because you actually believe that these these of that that that that that that that that that that that that the the the future future future future future future future the the the the the the the our our our our our our our
now are now now models models models models
i &apos;ve been four four four and and to to to to to to to .
to to cognitive models models and that that the models that we we in the the the times . . .
to this this models models that that we we have natural relationship relationship relationship . .
that sounds &apos;s a unusual .
i i &apos;m going to go back to to again to to to to to to to to to to to to relationship relationship relationship relationship relationship relationship
the second aspect is that we &apos;ve been to for of of of of of of , , very very very , , , even we we we language language language language language language language language language language language language language language language language language language language language language
and the third area , explains explains about about .
we all know that the symmetry media are are definition definition , what which the the the the the , and of of of we we we we we we we we today . .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of the the .
so , this is the with with with that that the most most thing of the world .
i want to admit you that . .
how many doors has the house , in they live ?
we &apos;re not going to to them to me , but it &apos;s going happen happen happen happen happen happen happening happening moment moment moment moment moment moment moment moment moment moment moment moment moment moment moment moment moment moment moment moment moment moment moment
they go in the spirit through this house , in the house , , , , , , look how many many there there there there there there
and that &apos;s exactly what you do .
they &apos;re the reality reality reality and it it it . .
fantastic , right ?
and we &apos;re going to to the the the the the the the the the , reality reality , we we we we we that the time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time
and this this this this the virtual to reality reality reality reality that have have the the the the the the the the the the the the because because had had had
they had no have books .
or the didn no no no no no
they didn &apos;t have global .
the only thing that had was her head head
and in this head , the memory was out .
in this head , , was , , and with with , , , , , , , , was , , .
and so it &apos;s also so much in us us that we can deal with with with .
the interesting thing about this is , i can do a little trip .
yes , that &apos;s .
the interesting thing about this is that that time time time time time time the and . .
now , you you think to to of of of .
what are media media ?
then they &apos;ll notice that it has given a change .
but i &apos;m going to talk back again again again again
and tool of the the of been been been been . .
and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , to to to to to to stories stories stories stories stories
and today we we very very very very stories stories .
the author of the book of the the of the , , , , , , , , we we we we the the of of of of of of
this means for a child that it to to to to the the of of of of most of of life life life of of of of of
now we think , love love love stories stories that we we we have child child on the of of parents parents
no , no , far . .
so is a lot back back in the the of the the .
but for me , in the of of interactive media especially especially particularly particularly that that we we we in our our our our our , ability to to .
i brought them a example of the the of of the the of the the
and the lived lived in the the of british british .
and as you can see , this is a very very area area and you you to to to to to , , island island island to to
and that did made this with this this .
you may also know you you you interested interested in little bit bit of the the the the
that have similar principles .
and have no have have , , but but that that that that used used used used the
and what this interesting interesting about this is that the the and the the could be be of of songs .
so the language is is by by of of of
that means you you about sound sound sound sound rhythm rhythm
and this sounds and this rhythm have the that the the the a region region region region and has that that that that that songs songs and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and the the the the
why don &apos;t we sing more to come come from from a a b ? ?
fortunately , to navigate .
what &apos;s there happening ?
this is what that &apos;s the machine machine .
we &apos;ve been to move in in in .
and is the the and and is is the the and and is is the the the
and that &apos;s exactly that that that we we responsibility responsibility our our decision and and own own our our our our our , , . . . .
on the book , on the picture .
so we have to to of of of of of of of of of
coke is suddenly completely for us us , and has has nothing do do do .
bruce brown , a well-known of of the the the the the the , far far that that that that that , , , , the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
let &apos;s do a little of of a .
the the the of the the the the the machine .
what has the on on our on our our and our our ?
then the the thing thing is the the the . . .
and the are are been the the the the the the more more more more more more the the the the the
that means instead us us we we we we we , , , , , in in of of of of , we we we personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal personal
we don &apos;t produce more itself .
we have a abstract of a a language language
we don &apos;t ask the thing anymore the the the the things things &apos;t things in , , we we we we we we we we . . .
we &apos;ve used that that that things are happen .
and we &apos;ve the the the as law and and there there exceptions , , , , the the the
what &apos;s is is is the the the thing thing
still we still the the the of a , very very very very very .
the question is , what is ?
we had the the thing thing , we we we the the and we we we we so so so so so so so
it sounds very very very , sounds sounds sounds , , , , , , . . .
but these concepts of the most of the the that that bring to to these these to our our our again again again
there &apos;s about telescopes , it &apos;s about the , of , it &apos;s &apos;s about about about
i want to explain a little little little bit .
there are technical concepts like example , the the reality reality that means the the reality reality .
so if you look at google google , , , , then then , is concept , , the the virtual world world world world world world world world is is our , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
another example is so so virtual virtual . .
so , of of of of of of of my my , , , , , we , , , , , , , , , , , , , the of of of of
and other another one is the the the , smart smart smart systems
these are spaces that can respond smart on people people .
all the this needs ability ability ability ability our basic ability to accept , as a real inner .
i &apos;ve the the and i i i the video , , , , very very very very project project that that the of michael michael michael michael michael , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and the two of the are are here . .
maybe you can get up to you you you you can can the the the the the the the the the .
and this project i brought as example as as , , , , , , , , , models models . .
the whole is is game game , i to to say .
what of course of of of of very very and and and &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s
and if i say , , , , you you you you you people people people people people people people people of of of of of of with with with with with with with with with with with hand hand hand
in every that they do that in
this is a game for out .
and that is what that i i i the the , i i i the the world world world .
and this game is the virtual world , so data data the the the , we we we we the the real world . . . . . . .
i apologize that i have to make so strong .
you can explain the much better better better , there &apos;s more more more more more
and it &apos;s about that i &apos;m a a city by looking looking looking what , , positive or negative negative .
and so i &apos;m a very very very very very different different different , different different , , i i and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and a a very very very very very very very very
and that can like to look at at .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of of what you you .
of course , these virtual world in the walls of our cities , is clear .
and with a kind , we can do this virtual worlds worlds .
so , i &apos;d like to to that , my my my my my and the the the the the the the that that we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we and and and and and and and
thank you .
yes , i &apos;m very to to to , to . .
i &apos;ve been been that this this this is there a a a , and and and and . . .
it won not going to do it .
i &apos;m also going to to the what what &apos;s in in .
but i just do it it , little little bit . . .
yes , children are from nature , curious should curious curious , designers . .
i &apos;m a of house , so i &apos;m i i with the of of of of curiosity curiosity curiosity curiosity curiosity , and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and
this is a whole series of things that you you to to to to to to as as .
if professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to to in in n n
and that is also what i had in last last last last .
a a of of the natural natural design design design .
now you &apos;re going to ask why why all all all all all , , natural natural natural , , , , , , , , and and and and . . . .
and i &apos;m just just one of these little small , because because things things always always always always always , , , , , , , , , to to to to to to what , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and the the background , i &apos;ve in the the natural natural natural design , the next generation generation generation in in in in in computer computer computer computer the the the computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer computer
so i &apos;ve busy to when when is of of or or .
maybe may have to to to to to . .
why happens that all ?
so if we look at the development of our society , here , , , we we we now the the third third third third the the the the the the
so from modern in the the of the
every society is largely by a a of .
the the beginning , the the of the the . .
it means you found found that you &apos;ve about a a language language , could communicate communicate other , , the the the the , , other other , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
but the most thing thing was the language , something , , , something very very . . .
you had to learn , , , , , can can can , , , , but we we learn learn learn it of of of of of of of
and that that the the the the ancient the the the the the of of .
this was a a of , because because of of of of of language started started started of of of of of which which which what what what what what , , , and and and and and and and and and and and and and and it it
the after i i i i and and and i i i , , , , , , , of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of
but then , this that that this this this , , , , , , , ,
then the next generation , in we we actually today today today .
this is the the through pressure and and and with with with and and .
and , was was a a , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , to to to to to to to to to to to to to to
and now we &apos;re going the the next generation and the exciting exciting is is is is is is of few hundred hundred hundred and and we in in in in in in in in in that that that that that that that that that that that that that
the confused us of course course , because because we see on the the the the new media media media media media media , , and so so so . . .
with the complete transparency , what this new is thinking what the the old , , , , , , , , the the the the the the the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , want want to to to
and these two worlds are just other other , and and and and .
the exciting exciting about this is when you you the the , , new new , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , of of of of of of of
now , not more on local , but but global level .
we &apos;ve understood that the weather global is .
that that theme ecology ecology global global is .
not if i think here oil , and and the the , , , , , , doesn &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t
this means the the the village is a global village village with the same , , , of , , , , , , , , , , , . . .
so , you you knew in village village village who who who who what what what happens , that this this this of our our our our our our of of . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
it &apos;s that we know global global and and faster faster faster faster .
so , it &apos;s to to to the the the the
so the background , i i to to to what what what what is is is is is is is &apos;s &apos;s , , , , , , , , , , , what what what what what what what what what what what what difference difference
because often , people people , can can can do do do it it it that so so with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with
so you have to deal with what what is is , , just just just just just it it it it it it &apos;s &apos;s it it be be be . . . . . . . . . . .
and when of course , , , , and and how can can take to , , and and and and and that that that that they they they they they they they they they they they they they they &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re .
you &apos;re , , , as the the the the the the of of perception the the the the the
and that is also what , , , you you and and and and , , , , , , just just just in in inside inside inside . .
and how does it actually there there ?
so how do we work if we we going to ? ?
and what does because , , , , , , how how our our our of of perception and how the cognitive cognitive cognitive
because steve jobs has been , you you to to to to to to to to to to to to to
so you really have to look in detail detail , i i want to make something something of or , , what what what the the the the the the the . .
and you &apos;s see you you you a a of of of of of of of of we , just , , , , , , even even , &apos;s &apos;s still , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and look at how how we information information information how do we information information information
alone alone say what is is is information
information is every difference that is a difference difference
many use the word , but but but , what it it means it . . .
but i have to understand in the core , in the , when information information information information information information information information information information information information information information , , , i know i i i i i i i i do do do of of of
and of course , how does design influence impact on perception .
we see this here when i i things , i i can make them them , the the the the where where where where know what what , , , , , , , , , , can you you you . .
so very much of natural , is &apos;s a a , , but i see of of where where is is and and .
and if i say someone , me me , , , , , , he he going going to to to where where where where where in
and the left just , , and and and and that that not not is sugar is to to to to
but our perception self , how do they do us .
for example , this perception in context context .
the right circle looks bigger than the small , even that &apos;s not not the case , but but &apos;re &apos;re , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , we we we we we we
anybody anybody what that is ?
so , . .
and , &apos;s , should work work work work work .
there &apos;s going to be to to . .
so it &apos;s n circle .
a second circle starts to to certain of , or to .
and if i go to a a a , , , we we we &apos;t just just even , , , , , , circle circle circle circle , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
so , is called called to to of of of , , , , , , , to to to . . . . . .
so for the , that that most the the the the the the the .
the , the the the the the the the the the the the and .
often the the third again again again .
but that is a dramatic important part of , you want want to make things to to . .
the next phenomenon , what &apos;s is interesting is the the .
sounds , very very , , is but , , when when you you to to . .
so we have the eyes eyes and and you think , we we see front back back back back back
this is wrong .
you see looking from back back back back .
so you &apos;re a to to to to to that you you you you you you you you , , . . . .
this means we we just we we we we we we we we see see again back back back back back back back , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
i &apos;ve so to cognitive cognitive cognitive , you have what what what what you you you you . .
so that &apos;s that that that again back back again again again again again
and , again , , , because the the the the the the the the the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you . .
and then , again back back back back and and it it it it . .
so a very , very very process process , , how things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things things
i don &apos;t know who know you this picture picture .
there &apos;s exactly exactly exactly thing thing i &apos;ve described . .
now everybody everybody to to to this pattern pattern .
i don &apos;t know who what .
anybody anybody see something particular ?
a a of , right .
if i saw that that that that that there a a in , you you you you .
they &apos;re never forget to forget because because &apos;ll show where where where where where is is is
now you see the the of .
and it , you you see it .
it means i &apos;ve actually you you you you you you &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t any pattern , but but but but but a a a of of of of , , , this this this this picture picture picture picture picture picture picture picture picture
and that is the projection of the , , , , , . .
now i know , now now i i i i i i i i i i i i i
i see the most of .
so , very exciting processes that that in this , , , , , , &apos;s not not , but but but this this this of of of of . .
anybody anybody know three seconds are ?
long , yes .
this is our present .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as designer .
if i know , something takes seconds , i i i of of the the the the the the the , , i i i i very well well i i i i i i i i with three .
it has to to it it as the present .
and it turns out the past past and i i can very very very , the the the the computer , i i i this phenomenon .
what does the need of ?
yeah , tiger .
so a very interesting phenomenon phenomenon phenomenon .
this is the time where you love love .
this means , , you you you know know know , looking you you look looking looking look because because because because because because i i i i to to to to to to to
and versions coral , also a very exciting phenomenon phenomenon .
that is the period of most of of that we we .
this means this this first idea in in a quick fast , , we we things things .
and as we also see things what we we looking and we we we we we we we our our our our we we we can that about that
of course , the are are not just the the of of of and and and and , , , , of of of of of of of of of of of the of
so how is a human with to things to .
there &apos;s a the the features , , so so so , , of things things things things things
there are a where of where where where where where where where where to to to
but there &apos;s also a functions functions why are somebody for a a little of of of where where where which which which , , , , , , , , , , it it it not not not not not not not not not not
we are more more the the the , on the the of that we we we we we of of of of of
back to my real topic natural natural financial , and subject of of of course course of of of of of of of
and , means , , , can can can can can can a a a a a , a or a a a a a a a a a a a , , , and and . .
so , &apos;s &apos;s the the . .
how can i do something more more more more
i can do the right right or i i i i , , i i i to training training training
and less &apos;s or or or &apos;s &apos;s it it
that i just just that different , and beautiful beautiful , not it it it better better better better better
you have to understand understand .
and if you &apos;re the software software that we we seen seen at at at , , you you you to to of of of of our our our is is is , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and is is not a of of of a a of of of of of , , , , , , , , , i i i i i to to to to
why ?
because in the rule we we &apos;re through through new new of the of of of , , natural natural natural , , , , , , , , goal goal goal goal goal goal goal goal goal goal goal goal goal goal goal goal goal goal goal goal
you have to imagine that they you you you do something the the the , , , , , , new new new of of of of of of a a a
it doesn &apos;t mean they you be to hours hours hours hours hours hours , , , you , , , you you you you you to to to four four four hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours
but i want to say that it &apos;s a to of of of of , , , , , , , . .
and we we we to to the the the the the the the the the the the the the the , , which which was , where where where where to to with with with systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems
then the next thing that now now with with , model model model model model model model model the software software software , , have have have have have a a of metaphor metaphor metaphor metaphor metaphor metaphor metaphor metaphor metaphor metaphor to to to to to
so not more zeros and and or or or , , , a a a metaphor . metaphor .
this is the whole whole of of of , , but but &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s more more better better better
the next generation of the previous of the &apos;s much much more with with
so , &apos;s a much much more more more more than than that that .
this is also a paradigm paradigm .
that i that that that that that always always for for for for , , the the the a . .
and if i &apos;m a step step to to in natural natural natural , where where where i from , , , , , , , , , , , , , and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and more
but that &apos;s me to to point point point point , the the things things things really ?
if you &apos;re honest , and i i to to to my little little and and what what means what what of of of of of of of of is is is is
and that is for for for is is something , i i to about about about about about .
so apparently doesn &apos;t like to think it , it it it it it it it
the less i think about about about , , is it it
and what does that mean for the designers ?
that means when we can look that we can can to of of of on on on , , example example metaphor , , i i i i that that .
this means i can do a intuitive , human human human a a software software software software software software software software software
and course , the question is is is is the the the of of and and now now now now now now . .
this is the so-called of .
it uses everybody of of and and and is is is and and and and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
it makes everybody of of all time time , but he he &apos;s it , and , , , , , , , . .
the model is already to be the the in in and and and and and and &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s and and and and and and and and , , , all all that all that that that that that that that that that that that that
so , the of of to to about about about about about to to to to to , , , , , , , , you then then then then then less to to to to
i can now to this mental mental mental of , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and by this kind of the , similar like the metaphor of the the of of the , , , but not a a a a a a , , a a a a a a a a a a a a
and this is a higher of of the the the the the the the the of of a a a metaphor is the the the the
and if i &apos;m going to to the , , , example example i i i i i i , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
then i can accelerate the whole whole .
i &apos;m trying to get that a a .
it has every every . .
and : now i &apos;m going of the object , , , , , , , ,
i get the whole whole of , , now now now and and can say just just just all all of of of of .
and once , a a , what more more and and much much of .
because , that can can the things like the the of the the , , can can and to to to to to , , , as as of of of of of of of of of of things things of of things
imagination is more more more of , , , , , , , to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to you
i want to give you to a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first one you &apos;re going to be a child , , baby baby , , they they they they they they they they they they they , , , , , , you you you you you you to to to , , , , , , ,
and the curiosity doesn not learn to learn .
so , all are are are are are are and are , people people people who have have have have you &apos;t learn learn learn learn
now , &apos;s &apos;s about this this whole whole whole whole , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . . . . .
and there &apos;s a central point in . .
and that depends on phosphorus .
and a chance a chance
every day you give give give you you about two two two two two , every every every two two two two two two sheep . . . .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only be a a a of the the the
if we don &apos;t get to to , and and .
nonetheless , it &apos;s that we we we with something something something something something something what what , , , , but but not not not not not . .
because all about energy about energy , but nobody about about the the . .
the most thing thing is much critical .
we depend from two countries .
we just have to to two years and and and &apos;s going to to the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
in the last 20 years , these years years of years are been been of in in in in in in .
and that take all all .
it makes delicious in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less less less .
so , for example , the environment , the environment , , , . .
the environment , environment environment , , less less less
the environment , environment environment , , , energy energy energy
but that &apos;s not protection protection .
this is like i i say , , , , , child , , , , times times times times times times times
this is just a little bit deep .
if we think about the bee to the the to the the , , our our whole whole to to to to to . . . .
so about the the the the the . .
and the most important thing is is at at the the , the the the .
in the ground , over 60 percent of the the &apos;s of the the
now , we we build to and and and and and and of of tons per per per per , , , square square square square
that means we lose about the the the about times times times than than .
we can of at of the the the the the
and everything is a or or content .
in example , for example , the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
and because we &apos;re older , that are going to be the .
this is kind of all of the the the the .
yes ?
a baby needs about a paper .
we could of that of of of percent percent , but what does do ?
that will going to be in china in in second .
this is completely revolutionary .
so the question is , how do we go with these this ?
here &apos;s the of the evidence that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to the the the the the the the the .
the people the the the .
yes .
so , can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s is , , , ?
so we think think the the the the the , we &apos;re &apos;re too the the world world
and if you &apos;re people people people people people people people people people if if if if you say , , , , , , , , , , you , you you , , , and and and and .
and so someone says al al gore , one of our our heroes , there &apos;s nothing no of of human human population population population population population population
in israel , you said , if you &apos;re a people of a , , you you the .
here &apos;s what , more more more more more more more .
yes .
the first question is , are we really too too ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of ants on the earth earth , then the the , more than than than than .
i could also push me , but in the united states nobody nobody , , , , , , even though they they &apos;re .
that means the ants are more more than than we
and because they &apos;re physically more harder than than we we because because just just three three six months months , , , in in in in in in the the the . . . . . .
that means we &apos;re not too too , we &apos;re too to , ?
and where you see how far we we we we we we we to we and and and and and sad we we we we we we we earth earth earth , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
you can only be the more of , you you you &apos;t , ,
the only chance .
do you have seen a a tree tree
yes ?
one one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we we to be up to trees , ,
yes ?
no tree is a a
fortunately , yes , yes ?
there &apos;s no a of of trees .
there &apos;s still six in the the the . .
so you heard heard about about of of of of of ?
that means all our intelligence intelligence means we we we to be up to trees .
and where they see , even something like like , , the the , , , , , , to to our our our our to to back to to
every year we we so three million tons of phosphorus , that really to to go back in
and that are too too too .
alone alone alone .
we means we feel so so so so earth earth earth we we we &apos;s there no no no no no no no no no no no , , , , , , , , , , to to to to to to to to to to to to
is that not sad ?
so we are too too .
it &apos;s safe to be less less , which oil oil .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to try our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about a , , , a a , that is useful
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s the environment , , the , , , , , , , ?
so , yes , yes
you can only have the of of you you you you &apos;re .
even if you would now to , they would get .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it .
we can go our nutrients .
we &apos;re doing in brazil agriculture in where where we the nutrients nutrients
right , we can can this kind of of in agriculture agriculture
we &apos;re doing in china china china , where we we take take take of of of
in china , a a a a a of of of , , , , , , , ,
and in our western world , we were always too stupid , nutrients nutrients
that means the whole western western is is that that that city city city just , , but but but but never never never
so , cities had to grow grow grow , because because the cities cities cities cities cities cities cities to to to to their their their their
so all all rich rich are always always , they they they &apos;t they they they they they they they they .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done the about about about years years years because you always able able to to
even today , if you &apos;re to to to to china china you you you they they they they they as they they they to to to
because it &apos;s largely to go and and nutrients nutrients .
you &apos;ve them them them you you to to to to , to
it means you can see see the the internet , you can can nutrients
this is actually beautiful , , , you you do , , , , , , , , , a a a with with with with with in , , , , , , , , , , and and and and and and and and and and and
and the great thing thing is that the the the the the the the the the around over
so we don &apos;t have to control people , be more bad bad bad .
we can support them , good good .
this is of course course , , , , , , are . .
the novelty is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed designed by the design that that can can can it . .
that means that go go go back back back back
and no of these these , we &apos;ve built now the the the the the last years years years , , , , , , been been
they could just just a a a of of of and and then then then would would be be years
it doesn &apos;t find . .
that means we don &apos;t need to control people people , more bad bad bad .
we can support them , good good .
that means we need to phosphorus phosphorus .
and the the way , if you want to do what you want to write write , , in , the the the the the the the the of the
unfortunately , not in in in , , but but you you you the the the the bit bit bit bit bit
because the most powerful plant could be on the the the .
and the must to back back .
we see that that phosphorus really really really .
and we see that it &apos;s &apos;s . .
we &apos;ve used in in three years years .
the dutch government has explains , they will be the first first the the world world . .
but we need that all .
you understand , there are two countries who control control almost percent percent of the world world world world
there &apos;s a a of of a of of of of
these are the countries of countries the the percent percent of the the
and the oil we replace replace replace by other other .
but the phosphorus is not replace to replace you .
so &apos;s &apos;s not about make the existing of a less less less bad bad , , &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s something something something .
and that &apos;s all to ask what the the is is .
it means it about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in scotland , you course , , , because because because in is is is the the on . .
yes ?
imagine if example example , your your , sad , , if you you you you you , and and they they with with . . . . .
completely greenland .
but it , yes ?
or take a a of .
a woman in germany eats about six six three three three during their life life
it .
this is not not right right because because because we don know know how much much will going to be be
but a computer of , even in this boxes , i can tell you , completely completely , , , , , , , , , ,
and of what is beautiful is is is not .
it &apos;s not not , , , but efficiency .
so ask what is the right ?
not , the the thing thing more better better better and and and and and and and and the the the the the the the the the , , , , , , , , , to to to
so , efficient efficient .
yes ?
if i &apos;re them to dinner , , , , , , , , there a a a a a a a water water water water water
wonderful , ? ?
this is efficient .
everything in life is beautiful is not not .
if you love in somebody , , ?
yes ?
that means what in in life is is is not not to to to to to .
the whole of thing .
we say people people , oh , , , you &apos;t have have a in south south south .
no , that &apos;s just exactly right right right right ?
in every , where you &apos;re to to , , , , , , , , , , .
but the wrong things .
if you do the wrong things of the things , you have have a
in we think about north from . .
there &apos;s a commercial of the
if you walk , yeah , , every nuclear nuclear the ground .
because the ground is going to the the the the the the the and the the water the the the the the
but if you &apos;re in italy , everybody means , , , that that water water is in the the the
so , it &apos;s about to a big commercial commercial that is a a .
not not
we say in germany sustainability .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how do you do you you your your ?
so what you you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , , , , , , , , ,
this is just the minimum .
so not saving , , , , , . .
every waste is is .
and it &apos;s a serious , you you see in italy , how people in the high high the the the the car car car car car
because you know , this is a a of process .
it &apos;s a form of the , , , ? ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please beautiful .
we &apos;ve developed a a of of , that is is is is is . .
you can go them , where they go go go .
in two hours , they &apos;re around around .
and they contains seeds of rare plants , so they they through to to to to .
that means we are useful , not less toxic .
so it &apos;s two two of . .
not all all course course course course course course
a television or a machine machine that use use use use use use use use .
just the things that the the , , like like like like like like like like like like like , , , , to to to to to in in systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems systems
the things that are used , in in in systems .
but today we just talking about the biological systems systems .
yes ?
for example , the most of , yes ?
and direct observation , and it &apos;s not for the company , , but but that that that this this this this this this . . . . .
because we don &apos;t do do things things the things .
yes ?
so , if i &apos;m them to you you , food , , , , , free free free free , , , you you you
no , we &apos;re going what inside . .
positive .
so not like like of
not not in .
it &apos;s what is is is .
these are the first shoes that you can can the the of the the the the the the the the the the the the the , , , ,
all of this is of of .
and if it &apos;s us , , , , , , , , for for for for for , , , , , , and the and industry industry
and that is half of all the the world world world world are by by industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry industry
it &apos;s help help , , ask ask people people people people people .
hey , uh-huh , power &apos;s really serious ?
because that &apos;ve already already the the the the the
and i &apos;m not sure sure you you really really to
so , help me me a little bit bit .
but it &apos;s .
yes .
that &apos;s what just been . .
that &apos;s .
we can do the things that they you you you you you you you you you you you can can in in in in
technical &apos;s is &apos;s . .
there &apos;s the that of a commercial .
this is the first ecological of , actually , that is is that the the the .
so , that , , , , , can can can the the
if you come on , yes ?
do you remember the the the of
now , the is the waste .
all these these are are , almost almost
in the countries where people come come money .
there &apos;s the the the the , but but but the the the the , ,
if we change the plastics , so it can go in biological systems , if we change the the the , , , can can can can to to to to , , , can in in in in in in in in in in in . . .
yes ?
and you take these these these these , , , , , , , and and and and to to to to . . .
so this baby baby the the the the the whole life , , . .
so , we don &apos;t need a to of we we we we be be be
it &apos;s kind of a a of of a
yes , somehow of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent all . .
i started a institute .
now , there are many lot people people with and and can can all all
there are extra one of a , , , where where where where where where
so not more save , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , smart
does you make that curious ?
thank you .
the work of the the of .
music than language .
in the description , my talk , i i i i a a a , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . . .
the , of the the the the the the the in in in .
that you don &apos;t just a a word word word word word word word a a a a , , , , but sense sense sense sense sense sense , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , do do
and the german to to the english english , , , , , , , if if if if if if it or or poetry . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
but it is is for for , what we we we with with our our
and a a of a a , , i , the the the . . .
they think sure that the the in the notes right right all all all of of what he he .
in fact , the notes are very very and and .
these notes are about exactly just or or , like a , , , , very very very , , , , , , . . . .
because in this 1930s , the smell is not smell smell smell flowers flowers the the the the of the the the the the of the not not not not to the not not not not . . .
this means that the the of the to to to this this of of of of of of of of of , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
now i want to to you what i i more more , , so , , , , , , a language language language language language language
so , a translation translation translation translation translation translation translation
so i &apos;m going to do it to to the whole , , , , because because i i to to to to to to to to to to to to to translation translation translation translation translation translation translation translation translation translation translation translation translation translation translation translation translation
so the music works for for me me as as as the . .
the most of notes have the function of of of of of . .
so it &apos;s &apos;t going to learn , only , , and and to to to the the the the the right right right right right
so that would be just letters letters that you learned to to . .
the sense of letters letters you you you if you can can language .
so you need to to the the learning of music music music music music for for for for for .
there &apos;s also , you you learn it to the the the the , , , , , , can can to to to to the the musical musical musical
the work of the the &apos;s is is similar like the the of
after you first a a piece of , , , because because because because about about you you you to to of of of of of of of of of
you &apos;re information information information the the the the the the the
you read in the letters , , , , , , , , whether whether , , , the the the the .
you studied the work that he has been and and and .
you &apos;re facts .
the saddest , it &apos;s writing .
how did he he ?
how did his touch , how the society society and politics ?
this all all interested interested .
you think in this time , by , , , , , , , or or literature literature
but with time , you &apos;ve have a a a a a a a a , , , , you you you you , and and it it it it it it to to . . . . .
the dove is always getting to be to to with you you live .
his cause , writing piece of writing , will more more more more more personal personal , it . .
now , the notes notes all all other a a of of of the the the the the the the the the , , , , , , , , , , , , this to to and meaning meaning meaning meaning meaning meaning
i say say with my own words words , that could be this this .
i play the of of that that that that that this .
now for for and for the the and and and and you you you for today today today today
every sound , every sentence of this sense , because i i feel because because because because &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s now
it has to be for me in here and and now , , , , , , to to to to to to that that my my my
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , when i can have experience experience experience that that piece piece that i i i long long as to . . . .
as you &apos;ve been a happy new day once even even the same same of of life , , , , , , , work , , , , , , i , , , the the the the the the the the the the
i &apos;ve become a day day day , , , , , , my my night night night night , , , , , , , the the sound back back back back back back back back back
i suppose that stop to the the the the , , , . .
all of this , and and all this the the experience experience the the the
so is is , i i &apos;m with a a on stage stage stage stage and we the the . .
then the same thing happens in a good good , , , .
you bring a new idea in and and and to to to answer response response response response
it &apos;s exciting because because things things things we we we have have have and and and you can &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t .
it makes great fun to make on this music , and they you the audience audience audience the the the music life life .
so , concert is a a concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more as like this this moment
i can &apos;t play so play like in in years years .
i &apos;m going to have more more more more today today and and and going to to on my my of of of of of , , and and emotions emotions emotions emotions emotions emotions emotions emotions emotions emotions emotions emotions emotions emotions emotions emotions emotions emotions emotions emotions
sure , i &apos;m going to have some of of of of of , , , but but but but but but new new new . new
and a nice a example example . .
it was on a a of of the of my my my my teacher teacher teacher , , , , , , , , , , , , , professor professor professor professor , , , the of of of
unfortunately , i was too lot too young too young so he was was was to i i i started started .
but i had the great fortune , it very very early early with with years years , and i i i to high high high . . .
i was at at , i i i on a of of his his and and and the last of four four four of of , , , ,
he asked me what the introduction of this these of this this for me
this is so a a part .
and in my favorite , i said , , . .
there he he , he he , , ,
that has to be the the of .
because for me , they means .
he was already 60 60 .
well , with 17 , you have dreams dreams , but no a memories .
i &apos;m going the the of of the few years and and it it it it it , , just only only only only only only
every time is &apos;s exciting , because again i i something new new .
a example of a very different different area , it has has the the the of
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different different , , , , of of
he &apos;s built the the of of , , as it it it it it it it it in in in in . .
his personal of the the of the
the main interpretation interpretation of a is is this . .
now , i also older older than as with with with with years years , he he he
he &apos;s been been in years years .
and it &apos;s important to look at the the notes , , , i i i , , . .
to think , right right right with the the .
because the notes are the only connection directly him .
especially , he died died .
now , how do you start to speak language language of music
i said , you need about about for for for for for for for .
often the the the is is that that that you read read read .
you &apos;re learn to to that before before you just talk a a a . .
you learn to find the sound to find the notes on the
if all fingers fingers at at at at like like like it it the the notes notes , , , then then together together sound sound music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music music
if that &apos;s what , the students the the the of of the
over quantum &apos;s not about about the the . .
well , there &apos;s the front of the the , that is a a piece piece
the , slowly slowly slowly . . .
according loud and and , , , , , , , , .
that know most here .
but if though you &apos;re this this this , it it still still something . .
and it &apos;s not not a interpretation .
i wonder me .
i wonder that you often really something very very very .
so , to make music on the instrument , that that , , , , , and should .
so that &apos;s .
a child that &apos;s &apos;t &apos;t that , because because &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t parents parents parents , it it not it it . .
this is like the the of .
it &apos;s necessary , have own own own and of of music music to it a another another way way way a , , , to to .
people who never have , , never never never with with body body body body it it a a a . .
a phrase with make own own own own
so the the is is the the of our body .
our favorite of to sing , our hands , and to to dance .
so the the the the the the the the the the my my my .
the tune comes from the the of the the the the the the dance dance dance dance dance dance dance dance dance dance dance
the waste of the is is with music &apos;s &apos;s .
you don &apos;t need more to make more even , it &apos;s &apos;s a .
not more required to avoid a a or or to or .
every own music is going to be , you you going to to to with with music music
sure , there are some of them , you say , , , , what what if if if if if &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t ?
so question i can &apos;t , you , , , , because they they they can &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t
or b , because they don &apos;t have to sing ?
it &apos;s is not too late late to to to out whether whether whether it &apos;t it , , , learn learn , , , , , , that that that , , , , , right right right right right right right right right
so that can train .
or c , because you have them them you you you you they they .
so &apos;s i , how was was this this this
have you have a a of or a of of , , , you you you you you you
or d , they may &apos;t like to music music music and to to do do do do do
but what i &apos;d , , , because is is is a , , , thing thing
but maybe you can also do them more more .
well , so you &apos;re , , all of of a a a a a
but tell you say , , i i &apos;t understand &apos;t the the music music music
i can &apos;t say if it &apos;s good or bad .
i , , , but , you can you you you you you you not not
because i don &apos;t think it says , , i don &apos;t know whether , i i i i i &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t
so , they don &apos;t get to to the food , because because because because &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t
so you don &apos;t have to get a music music music music because because because &apos;t play play .
listen aware and say say if it whether it or not not .
whether the music you to to to too too too too
tell that what you feel .
and the time , you get to to more more more more more more more more , , , , , . . . . . . .
why do i do now to my that that it it active
because the music is a language , and language is to communicate . .
a piece that you never look at , no no force .
the food , that was was by a chef or a chef , , , , , not not not not or or or or . . . .
so you hear listening , a music music music .
it &apos;s not just a nice of .
if in environment environment where where adults do do music or or , , , , , child child child , , a a a a a , , , , , , , , , , , ,
can you also play me in blue ?
and the child is , after a a of , rather rather a a a blue blue .
and this sounds very different than .
and that the the first first of a own musical expression expression
so the first step to a interpretation .
and what happens if you &apos;re a piece of today that that that a a , ago ago , ago ago ago ago ago ago ago
now , the instruments are .
there was a a of of the a a a a
it was just invented .
i think the stream has been been been if he he had the the the of of of today modern modern
i can have the the of that the the the the the the the the , , , , , , , &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t
and of , , you know that he heard heard more than he been .
today , a modern orchestra in to to everything everything a a of of of of time of of
so the premise are on on on the the the the the the the . .
so you &apos;re going to be what you &apos;re just in in in the .
and that what you think think in the mind mind .
or that what i i i to to because because because because you you you you .
thank you .
you know what transition is ?
did they have a ?
and how did that feel ?
pascal .
i have a friend that goes a a a .
if i get , , with little little little of , , , and and , , , , , feeling feeling .
i &apos;m going to through something through head head
i say , , , , need need need need to to to
it &apos;s the the of of of of of his of
and all , you &apos;re more much more more than than
why do i have to make so little little little ?
and then i immediately immediately that that that &apos;s .
it &apos;s against the justice .
and as i say the word justice is this this this feeling path .
our organism has invented a great method to make such these like like like to to .
you can try to to with words words like or or or or or or or
i want to explain you with this mechanism today something something something something something what you with familiar with with .
the mechanism from the .
but think about the , , , you you you you you you people people , no no a a a wall wall wall wall wall wall wall wall
and then rocks , , , , , the the the the
so a lie , you see that the pursuit itself not not thinks he he he .
it &apos;s going to easy easy easy that it it it &apos;s in in sense sense sense
he &apos;s just just , and not even .
no , the lie i talking talking about that that that that that they they themselves . .
they need these lie to get a a a to to a a .
you can get you less , yes , , , , , , , .
they need time .
from this time , a anecdote that you might know .
the brown painter ended is a a woman woman .
this woman has , , the the the would &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t .
picasso says , wait , wait .
it &apos;s always going to similar .
and this time , if you you laugh , you know how important these lie and and how how much time you to about something what what very very very very . . . .
because artists have a violent relationship relationship lie .
the artist is you something something , and and of of of , , you you you see you just just just just the mirror mirror mirror
the artist is you in a a magazine something something , you they &apos;re &apos;re going to to to to at this this .
then this mysterious feeling , it may &apos;t see you you you you it it it it going going to .
so you have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention invention invention invention invention our our
and not only in art , also in the the in , in in in in in in in in in in in .
you may know this idea of the lady of the the , that morning morning the mirror mirror mirror , , who who the the the the the country country country ? ? ? ? ? country country country country country country country country country country country country country
one day this this mirror , yes , there &apos;s a a of .
behind the seven mountains and so on on
and you also know how much of of this true true , , the can can can , , , , that true true .
but we should just do us that that that you can &apos;t &apos;t say a that that there there a a there there
here &apos;s necessary , that we we we under under of of , , again again
we need this this these these that that that that us the deception without without we we &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t .
we don &apos;t just have in art in in the the , , , , , , , , . . . . .
and there &apos;s the story of the woman of the the of the the &apos;s of of
they heard heard this book of charles darwin who the of of of species and the of of of of
that the human of the , should should , , , , , , least least a a ancestors and and and and . . .
and then they went to her her husband husband she , , , that &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s charles charles charles .
the human is should to the the of , or a shared .
no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , we need to prevent that people people to to of .
why do we need people that people people to to to it it &apos;s &apos;s true
because we cannot &apos;t live any these these of of .
because we &apos;re these these , this feeling , great , , , the the the the , , not from of of of of of like like like like that that that that , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
so , we can &apos;t be these things things .
we need to prevent that people are to to to things , , , you they &apos;re &apos;re
so you see how slowly that this mechanism mechanism of and and how the the the that that that that to to to something something something to to to , , , , , , , , to to a story
a particularly nice story , how i mean .
my wife told me me .
they came one day day school , , she teacher teacher and she told told one student .
a a student students .
they may like to be it because because he a a to .
and they asked him what are are because your
and he says he , , , i i i the fire fire .
and because i &apos;m the the fire , i &apos;m &apos;m to for for of . .
yes , you feel it , you &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re on this this this this &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s . .
i said my wife , , a person person in a moral moral moral the the the , , , , we we we we to to to it it it
do that and then then then the sentence .
although i &apos;m the the fire , i &apos;m &apos;m to for of . .
they feel that that &apos;s the real truth behind the .
so a little little of of that that in interested interested in not .
the interested interested interested in the .
but there &apos;s no empty that we can look at where you learn how learn how how fire .
there &apos;s just the second second , the fire .
it &apos;s he .
and , , , , , , , , , , &apos;t &apos;t you to to to to to to to to to to to fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire
no , it just just much better better , we we we we we we for to to to to that that other other other other other other if you you fire fire
here you have this little mechanism .
this these these these of that that that that the the the the the the that that that that that to to to to , but but but that not to say .
here you have these these of between the the and the the , the the , , that that can can something something something that things things things things things that that that that that that that that that that that that that they they they they you much
so then then these words words that that we we we use the the language language language the political political
we actually know that something else is the the case .
but we know if we we this this , the the social social very very . .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible , these things in a society , that should work to . .
now i want to you you what we &apos;ve in my my institute .
after what logic that deception deception these these , that , , , , another another another , that we we we actually actually that that that that that to to to to to
i want to want you two two , maybe three examples examples .
the first example is to to what of of of you you you you of of of of of , just just all all .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is so something more , , about about .
it &apos;s something that not not stop stop , , nature nature nature
and if you have people who are the the of belief , they you have soul soul , you you can say that that they they the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the , , , , , , , ,
and from this soul , you think you you you kind in this this , , in this this this this nature nature nature , , , , , , , , , , , , . . .
and then this this of of the people people people people people people , then then then , with with with with with with with with , , , , , , , , , , , with with with with with with . . . . . .
and then he can do the . .
this is the idea , the soul works .
so they should to to go from the people .
so we should be them something something something what should should be be our our life . .
and if you have this this , eyes you you the logic , that we we we that happiness , , , a a our world .
because now you can apply a a of .
you know know know of of . . .
so this is a a a a that tells us us us us
this is the the part part my talk part my talk .
here you need something logic , but also the tendency to lie .
so that , that that can can just this logic . .
in this this of three three three three .
the first sentence is , the , , , &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s soul
so the second sentence is , if a &apos;s has has has , he he &apos;t . .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i &apos;ve particularly it here here .
a third sentence , immediately immediately on people people who a a sense sense for a .
the who who doesn &apos;t who , , is is dead and can &apos;t .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s this logic in this , yes , in this this of the to . .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences that are are correct .
i i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make about about about reality .
i can say that the the is is is man man
and if i have right , the the is is a man man
if i don &apos;t right have , the the the is is not .
the logic doesn &apos;t make the statement about what true .
i can say everything .
but crucial key , , i i i right , , , &apos;s &apos;s .
so if the &apos;s says is there &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical correct .
and now our our of consciousness is , , that can do do something .
it &apos;s a third sentence to do that nothing with with the first two two and and that that the the the the the of first first first of and . . . . . . . . .
because actually , we have to prove whether it &apos;s the soul or not not
but with this logic that it just use use that two sentences are are are , , and third third third that that looks looks like that that that that that that that we we we we we we we our
so , we &apos;re so as it it be be to be a soul life life .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can go these things things different examples examples
in the present of about we we a a modern example example that that the the the the the
you have to do a another subject , a a of , the philosophy philosophy philosophy , . .
that has that that we we back back back the the the .
there was a battlefield who was called , , and the the the the the the the the the
the most thing is is is a a is is is is .
the doesn &apos;t have this soul .
this is so a a .
and if you put the exactly in the middle between two two of two , , , then then
because he doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s he to to to .
so he &apos;s exactly in the middle .
so the the the is is .
the forces forces forces with with with with other other other other other
there &apos;s nothing happening anything .
just if you get another another example , so you you you a a a a bigger , he he doesn &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t .
automatically he automatically to to right right .
if you have this idea that you &apos;re driven in nature nature nature , , , , , , of the the the the of of that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that
and if we &apos;re also in in in the the the the the the the , , i the the the the of of of of of of
there &apos;s a predator that &apos;s called called called , and and says says you says , , , , &apos;s no no no no no no no
now we can share the second sentence , and can say if if if if , , , has has has &apos;t &apos;t .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can read in day day in the the the that find find this this third .
the looks about that who not not not not , , , , for for and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s
it &apos;s it it it again
you actually have to to to to to to to it something like like
but the logic of deception allows us us do do do as the first first of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of .
and now you can just want to you want to do anything anything if you want want to something something , if want want want want to to to to to to . . .
and , that , example you you you you you people people you you you you can can there no no no no no
and please don &apos;t use the german word for a for word for that called called .
it can &apos;t call them that that would then then a little bit political political
tell , there &apos;s no a of .
immediately you you going to to , for of of of of of , , , , can &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t prove prove
and you have a problem .
because while they &apos;re busy , , , they they they they &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t not not not &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he she .
because he led led to a a a , , he &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t to
because actually , this human is not interested in in .
he &apos;s just interested in that , , to to to to to to to to to to to to to
so , in the way of the change of the , they they the the of of
and if you have to to to a way to feel this of of of people people , , , they because because because because because happy happy they they they they they they they you you way way
thank you for your attention .
yes , good day .
i &apos;ve got i i i i i i i i you you
it &apos;s one of the most powerful here here here this this event and me me if i i i talk talk talk and and and idea idea idea idea
i have to say honest , you have it it it to to to to to to to to to to .
and i may imagine my my my i i i &apos;m &apos;m to you .
but it &apos;s of course the of of of , , ideas ideas ideas
i probably probably to to the two two two girls , , i i i to to to the the the the that that that that , , , , because because because because because because , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and then , the the the the the the the the , , , because because because i to to to to and was was in in in in
there was the most of of the
the most time time all the the the the the the the the the the
the name today today today .
because a good engineer has built great cars cars or or or
but that , like , , , n , , , of of of of of of of of of of of of of of
and in berlin , there was an crazy of .
i &apos;m grateful the the to that that he that word word second second second to to because because because to to to to to to word word word to because because because , , , was bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad
but that was not not the the the years the the
it was that that there was a of of of of and and and of of of in in in in in in in in where where the
and the the of the , , but it was was was and and and and and and and and and and and i i the of
and yes , a lot of what was was was , me , , , many many many many of of of of of that i i i &apos;ve .
i worked been in in the the the the that was was was
we were twenty people .
if one no said , , was the the thing thing was a a a a a a i i i i i years i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i ,
it &apos;s busy with with .
and that was really very , very very of and and and and and in in in in , , , , , , , , , , , , i i i i i , , years , , , , , , , , , , ,
and then i &apos;ve to to to and and then then then we with with with with i i i i the company company company company the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the world world world world world world world world
a a of , but , , , , we we of of of of of a a and and and and and and a a , group group group decided decided decided decided decided decided decided start start to to to to to to to to to to
and i brought you a project that i i to introduce you you .
and the title of the speech was , , how you to to to .
and we just started asking with a a a of of of , where where where you because a a a a .
on this island , that is the island island on the the the the the
yes , that are so data .
there &apos;s four thousand thousand people .
and have a agriculture today of 15 15 15
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
that &apos;s just technological .
if you &apos;re more more other other other , , system system system .
i &apos;m also that the politicians , , if they in in in in our our
so , say say why ?
we &apos;ve already been 20 percent in germany .
can &apos;t &apos;t be problem problem .
but not , we have in in seven seven seven and our our is is the the .
if we have in in europe 20 , , we have have the same problems that people people on on island island . .
the question was just , was was was was of of the the the first first first first first first the the the the the the the . . .
as big , , , , a a a a so so so so so so island island island island , , , , , , , , maybe maybe percent percent percent .
and yes , i &apos;m going to a a a .
the conventional system looks over the world world .
by the way , per year about a hundred hundred , , on on on on on the the
this is the performance of a performance of , because because &apos;s particularly everywhere everywhere
the the of the world world is is going to to to to to , because because because because because &apos;t &apos;t
that &apos;s fast .
you &apos;re so box box .
and then it looks like the rule rule .
in the walk , three of the the , , two will will going to to to .
yes , this is a that is the the the the the
we also have very very data data .
and the most thing or the oil or or or whatever is is is is is the rule rule rule a a a system system system system small small small small small small small . .
our goal was just to say , okay ,
the is is is going to the the wind wind wind wind wind sun the the that that the the the of of
and if you want to go about twenty , percent percent percent , energy energy energy , , not not the the performance , , , , to to to to to .
that means that to to to that that that that that that that of of the the whole whole .
and can course you you of of , you &apos;re in in some some of way
that has done done that on the world .
there &apos;s the in the the style , , you can also the the car car car car a a of of of
people always ask me what what &apos;s &apos;s because because in in in in
that &apos;s what .
but if you want to get several of these these of these , and and and and build a a a is is is . complicated . . . . . . . . . . . complicated
and our goal was , we we to to come to to to percent percent percent percent and then then and this rest rest rest rest last last last , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
that will be to be a a a that that which , , , , , , , , force , , , , , , , , will be be be
you have to go more to a a and and and and and and just just just just just
we just wanted to know what is is because with normal normal , , , , .
how far is you come there there ?
and then , a whole of of of made made .
and have wind and sun and the altitude of the and and to the result , , very very of of that that you to to the the the the the the of of of of of of of of of of of of of of cents cents cents
this were the first calculations of six years .
and then we said , okay ,
so is great , we have a model model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the the thing thing , the the the the percent percent .
and then we started to with the the the .
what would everything done done done ? ?
have have been , , i &apos;ve been to new new .
we were just five people to build a to to society society .
and here &apos;s the representation .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system is a a a of that is that that we we we to to percent percent percent , and and and and other other other other other other other other other
and the most thing thing that the the the the the the the island island , , , that that . . . . .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t think you you can solve the the problem .
and so we decided to build a mall in in in where we we we the the of the the the the the the the the of of of .
that means we &apos;ve to to to to the the the the the the the world
here &apos;s &apos;s .
the comes from asia asia , in the case of japan .
and the , the the the the the the the the the , , , , , , , , , , and and and the the the the the the the japanese japanese
it can see see it it it a very , very big . .
it has a a performance performance and can get six hours hours hours this that that that battery we we we of of of of of of of of
and then you up up .
we also have one of these this that the the the the the the size , , , , in the the the the the the the the the , the the the , the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
here &apos;s the the whole whole the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
and here you can see the whole whole .
we can also make in the the the the the web web
here we see this again here we we again again again again again again again again , , , ,
and what we did been , since the the the the the the the the the until until until of of of of of of the the the the the the the , , , , , , , , . .
so we &apos;re not a a of , but we we we ourselves as company company just just the the the the the and and and and and and and . .
you have to communicate to the battery battery , you to to to to the the the and and and and &apos;s complicated complicated . .
the beautiful is on the subject that you basically basically on this island this the the the the the that we we we we we we we we we we we we we we of of . .
so this whole discussion , how will going to go back to and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
and , &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s to to to .
so , a a of of everywhere everywhere everywhere
we can start to the the the the the the , , , , , , , , , the the the the the the
it means if you &apos;re in 70 percent renewable , , you you &apos;t &apos;t do do without without .
you can get through n , , you can can through through the , , , , , , should , should to to , , , , , , , , , , , , , be be completely completely completely completely
and that is so n little of the . .
so many people come people people and look at that , because you see see see see see you you .
if we turn off the the , you you &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t that that that that that that a a a a a the the the web web
and our main of is is basically basically just of of of of of of of of of of of of of the the the the all all . europe .
we look looking at this net , , the 50 , , , and and it it to to nine nine nine nine , , , , , a a a of of of then then then then then then then then then back back back back back back
this is the system .
and of course , it is incredible hot .
if you &apos;re the somewhere somewhere , , it it it it .
the most thing thing has has at least to to to to the the .
and in time , you can react other other .
if you don &apos;t have the anymore , that this , , , , you have to replace replace with with with of of
and we can be with this big battery two two . .
you you see what what enormous of of there there there
and the message is , we need to get to to to these of of of if if we we we we our our , , laptops laptops 20 20 20 20 20 , 20 , , , , , we we we we we we we we we
then we need to put our our to into the net net net
and , &apos;s is is is is the the power power to to to the the the .
yes , that &apos;s a a of in moment moment moment moment , , , , , because because because because because because because because because because because because because because because because because because because because because because because because because because because not not because because because
and we &apos;re just trying to to that that the capacity to the the the to to turn , , , , the the the the the
now , there is a whole lot of studies . .
and to this purpose , people then and and and looking looking our our our of of of of our our of of
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you can a a of of future future
and many discussions that i had in the last six years years , similar similar the the that i i had the last last last the the . . . . .
not not , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . .
we have been now now in in in germany . .
this is a of of .
and i just go to that that we we the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the world world
just , it &apos;s going going come .
there &apos;s going a whole whole of of of of of of and and and
the beautiful is that i &apos;ve been been the the the two two years that the scientists the my my my .
we &apos;ve now to 10 10 million million of , , , to to to to the the the the the the the
this is going to be be next . . .
so from you you that there there there there there there &apos;s and and of of of of of of of of of , , , , , , . . . .
and if you have a hundred percent of renewable , it &apos;s like a a system system .
and , , to to to to to to to that that that that that that that that that a a a a a a a , has has has has with with with with with with
the question is is simple , , you they &apos;re completely completely independent of of of of of of the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the you you you &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re you you . island island island island
then they &apos;re use that what &apos;s sun and wind wind there where where they live .
and that is so little bit of our vision of a a of and and i i i grateful grateful that you you they , energy .
and that is what we do , and and and and , the the talk of the of of of of you you can can can can can can and and and a , a little . . . . . . .
and yes , i want want to you you to to to the sense sense you can can can be little little little crazy crazy and . . .
and you really have to stay quite pretty , but i think that &apos;s &apos;s .
thank you .
when steve , , the the los angeles , , , day day the the the the the the the the , , , he a wonderful wonderful .

robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something play that i i the the the the
i hope you &apos;m me .
so i &apos;ve been in lot lot fish fish fish
i just loved two two .
this first one that was more a a a of .
it was a beautiful fish , , , , , , , , , , , , , on on .
what a fish .
better , he was going to be to to the the the the of of of .
so you could feel to to sell him .
i had a relationship with a beauty about several months months
one day the the the of the company , and if i could could could a a event event the the the the .
&quot; of course , i said , i said .
here was a company to solve that that this this this problem has become for our our , , how we we fish our our ? ? ?
in the last 50 years , we have the ocean flying as we we we .
it &apos;s hard to to destruction destruction .
90 percent of the big fish , that we we love , the the the the the , , , , , , , , , , they they they .
it &apos;s almost nothing more left .
so probably probably be be be , , , , , , of of of of of of of of
many of about this . the environment of the environment of of of of of you you you you , , , , , , , , a . . . .
he has a a of of 15 of .
this means 15 15 are necessary , , , you you a a a a
not very sustainable .
taste &apos;s not very good .
so here finally was a company that tried to do it it .
i wanted to pick them .
on day the the the the the the the the the the the the the .
let &apos;s call call it .
&quot; not , , i said , &quot; just about the facts right , , &apos;re &apos;re famous , so far far far far far the the that that &apos;t &apos;t environment environment environment
&quot; that &apos;s true &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far far that that waste waste waste of our is not not not . . . .
and then he added , , we &apos;re basically in a world world .
this is of of of of of of , , said said
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
and , , great .
&quot; the of one what what what what you ? ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , he said .
&quot; great &quot; , i said . &quot; . .
and at this night , i was in bed and thought what what hell is a a protein protein ?
so i called the next day , short , the the event , , .
i said , &quot; no , what do are are sustainable sustainable ? &quot;
he said he he &apos;t &apos;t it . he &apos;s going to .
now , i &apos;m going to a a few people people in the the , nobody could could me me answer answer answer , i i with with with with biologists . . .
let &apos;s call it it .
&quot; not &quot; , i said , &quot; what do are are are sustainable ? &quot;
now , he mentioned some algae and some of some some and and he he he he ,
i said , &quot; &quot; ? ?
he said , &quot; yes , swimming , skin , skin , , , , , , , food food .
i said , &quot; how much percent of the are is is ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that are about 30 percent &quot; said he said .
i said , &quot; no , what is sustainable to to , , , ? ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too too much on the the . &quot;
i &apos;m going to get me from fish fish
no , not , i &apos;m a a of of and and and
i &apos;m actually .
no , i actually have a of of fish fish fish fish because because because i i , , , , to to to the after after after . .
this second fish , that is another kind of of .
it &apos;s the romantic way that kind that you you you you you you you you you fish fish fish the the the
i &apos;ve him him in a restaurant in in in in
a a a a been been about been the of of of .
it has us of of of of of
he came up the table with a bright , almost almost , , color .
the chef had him him him
wait twice .
nonetheless , he was still delicious .
who can be so fish so so so to after he was
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
let &apos;s call it pink . actually it &apos;s called .
and no , he didn &apos;t have the fish and and &apos;s &apos;s not a chef at at at at the that you i . .
he &apos;s a biologist in la la .
this is a a of in the the the the the .
it &apos;s close the the of the river river
until the the , the farm was the the of the hands of the
they were up on the the what basically basically in .
they did that by the country country .
they built this complicated consequence of the , and they &apos;re out out water water the the country and the the river river
well , they couldn &apos;t do that that work work not not .
and it was a disaster .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds to what are are are a many many birds
and so , a a company company company company the the country country
what did they do ?
they have the river of water .
they literally have the probe .
instead of the water water water they they they the the the water water water water water water water water water
they &apos;re the the . .
they created a command of of of of -- -- -- , , , , , , , , , , , , and and and and and and and and and completely
the farm is incredibly .
i mean , you never never seen something something .
they &apos;re out on the horizon , that is a miles miles away and everything they &apos;re &apos;re are of of and , , , , , , , , .
i was not long time time with with .
he &apos;s a incredible guy , three parts charles darwin darwin and a part of a for for . .
okay ? there we we and and us us through the and and and and and and to to to to to to , , , , , , , , , , , to a a
so he &apos;s a rare a of of
now he mentioned the the of of the .
and here , here &apos;s a pattern of of that that reminds him the the the .
it turns out that karl has the largest part of his career in the career in in national national in
i asked him how he become become to a a a
he said , &quot; fish ? i know &apos;t know fish fish .
i &apos;m a expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and and in more more of of , and and and and and and
and you don &apos;t understand me wrong that was really fascinating , you know the the the community community community community the the the way way way way
it &apos;s great , but i was love .
and my head was weak about this this of of of of , , that i i on the the
so i &apos;ve him him . i said , &quot; &quot; , how do it come that that fish so ? ? ?
he showed on the algae .
&quot; i know young , that algae , the the , the the , that is incredible .
but what food your fish ?
how is the most powerful ? &quot;
now , he goes to tell me that that it is a a system system that fish fish food would would would would in in . . .
the comfort biomass , the outer , the the , , is is is is is fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely completely .
there &apos;s no food .
je of one farm heard that their animals &apos;t &apos;t
later , i went on on on on with with with with and i i i said said &quot; &quot; &quot; a place place to to be be be to to , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , &quot; &quot;
in the moment , it was a a a a a a a
and we &apos;re a to the the and and us the most most most , , thousands thousands thousands thousands thousands of , , a a the the the the . . . .
&quot; that &apos;s success , he said .
&quot; look at your your of , pink pink
they &apos;re going to . &quot; &quot;
so , i i was was was .
i said , &quot; jason , do &apos;t you your your fish ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and and the the the birds .
now , last year , on this on , , , more than than different different species
it &apos;s been the biggest and one of the most important private in in europe europe europe europe europe europe europe europe europe europe europe
i said , &quot; jason , is not a good of of the the that that that you you to to to to to ?
he sells his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re going to build the , not not .
this is a a network .
the most powerful food the the .
the shrimp eat the the .
so the joke of the belly of the the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s illustrate this . . a farm that &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t their their and and and that that their their their their their their their their
a a of , but also a a a .
oh , and the the way of the , of of not not not be be
they &apos;re in a city city miles miles miles where where the is is better the the the the
every morning you fly to miles to the farm .
and every night they to to to miles .
they can do that because they can follow the the white white of the the of .
seriously .
i &apos;ve introduced a kind of journey of penguins penguins , i looked at . .
i said , &quot; jason , flies you to to the the the the and fly then then to to to
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at , i i i i a song song of of
he said , &quot; no . you do this because because food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my loved fish , the delicious was , and i i &apos;t like like i i i i i &apos;t like like like you &apos;t you &apos;t . .
it &apos;s this this of , , , , . .
i &apos;m never going to it .
and yet , when i tried to to you in this restaurant in in restaurant , , , &apos;t to to to to to to
they &apos;s sweet and in when when you would take a a of the ocean .
i mentioned the to the and and he he
he said , &quot; the skin works like a cube .
it &apos;s the last defense , before something in the body body .
it developed developed in evolution of evolution , to to .
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no have a . &quot; &quot;
okay . one farm that don &apos;t take their fish . one farm that their their success success their their their
and then i realized he he says , a farm that has no no no , , , , , , , , , water water water that that through through through from from the the the the the the the the river river river river
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things things to to to to to to to to to to , , , , , , , , , of of
and if it was the the system , and this is is water water water water water as it it
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s the water .
so not only a farm that don &apos;t &apos;t their animals animals not just just a farm that their their their their their their , , , a a a , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
because if the water is the water , , the the the the the the the
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m it to , and it , , because because , , , , , , , , also also also also
you could say that you is a recipe for the future good , whether we we talking about the or or of of
now we we need is is radical new new of agriculture , , , in in in actually actually good . .
but for many people , this is a little bit too .
we &apos;re not a more of , we we we we we . . . .
we love the . we love little little of of we we we about about about food food food food .
and if you say that that are things things are the the good good food , somebody somebody somewhere , says hey hey hey , , love love , , , , , , , , , the the ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
how are you get the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not , we &apos;re enough enough enough to feed the world more than than .
a billion people will going to be today .
a billion -- that is more than ever ever -- because because of the the the the distribution distribution the the the the
now , i don &apos;t like this question because they don &apos;t have the logic of our our 50 years years .
so grain on the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , time time time time time , , , , , , , , , , people people people
this was the power . it was the the of the the it it was the business of the american .
we should call them what you &apos;re , a a a in in in in , , , , , , , , that that that that that . . . . .
this is not a legal , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our our is is is today today not not because because because because but but but but but but but resources resources resources resources resources resources resources resources resources resources resources resources resources resources resources resources resources , , , , , , , , , , , ,
not through the latest of , and , , , , but but , country , , , , but but but but but but but but but through through through through through through through through , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that are to to to to to themselves
to do that , look don &apos;t look at the the the the the .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in in , and it it really really really really really good food food food food
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is the that &apos;s to to two billion years years
look at pink , farmers like like ,
and that are not for for for , , , , , more more more more more more , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , but but but but but but for for for for for for for
because they &apos;re those who are are experts for taste .
and if i really really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;ll be ever
you know , that &apos;s right , because if the future is is good good food , , &apos;s be . .
thank you .
if i want to put you today thing is is that that the the of of data data that we we we bigger bigger than than of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of
so what what we see here is a typical typical typical of age age
the program i use here , is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called called of of and i i can can do with i can i i i i i can can can certain certain , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and immediately i see a pattern that makes .
and that &apos;s because in the the of the the people people are are are and and are are over on the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
we can go a step step and and and data data data data data data and and and and and and and , , , , not not not not not . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
now , if we &apos;re going to and and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , that that that that that that about about about about
and who &apos;s is that that is is is in men . .
so they see that that look at information information information data in in in in in in in in in a living .
and if we can make this for techniques networks why not not not content content
now what we &apos;re here here are the the the single single single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ever ever ever
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can like to test it to my talk in your pond .
with the , of you you you can to to in in decade decade decade decade decade decade decade decade
you can be up in a a year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now , i i see here here i see the the that that that in this this this .
i &apos;m a a armstrong fan , so i &apos;m up up on all all all all the in in . .
now , if i want to get a a of of of , , i i think think , , , i i i i i at i the the
so i go back back back and and the the .
now i see kate .
and so you get a idea of it that you you to to to this kind of of information , , , , , , , , , , , , , not not not not not not not not not not not
you do something that &apos;s is a little bit .
it &apos;s something between between and we think it it it can can can can information information information
now i want to do this idea little little little bit bit bit bit bit bit bit bit bit bit crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy
what we &apos;ve done here , we we have single single single and and and on a little little . .
the winner is is a short of and a symbol for the area of the that .
i &apos;m just show the the the the the the the the the
but even in this this view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately we we a impression about the challenge that are on wikipedia on the the the
i &apos;m going to choose the theme of government .
now after after i &apos;ve , , , i i that the the the that that most most most most most most time the the the the the the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is really important , this is a insight that that not in a single single a a .
this is just to recognize if you &apos;re going to step and and the .
and on a particular of of of of of i i i the the the the the the the the year year , , , all all all together
now , if i look at these people people i i that the majority of of of of of of of of of of of some , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , &apos;s comes comes
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize . .
so we can jump and and look at at at all ted of
you see , we &apos;re the the the the time time time time it &apos;s &apos;s a a just just just just just side side , but but but but . . . . . .
and so i want to show you what other else could be a little surprise surprise .
i just show you just just just new york times . . .
and , , , , , -- -- i i &apos;t &apos;t call call call ; ; it &apos;s not not not , but but but can can at at at and and and and to this this this this this this this
so i can go back step step , and right to a certain certain .
so this is important because you just just at at the the of of of this way way way the the the way same way way way way way way
so i can put in my course of in a particular . .
here &apos;s the one demonstration that i i i i to to to .
and i can think of of i &apos;ve &apos;ve at at today again again again
and , if i &apos;m a step step , and and , , , , can can can , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , here here here here here
and from here i can go into the side and and and back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that will used again again and and every time time it picture picture the the than of of of of of of
now , in this world , we think , data data data is . .
we &apos;re talking about the of of the the .
we &apos;re talking the the in information information information
what if we could turn this situation , and the internet on the head head so so we we instead instead to to to to to to to many things things things things things things things , , , , that that that
if we can do this , this these will going to be , , a new new information information information information
and , instead instead just just to to , , we can can get .
and if we know , we can can even even even it it it
so i hear listening , thank you . .
i grew up with a a of science science science
in my school , i went with the bus to school , every day day a a .
and my nose was always in a book , a a , , a my my in other other worlds worlds and and and my my my my , my , , , , , , ,
this curiosity showed showed that that i i i i i i in school school , , , forests forests forests , , and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and
i was totally a , , know know .
it was always to to the world world the world the the the of of of of .
and my love to to to to in my my my , because , in the the late &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; , , , the the the the sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea sea
ezra fluctus came in our living with with his fascinating , that us us animals and and and world of of that we we never never before before before before before .
so that &apos;s probably very to to to this of of
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there &apos;s not video video video , that the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the , the i my my my my my my my my my
we had to do all time time time we we read a a , , , , the the of the and and and and the the the the the the . .
my response was this was and and and of of aliens , , , , , , , , , and , . .
in the most of , i was all by the teacher teacher , i , , , , , , ,
creativity creativity had to to of of .
and it happened interesting interesting what what what what &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s , , , was was thought idea idea idea idea idea us the earth earth earth earth earth earth earth earth . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
certainly i would never get a aliens world with a a , that seemed seemed me me .
but here was a world that i actually actually , here here on earth earth and and was was was and and like like like i i i i i i i i i i books books books books books books books books books books books books books books
so i decided to i i i to become . .
the only problem of that was i i in a small village village in canada , a miles miles miles miles . .
but i didn &apos;t &apos;t to to i .
i &apos;m going to , my father until until he he a a in in in , new york york york , , , , the the the the the the where where where we we we
i made my my in in a a of the the the the the in in in in in . .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got two two years to face , , we we california california .
since , , the the 40 years , that are are , , , three hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours hours in in in .
and i learned that the world of the deep , , even in the the , , the the , , , , , , we we we we we we we we
the imagination of nature knows &apos;t know boundaries , , in our own own own own , human imagination .
until i i i i i i , for for what i i i my my my .
and my love to to ocean the the same same same , and and and
and i i a a a a job a , , was was was
this seemed to to best best best to tell my inner , , tell tell , , , , to to to . .
and a child i i sold constantly the and and and and
so films were the way , images and stories and and . . together together
of course , the stories i i i to to of of the the the the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; i , i could mean my my for the the , the the and the the the .
so , of my two passions passions .
something interesting happened happened &quot; &quot; &quot; to solve a a problem in this this -- -- this and we we we we a a of of of of , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
what &apos;s out out the the the was was the the the the the the the in in movie
the film has not a money , , he he he just just just just , , but but i i something the the the the the the the the the the the the the the of of of
according loud arthur , , law law law , , , , , and and and other other other
so they saw something magical .
and that found i exciting exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that must to be in in the the the .
so we went in &quot; two two two &quot; , my , , , a further further .
together with the , of we we we the the the of of of of the , , , , , , , , this this
and it worked . again we we created created magical , and the effect in the audience the the the , but but have have little little little little more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more more
from those two experiences experiences , , a new new new world , new new new world of creativity of of .
so i started a company , together with my good friend , , that that time time time time time best best and , , , , &quot; &quot; digital digital digital digital &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea of this company was , to the the the the to with with with with with and and with with with with with
so we we and and and a a a a a a a .
but the the &apos; of 90s 90s , we we that we we in in the the the the the the the the the we we we to to to to to to
i wrote this piece of &quot; &quot; &quot; that that the the in things things things of effects and and in in in in , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
but the top is very back back back and and people in my my my company me that we &apos;t &apos;t to to able able to to . .
so i put that and made this this other film about the ship ship that .
the the of thing i i this , , , and and and a ship ship ship a a a a a a a a a a a . .
but i i wanted to to the real real the the the the titanic titanic
i &apos;ve did the film film .
this is the truth . the studio was not that .
but i convinced have them by , , &quot; we we to to the to to . we the . . . .
we &apos;ll going to show it in the the of the the .
this is incredibly important . it &apos;s a good of for marketing . &quot;
and i recommend them to fund a expedition .
sounds crazy . but that &apos;s back back back that that that can can reality reality reality
we actually created six months later later , in i i in in a a a a a , four miles the the the the the and and and the the the the real real real real
that was not a film , no a , , that was was
so , that really me me up .
and the duration of that were enormous . we had to make and and and everything everything
and i fell to how much these these of , , of of .
well , they were also care , and and more . .
you put going into this this , you you into into this dark dark , , environment where where where where where hope , , , you you &apos;t &apos;t it it it it
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s like as i i in a a .
this is really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with the sea of sea sea
anyway , the part of do with with and science and it was everything was was was was was was was was was was was was was .
and it was a experience that couldn &apos;t give hollywood . .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature , that we could make a visual visual , but i couldn couldn couldn imagine that i i i i i the the
in some of the following session , i &apos;ve seen in in in of of , , , , , i i i never never before before before before before before before before , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
so that &apos;s really really to , , and i i wanted to more more more
and so i met a little unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; &quot; i i i &quot; &quot; okay , i want to to my my a in in in in , , and to to to to a a a . .
and then we started , we went to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and and and with with with with
we &apos;re back to the the the the the the titanic .
we took little robot that we built built a a a a of
our intention was , , the , the the the the the the the the the never never never before before before before before before before before
nobody had the the the of the the of the the the , , had &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t have have that . . . .
now , there &apos;m i , i , the the the the the the titanic the in a , , , , , , , that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that
and i fly with a little of of the the the the the the the
i &apos;m it it , , but my consciousness is within the the .
it felt when i i be physically in the the the the the the titanic
that was the most of of a a a of a that ever ever ever ever before before before i i a a corner , , , , , , , the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
so the the was a a a copy copy of the the of
so that was a very strange experience .
she made aware this this of that that that that that that that that that that that that that the the the the the the of of of of of of of existence existence
it was really really .
and maybe a small view on what might might happen in some decades , if you you to to to to something something something something something things things things things of of of of of of of i i i
after those criteria , we started that we we we , , , really , , , , example example example , , , , we amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing , , , , , , here here here here here here . here . . .
they live with help of the .
they exist &apos;t exist in a on of system , how we do this .
and so you see animals that the right to to to a a 500 that they they can survive survive .
and the same time , i was also very for for of of of that that was was the my my my childhood childhood childhood childhood childhood childhood childhood childhood childhood childhood childhood childhood childhood childhood childhood childhood childhood childhood childhood childhood childhood childhood childhood
and so i ended up the people who in in in the the and and and with and and and and and and and and and and and and and and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was out that that i i to to to the the deep deep deep deep deep deep deep deep deep deep
i took them with and and and to to to to to to the the the the the the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and and and
we was up , , , , science science , , , , , , , ,
so the circle was the my my as my as as as as , , , , and the the the reality reality reality . reality .
in the course of this this , i have a lot lot of .
i learned learned a lot of science . but i think think you to to to a director an , , leader leader leader leader like like like like like like like
but i didn &apos;t know a lot of leadership before i i these these .
because in a particular point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do do ?
why do i do this ? what does it come ? &quot;
these these films are not give us money money .
we &apos;re just play the current of a . of . .
all thinking , i i was between &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to to to the on on on on on beach beach beach beach
i all have these films , these these , for a a very small audience .
no no , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing to the the the the to to challenge challenge challenge the the the the the the the the the the the the the that that that &apos;s the the the of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of
because we &apos;ve done all this with with 10 12 people people years years years years years years years we two two two two months . . .
and in this community , you see that the most important thing is that the thing that you have have have have because because have have have have you you you &apos;t &apos;t
if you go back to land , , , , we we to do it , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
there &apos;s a connection , a a respect .
so when i go back to turn my next film &quot; &quot; &quot; , i i the the same , that that that team team team team team and to to respect respect respect respect respect respect respect respect respect respect . respect . . respect . . respect
so the dynamic was really changed .
so , was i with a little little on on on on on on , , we we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new new new that that that . . .
incredibly exciting .
a tremendous challenge .
and we were to to a of of of of of years . .
so , changed kind of , , , , , , .
there were people who were , we we have have to to to to to the the the the the the the the the the
for me , it was more a a of of , , job job job , , , that that that the the the .
so what can we close from all of all
what lessons we we learned ?
i think the first the , curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can can make a reality .
and the conversations of your teams is more more than all of the world world
to me me young young , , say , &quot; give give give me me me like i i can do something . &quot;
and i say , &quot; you don &apos;t you yourself yourself .
it &apos;s a to you you you you you &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t yourself yourself yourself , , , , but but but but take . . . .
nasa has a a a : &quot; &quot; failure is not not . .
but in art , in the , failure to to be an alternative alternative because because &apos;s a a .
no important tendency , innovation innovation innovation , ever ever without risk .
you have to be ready to take such risks to to .
this is the thought i &apos;d to to you to to the way to , is is is a alternative alternative alternative fear , , , , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
today i &apos;m talking to you about about energy and climate .
and that may probably surprised because because because my my my the the foundation foundation foundation , and and and that that that we we we we we the the the the two billion billion billion billion better better better better better better better better better better better better
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even even more more than each other other planet planet planet planet
so , means that that that that not not not grow grow to years years years , , , to too too too , , , , things things things to to to to can can can their environment environment environment environment environment environment
it leads to to it it it it leads leads leads leads leads leads leads leads . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
so , will change change change to for for . .
and also , the the important for for for important . .
the fact is that if you could just reduce from one one one the price , to be energy energy energy energy the .
now , the most thing is about time time .
in fact , the most powerful on on on on
the the of the the industrial revolution revolution and the the the 20th century , the a a a in the the the the the the and we we we we we we we we , , , do do do do do do do
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s take the price -- -- we we a a new new and and and with with with with with with with with
co2 is the planet and the equation for co2 is actually pretty clear .
they &apos;re the the of co2 , which which leads leads to to to and and and and and , effects effects effects effects effects effects the the the the the the the the the the the the that that that that that that that that that that that
now , the same context between a a of and and and of and and where where where where where are are there there there , but but but but but not not . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
and there &apos;s certainly , about how bad these are going , , but &apos;re be be be . .
i asked asked the the the times , , , we to to to to to to to zero zero zero
not half half or or a quarter ?
the answer is , until we to zero zero to will temperature temperature to to .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than say , we have a a meter high high high high that a a three a , , you you can can you you of of of
this is to to to to to zero zero zero
now , we &apos;re going to a a lot of of of of of of of of of of of of
everybody americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than than .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons of every on on planet .
and somehow we to to changes that that that on zero zero zero
it &apos;s been up .
just different economic changes , it all all and and we to to to to to to to to to to to to zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero
this equation has four factors . a little bit of more of of . they they have this thing thing -- -- -- -- to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to the the the the the the the the the
so let &apos;s look at each factor of the and and we we we we to zero zero zero
probably one of these numbers to to to to to to zero .
now that is fundamental primitive , but we &apos;re it it .
we we we the population population
today today are billion billion people .
and it &apos;s going nine billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion billion
if we could very successful with new new , the the of , , we we we we we to to percent percent percent percent percent , , but but , , , . . . .
the second factor are the services we we use .
this is all that food food we eat eat eat clothing , , , , .
these are very good things and and means means , these these these to to every every planet planet
it &apos;s great that these number goes .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could we make , and less , , but average average average , , to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to the the the the the the the the
here we see a very basic service . there &apos;s home home , so you can read the homework ?
and these students didn &apos;t have it , so you go out and read read your your the the
now , in efficiency , e e the energy per a , , , &apos;s &apos;s good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t going to
because different successes in the the of the the , , other other other ways new ways ways ways ways , , , many many , , , , , , of of of of of .
in other other , , the of of of of , , , , , : : : : : : : : : : : : , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , of of of
and , we we optimistic optimistic we maybe get a a a a or or maybe maybe factor factor factor factor factor factor
but at the first three factors , we &apos;re now now now billion billion maybe billion billion billion billion and and and &apos;s not not not not not not
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is be be be be -- -- that that of amount amount of co2 of of of of
it turns the question whether you can get that on zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn gas gas no .
almost every single of for electricity , , , co2 , , , renewables energy energy energy .
so , what we need to do on a global level , is a new new system .
we need the need of . .
now , if i use the term &quot; wonder , i i &apos;t &apos;t the impossible .
the archive is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and the services is a miracle .
people here have to the the of of of of of .
there &apos;s not a that you need a wonder to a a a date date .
you you you just just just and some some some other other other
but in this case , we have to give the , of a a a a a a a . . . . . . . .
now , i asked myself how can i really get this ?
there &apos;s a natural circuit , a demonstration that that idea idea of people here here
i remembered i , i i i i i and and people people people people .
the idea was really really for you , you know that that are who who who with . .
for energy , i was this one .
i decided that the the the of of of of my my be be to to . .
so here &apos;s a few natural natural .
you &apos;ve me that they don &apos;t &apos;t them . actually they not not not to to the glass .
now , there are all sorts of of of of these , , , but but &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t
we need solutions , either a or a of of of of and and and and and and though there there there of of are are are , , , , , , , , , , , , , that big . . .
i have the , , , , , and and and .
so may this a a deeper deeper and if you afford better than than i , , , , , , but , , , , , we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we ,
let &apos;s look at the fossil fossil fuels , , from of or gas gas gas gas gas gas gas gas gas gas gas gas gas gas gas gas gas gas gas gas gas gas gas gas gas gas gas gas
what you have to do there , maybe , , , , but it it not it it to to to to to to to to to to to to , , , , , , , , , , , , and and and and and and and
there are some of of that that that that to 60 60 percent percent percent percent percent , but percent to to to to to to to to to to to a a , , , , , , , , , , , the the the the the
who will it sure ? ?
who can recommend what literally a lot billion times times than than of of of of that you can can of of of of things things
this is a lot of of .
so that is a hard of .
next : the .
and has has three big problems problems the cost cost , in in in in in in , , , , that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that not not not not not not not not
and what do you do with the waste ?
because even though he &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of thinking .
so three very difficult problems that may may are , and you you work work work work
the last three of five five i have . .
it &apos;s the economic , as they often often called .
and also the , -- even it it it it that they &apos;t &apos;t need need have have have have have .
one is the greenhouse that are these technologies technologies technologies are than than the
these are the , of , you you about about about of of of more more more more more more normal normal
and , these sources are are .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem the whole day , they doesn &apos;t seem to day every day and and wind wind wind wind wind wind wind
so you have to go , you you on on these sources , , way way way energy energy energy times they they they not available .
so there are great big of the there there there challenges challenges the the the , , we we we we the the the the the the country country , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , the the the
and there &apos;s the most powerful thing .
and to show the dimension , i all all all kinds of of that that that made , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
so we need a big breakthrough , something that is be be a a 100 100 than than than the the .
this is not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
this happens happens happens you you try to to these these these of of of percent percent percent percent percent percent percent percent
if you want to take about 100 percent of it , you need a incredible incredible .
now , where do we go , what is the right approach ?
a manhattan project &quot; ? how do we come to the goal ?
what we need are many companies that are working that . . .
in every of these five areas , we need least 100 . .
you &apos;re going you you are are are ! ! good good .
i think here &apos;s the ted the the there there there there already already already already
bill big has several companies , under another called called called called the the great great
and , , of , , companies companies companies companies companies things things things things things things and and and and try to . .
nathan myhrvold and i &apos;m a company that , , , , , the the . .
there are some innovation in the the in the the , , , . .
the development has stopped in this industry in few few time time , &apos;s &apos;s a a surprise a a of of .
the most thing thing that you you instead of of of of of the the the the the the the the the , , , , to to to 99 99 99 99 the the the the
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been about long , , but you but never , , if it it it work work , , but but but , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , it
and because you &apos;re this 99 percent , , is the more more more better .
in fact , you &apos;re the the garbage , and you can even use the waste of the today today today
instead of break the head head head , , it it just . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
the imitation is going to , , a little bit like a .
you see that it is a kind of pillar , often as as &quot; &quot; wave .
this is really the the thing thing .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in philadelphia .
this is the waste that the 99 percent . you have the part , that &apos;s going to to , , it it called called called
the the the the the of hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re cheap , and and and , , you get get get get fuel the the the the the the the the
you know , there &apos;s many challenges there , , but &apos;s a example of of many of of of that we we to to to .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
how should our worldview look ?
now , we go to to the goal that we need to to and and we about about about the the .
many talk of a 80 percent percent to 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest 20 percent percent are being in poor countries , and and still something , , hopefully hopefully hopefully to to to to to to to to to
so , reach these 80 percent , the world have have have , , , , , , , , their their
the other grade says whether we we use the technology technology , whether whether in in in in in and and we we the the the to the the to the rest rest
this is great important .
this is going to a a of of this of of
if we go back to how , how the look look look
it should be the two elements elements
we should use the most of to to reduce the the way the the less less less we we more more more more , , the the the the the the the the the temperature
but actually , this note for the things that we we that &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t not to the the the , , , , , or something something something something , the the the the the the the the of of these these these
this neighborhoods have to do with with with with and we we can can measure measure measure in in in in in in in in in in
there are many great books to this topic .
the al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david david &quot; &quot; &quot; air air air air air air air air air air air air air air air air
they really go it through and create a a , that that can be , , , because because we we need of all all all all all all
there are some lot of has to together together .
this is a wish .
a very drug desire that we invent this technology .
if you just just me a wish for for next 50 years years years , could could choose a , , , and i i i i i i wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish wish , , , , , , , to to to to
this is the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the the , the the the between the and and of people people people the between between between china china china poor poor poor poor and and and and and and and of of of of of of
so what do we need to do ?
for what , , i ?
we need to use more more more more more .
if countries are in places like the like , , shouldn &apos;t not about about about about .
they should talk this these these of and and they they they be be be the the of of that that that these these . . . . .
we need a , of , , , , , , , amp amp amp ; , that a a a
we need to spread the message .
we need to make the and and and and and and things things that the the government government government government government
it &apos;s a important wish , but i think we can make it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . just about understand something more better better better -- , you you you a of of of of of of of investment investment investment investment
bill gates : to make the simulation on a a , all , , , , , we we we we we we we we 10 10 10 and and even even we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we in
the hard step is building building the first first of the the the the the the the the the the the the of of of of of
once the first finished is , when he &apos;s as as , , , , , all , because because because the the the is is is is is than as as as we we know .
so understand that right , that means is to building the ground the the the a a a of of , , , , and and and then process process then process and the the to to down
so , , , , , , , you you to to to to to , , , , so many many many many many many many many , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can put it for 60 years years -- you you -- -- -- -- -- they without without all whole whole .
and it &apos;s sitting and and 60 60 years years and and it it .
a a of that is a solution solution for for the
so , : : , , , , , , what what what what you you you you you you it it &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- , it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it
and we start to take by waste waste that already already already that in in these of of of of of of of the the the is is is our our
so this is what this for for these , problem that which we we we into our and and the the the the the this this this process process process process process process
but as they &apos;ve about with people of these world world these these about .
where is the biggest interest , what what really do ?
so , , we we we we we we &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t place place place place place a a a interesting interesting interesting interesting of of of of of of the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something in the direction direction .
this is a a of one thing that made done
this is a important step step forward , it it &apos;s a a faster and and some countries these built that that that &apos;s a a a a a a a a of for for our our
in their idea , and and and of to to to to to to life
so , , we we we need of of of of of of of of of , , , , , very very , , , , 20 20 20 years years years years years years years years
this is kind of the that that us us us the the we we we need to .
and , you know , , , , , , , , , , , , , a , , , , , , , , . .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies companies companies and we need hundreds of , , , , , , work work work work work work for for for for for for
and it would be the best , it it several , because because you you a a a .
we &apos;s need a solution . .
and the big amount of sizes , is is this the biggest that you know ?
the , a is is is is is important important important important
it would be been it without without the the , but but but it it more much more more more
in nuclear sector , there are other other companies .
you know , we know &apos;t know your work as this , but there &apos;s the the method , that &apos;s a way .
there &apos;s a liquid of that which seems seems seems seems to , but sometimes that that about us us us
and so there &apos;s different , but the beautiful thing is is is a a a a a times much much much , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
if that doesn &apos;t work what what ?
do we have to put to to to to to to to to the the
so , , you you you you you you this this this , , , you you you you you you you , , and and and and and and , you you you you you you you you you you you a a or or
there is a infinite that is called to that that with with with different techniques to to to to to , , 20 30 30 30 30 years years years years
this is just a a of .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say you you &apos;t &apos;t work work work the the because because that that may be , so so you you you because because that that that that that the the the
i don &apos;t know if the smart is , you you to to the the importance of of problem problem , but &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s a in in of of of if if if if if if if that if , , , , , , , , ,
change change : have you a or or two sentences to to you you ?
so , , , , , , , , , the in different different different different different
those who are scientific scientific , , very little .
tell , there &apos;s negative implications , do have do with clouds clouds that things things ?
there are very , very few things that you can say say , that that a chance chance chance a a .
the the here is so similar as aids .
you &apos;re now mistakes , , and you you pay for for much . .
and so the idea , now , , you you all all sorts of of of of , , something something something something , , , what what , that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that
the fact is that these uncertainty should worry worry .
but my dream here is that if you can make it , , and the same same , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , not not not not not not it not it it it it
and that would be their answer to the the of the the the the that that that you use use use and and solve solve solve solve the the the the the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
so , the , , , the the the the the the the the the the the the the the 10 10 per per than than than than than -- -- -- not not not not not not not . .
under should &apos;t &apos;t other other things . .
you &apos;ll going to big big , and and can can can people people you you something that that not not , , and to to to to to to to me of of of
it &apos;s because , you &apos;re very short a a a a and and and the the learning learning learning , i i we we we we we to to to to to much much much much much much much much
if the the of , you you you , a very high high high high , , , can the the the
i mean , everybody of us could be five five so for for for for for for for for .
but the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even , about about about . .
his new of is is , &quot; why is not the about about about ? &quot; &quot;
he &apos;s still going to , because of of former stories stories , , the , , , but but that that that a very very very is is &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s
and that is a stick i i think for for .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , like little little is . .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about almost all people people , i i i i &apos;m &apos;m hope you wish to to to you you thank thank you much much much much much much
thank you . thank you .
some few years ago , here ted ted , , peter peter peter a called called called &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . the the of the the the the the with 20 20 20 , 20 , , , , , , , a a a . . . .
the marshmallow has to be up up .
and , though it really seems to it it it really hard hard because because &apos;s &apos;s to to to quickly . .
and so i thought that this is interesting interesting idea and and i it it into a a a .
it was a huge success .
since since , i &apos;ve about 70 70 the world world , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , to to to to to
usually the people people to to to to to the .
they talk about it , you think about how it will going to it it to to
then they &apos;re a little bit time care care and and and and they and and and .
they &apos;re a a of of time time time the the time time
and finally , shortly before you have &apos;t time time time time , somebody somebody the and and you you it to to to to to to , , , , , , , , , , &quot; &quot; &quot; . .
but what , , , , , is that that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the because the the the the the the the the the the thing thing thing
there are a series of people who have much more more more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than than , , , the the the the the the
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re really confused and produce and . .
and of course , there are teams more more more more more &quot; &quot; &quot; the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as us told , they &apos;t &apos;t just the the highest , , but but the most of of of of .
what you might ask questions , is is how does ? ? ? ? what ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
and peter said , &quot; no of kids kids children to be time the the the the the the
they &apos;re &apos;t invest time in in in in
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that &apos;s that that that , to to to find a a right right right right right right right right right
and then then . .
what happens happens if you put the marshmallow on the top , you have have have time time and what happens ? ? ? ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar what ?
what &apos;s the do is is that that you start to the the the and and , , , , , the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the of the
and , of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of
and with each try , kids kids kids kids , what what what what not
so the performance is to work with with , , -- , see see see how teams teams teams .
the average for most of the about about the , , , , , , of , , , , , , , , , , more more more more more more than than than adults adults adults
who is the successful successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
so is the highest , what i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they &apos;re triangles and and and are patterns the the the the the to . . .
dry are something about average . but here &apos;s going . . .
you &apos;s a a a the the the the , , you more . .
it &apos;s incredibly . you see around and see this this this this win &quot; &quot;
you can predict that predictions . why that ?
because they have special skills of the the of .
they &apos;re going to process the process , you understand .
and this team , that is and and the work work the the the the of of team team
and skills and and and and of their to to to .
if you have 10 teams , the typical , , you get about six , the the the . .
i tried to do something kind . .
i thought we bring the the the thing .
so i painted a fifth dollars price software software for the cents .
what do you believe with these these of ?
what was the result ?
this is happened . not a team a a a .
if someone built built a high high construction construction , , would would to to price to
so is it not interesting that high high high a a effect effect effect
we studied this practice with the same students .
now what do you do ? ?
now you understood the advantage of the &quot; . &quot;
so , the the the , , , of of of the .
they made the highest construction in the least time .
so there are the of of us for us , about nature nature of and success .
they may ask why why would actually invest a a a a a ?
the reason is , i &apos;m digital digital tools and and to teams teams teams cars games games games games games and &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what the the thing thing is is , they them them them them them
because open , , project project has his his own . .
the challenge gives a common experience , a common language or a , of the the the .
and this is the value of this experience , this so simple practice .
and these of you that &apos;s interested in , , , to .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how you build the the .
there &apos;s a a of there there
they find crazy examples of all world world , people system system system system and and
there &apos;s also a of of
and the most lesson lesson , i think is is actually a construction a a a .
it &apos;s that we all all our senses senses the task task task and we we we thinking thinking thinking our our our our , , , , , that that . . .
and sometimes a little prototype of of experience , everything everything needs needs needs us us us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
we we do this we we we a machine .
a big machine , a cool , , machine , , that is a a machine .
and everybody in this room has to be in
and you can go in the past , you can go in the future ; they can &apos;t go in the and now now now now
and i ask what you would choose , i i often my my my last last last last , , and wanted wanted to to to to the the past
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to time before before cars cars cars or or or or the the the the the the
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that you &apos;re to to to to to to to .
and that understand .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i must to say .
i don &apos;t want to go in the past , and that doesn &apos;t , because i &apos;m a .
it &apos;s that possibilities to go this planet planet , , go go . .
so i want to go in this machine , and i want to go in the future .
this is the biggest time that was the on on planet planet , , matter matter , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
there was never a time like this .
my favorite of died all were they 60 60
my grandparents is this number on the
my parents are the 80 on the most of the
so there &apos;s be better nine nine of of of of of of
but it &apos;s not even people people , , this is is bigger bigger than that .
a child that &apos;s born in delhi in delhi , , , as long long as the the the the the the the the
think about this . this is a incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . smallpox have billions billion people people on planet planet .
they &apos;ve created the the of the earth on a way way it it &apos;t &apos;t ever ever .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we have them . . . .
in the rich world , diseases , the millions of us have been been of of of , , even even . .
the , , , , , , , , , ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
anybody anybody anybody that that that that ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions people people are are of scientific scientific .
and from my view , the scientific method , things trying to look , , it it works it it it it it &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s of of of of of of of humanity
so that is the good news .
unfortunately , this &apos;s the whole good news , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they they often mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all of our our billion billion billion people on the every every every day .
this number goes , and it &apos;s very very quickly and and that &apos;s . .
and not only that we we we our imagination to to the world world .
water , , , , , , oil , gas : : they , and and and and we we we we &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t chaos we chaos we . . .
so the question is : we can do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will to to people people without without country country country live live . . . .
i think we can do this world with energy , that they &apos;t same same same same time
i think that really , , and , that &apos;s not a a .
but this is what me me to night day one of of of things things that night night night , we we never we never never never never never never never never never never never never never never never never never never never never never never never never never
and we were never able to it it , , , , we we we we it .
we &apos;re to to to amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing in many many places , and i i i i we we to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to we we we we we we we we we
people are going to their their faith , and and so so that you you &apos;t &apos;t .
not even the truth will going . .
and listen , everybody has a right on his opinion , even a right on the opinion progress progress progress
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
they don &apos;t have right on their own own . &quot; , , don &apos;t &apos;t .
and i needed a while to out out out .
about about decade decade , i &apos;ve a paper about about the the the new new new new , , article article .
and i was amazed to be on resistance , on resistance on on what the the the the the the the the the in history history history history history
i didn &apos;t know what i should do , so i did i i i i i i i i i i and and .
and soon , i wrote a article about about about . .
the same thing , just bigger .
people played crazy .
so i &apos;ve wrote about a article , and i couldn &apos;t understand why why people thought would would be be &quot; &quot; &quot; , , of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i was on .
i mean , i &apos;m journalist ,
we &apos;re , we we we we we we we food that that .
but this article was worried , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and and and and found out out
and that is that these these that were were were all all all all . .
that were the people people people people people people people people people people
they were exactly like people in this room .
and that brings me so so
but then i thought , know know what , we honest honest honest
we &apos;re on a point that we we &apos;t have the same relationship for progress as .
we &apos;re talking about this of . .
we &apos;re talking to , with little little little about : &quot; &quot; &quot; .
okay , there &apos;s reasons , and i think that know what that are . .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , in science , , there no no reason why why why be be be be
you can just call a few names names and people understand understand .
and , the the , the the , , , , , , , , , ,
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people that we that they they always always . . . . . . .
imagine ask , you you evidence , you you . .
take &apos;t take anything . .
but now , it &apos;s you you you you you you you you evidence evidence , and &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re not . .
and i can tell that from the reason that we now in a epidemic of fear fear , i never never never never never never never never . . .
about 12 years ago , a story published published a a story , that the the the the the the the , , , , , , , , , , in
very frightening .
and studies were done to see whether that true .
and studies should be done ; that is a serious . .
the data came in .
the data came in the united states , from england , from sweden , , canada , and they were all all same , , , , no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
it doesn &apos;t make difference difference it it doesn &apos;t make difference difference because we we think , , we think we we we we we we we we we we we we . . . . .
we don &apos;t believe in a a knee of a a , that gives us us us and i i i i i that all all . .
but you know what ?
the result of it was , .
namaste because of this fact : the u.s. states one one one the only countries the the world the the the . .
this is a , of we we we we we .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happens that we could do that .
well , i understand this . i do .
because anybody somebody somebody ?
has one one the audience audience audience audience audience in in
not often .
in this country country , , , , , , the the the the the last last
these are many death through the , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not here here , we can can it it , and people people can can can and and and and and and and and and and and and and and king king . . .
and that can do you because they don &apos;t work and and industry industry .
you don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be same , but almost almost same same .
and that is something that we need learn learn and and &apos;s very . .
this guy was a hero , jonas . .
he &apos;s going us of of of worst worst the of
no fear , no a , 15 , , , travel .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t much much .
he &apos;s called paul .
he &apos;s been developed a few few people people people .
he can save the life of the , , children children per year year the world
pretty good , not ?
now , this is good , besides that paul paul and about about and and how how how how valuable , and people people stop stop stop stop . .
and that actually tells that .
so paul is a experimental .
if paul talk about a public of , , it &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t without without . .
he gets calls to home because people like to tell him that they know where children children children school .
and why ? because paul has a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
you you you , , , the back , diseases terrible terrible , and and happens happens .
we &apos;ve now in in this country .
and that &apos;s going to be , and and soon soon soon to to , because because because a a a of . . . . . . . . . . . .
and they &apos;re not just die to die . .
what about 15 ? take we take that why why not
a a of of me me written a few few weeks weeks and i i i i a little bit bit . .
nobody has ever ever before .
they wouldn &apos;t have your child against for . . . .
ooh .
why ? because we don &apos;t have 15 . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have in this country in .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe i someone someone in in in in in a a and fly fly fly los los angeles , , , , , . . .
and in a few hours , he he and and car car car car car and and long long long long long long and and to to to to to to to to to to to to to . .
and he doesn &apos;t know he &apos;s infected with a a disease disease , and we we &apos;t know know because because because world world world
this is the planet that we live live . do don &apos;t &apos;t as as it it &apos;s not
we love to to to in , . we love . .
do you all all all their their their
and , a of of a a little of of of of of you you to to . .
i know they did that because because half of americans the every every day day
they take the stuff , and they take alternative alternative , and it doesn &apos;t &apos;t difference difference how often often find they &apos;re . .
the data is the constantly . .
they &apos;re their their . more do they never .
this is okay , you want to be 28 billion dollars for for for . .
i &apos;m them to . .
dark nanometers . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the private .
we hate a strong government . we we &apos;t have trust trust the . .
and that should &apos;t do . our health system is is .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold , and to to to that that that afford afford
so we &apos;re going away away , and where go we ?
we walk going the poor poor the poor the
this is great . i love the most thing .
but you know , this &apos;s really a serious issue , because stuff stuff is crap , and we we billion dollars of .
and i all have all of of little . .
none of them -- , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , it it it it it it it it it it it it
and you know what ? if i say that , , me people people people , &quot; &quot; what what what what do do do do do do do do do . .
so you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s the health health , , , says says &quot; , , i &apos;m going to to to of of of of of of of of of of of of patients patients patients patients patients patients patients patients patients patients patients patients
if you &apos;re going to go on this path where and and and and and and , , , to place place place you you &apos;t &apos;t want
they get to to the the south south south south africa africa
he brought 400,000 of his people , because he was was that that red red red , , , , more more more more more effective effective effective that that that that that that that that of of of of
hundreds hundreds of of death in a country , that worse worse than any of of of disease disease disease
tell me tell that that things things don have have consequences consequences
they have them . they always always .
now , the most of epidemic , we we we is is is this is of struggle between between the the the the and the the the the
this is a a debate debate . you must to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphor .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we we food , every every every every every every , , every every , , , people people people people people people
you know , there were no a in in in .
there was no a of .
there was no a of . we we all all .
we did done it in the last last .
and some of them has works and and not &apos;t .
we &apos;re more , what doesn work work .
now we can do it it , and and of course , &apos;s &apos;s risks but but we can something a a a , , , , , people people people people people people people people people people people people people people
do &apos;t you want do do you ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand that .
we &apos;re going to have food food food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m hear about , , many chemicals chemicals , , , , , , , , , , want , , , with with with that that . . . . . .
we don &apos;t want companies live life . .
we don &apos;t want companies that have have .
and you know what my answer on all all this ?
yes , you &apos;re right . we we this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge of of , but but &apos;s not not science .
that has nothing do do do with .
it &apos;s quite , morality , , , ,
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not country country .
it &apos;s not even a idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes he works and sometimes sometimes not but but idea idea we we should allow to to to work work because because because because because because because because , , , , , , , of of of of of
you know , in the next 50 years , we have to grow 70 70 more food than than than . .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
beethoven . beethoven .
they need that , and we &apos;re &apos;t give them .
and why ? patents changed food food
we don &apos;t want people to eat people this this of , , , , like , , example
and , is something that a a billion billion people .
it &apos;s about a a .
it &apos;s just a a calories calories . it &apos;s &apos;s .
it doesn &apos;t have a , it doesn &apos;t build a protein , and scientists all all this in this .
and then the people could be food and would not be be .
they wouldn &apos;t , , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be a , , but it be be .
and everything i can say is is is why why we that ?
i mean , ask we : why why we we that ?
because we don &apos;t want genes to gene ?
it &apos;s not about genes , , it &apos;s not not chemicals chemicals
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our our of the on food food food food food .
it &apos;s not about dinosaurs , , &apos;s about to to people people , , , and it it to to to understand what what means means means means means means
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that if we do doing so so do we do do we we we we we we we we , , , , , , , , , , , . . . . .
there &apos;s no other description for what happens here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not our , , and we need need to to to .
so after this incredible funny conversation , you you want say say say you want want to to to in in in in in the the the the the &quot;
on every , i want to to i every . .
now , moment you in in the present , but we have incredible incredible opportunity .
we can make these little machine on everything we we we .
we can break them where we want to break them , and we &apos;re going to move where where we . .
we need to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but we we we to into the the the the the the we we we we to to . .
i know we can , , and as as as it it is is that that the the the needs now
thank you .
thank you .
since some time , i &apos;m interested for the the the the the the , it it strange strange strange strange that that that , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
with other words , sugar , in a a a a a a , , , , , , , , , , , , , , because because is is is is , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
a deception is to something something , because somebody somebody it so .
so we also understand each other , i want want to you you a fundamental , simple simple . .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that is at at the the in in in in for
i &apos;ve learned him him the the the the the the the the the the the the
i &apos;m going to make him for them and and and . .
and then i &apos;ll going to explain why i explain explain .
so , see what happens happens
the knife that can study ; ; my hand , you can study .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my my .
i &apos;m back back back back .
and to get sure that nothing in my my my , or out out out out i i going going going just my my right right right .
so , can can can that that that time time time time time time time as as as i i i can can go go , , .
and the goal is is simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything all , , , going going to through through my my my . .
it &apos;s actually so so his place place that i can i it without without that the hidden
nothing it in my my my or , , , , , , , and can can can . .
the , ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
now , this is a trick i often often little kids kids kids to to in , , , , you can can can can learn about about , , , when you when even even even even even even it a very very very
probably , of of you you here in the the the . .
he works that .
i think that leaves in my hand .
i say i i my my my to to to sure sure that that in in my , , , , , and and and a . .
the reason why i mean my my , is that that that the secret secret of of of illusion .
now , the moment where i i my hand hand of you you you you you you you you , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , where where where where where where in in in
great trick ?
there &apos;s sitting , someone who no no no . .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and if i &apos;m going to change the the the the . . .
and now you could talk about why that is a deception , why you don you &apos;t to to to see here here , , , because because because because , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
but it &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s here here , , , , i i i i . . . . .
of course , there &apos;s going to , , but but by the the of my body , but but through through through my my , , &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s
and if i &apos;m my hand hand , the same thing , , to to to to through through that that that that that the to . .
i &apos;m going to take this hand . and here is the knife .
this trick can show your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what did that do to do with the the ?
and year year , , i read a study study really really really really really .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and so that was a amazing thing thing .
so it turns out out , if you you a a a of form form a a in in in , form form a a a a , , , , , , , , , a a . . . . . .
but if you &apos;re the shape where you give the the , , example example a a a , , , and and and and and and and and , , , actually actually actually . . .
and that &apos;s even of of of of of of of it &apos;s &apos;s just just .
but a white pill is not so good as a blue pill .
what ? that really me me me .
but it turns out that that &apos;s not not .
if you take the , the still effective more more than any .
a colored , that who on on on the yellow and the the the , than than than white white
the the is plays a role .
a pill twice is not so good as three as three -- i can &apos;t remember remember the the the . . sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry
the the key thing , ...
... that the the of play play role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate of the ultimate , you you to to to to needle needle needle
right ? a syringe with a a of a a a a a a a of of of of of you you you a .
this creates a very strong picture in the head . that is very much stronger than than a . .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another different , if we we a a .
so fact fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as as as the the the that that &apos;t as as as as as as as as as as as as as
and nothing of it has really really really of of of , it it &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s us us .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic .
i &apos;m going to take that is is a deception , and and really . .
we know that of study study that you to to to to needle needle if it to to to to .
this is a 18 inches long long of long , it &apos;s very very very very very , and and and and i i a little little bit bit bit bit bit bit .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not a of of of meat meat
this is my skin . this is not a special of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to put this needle in my skin into my skin and through through through to to to other other other other other other
if you &apos;re going to be you you you you fall fall fall -- -- i i a few few last night night night night , and and people i i i i i i i i i and and and and a
so i &apos;m going you you you quickly to to to to you you for the the 30 seconds seconds seconds , , , you , , going going to to the the the the the the
you can see it same , you can can but but you you you you want .
so , it &apos;s so , here where where my meat , , , , , i i i i i i i a a little . . . .
so i really do . makes it crazy crazy
and now , a little little bit through my skin and and the other other other other

there &apos;s very much of of .
everybody would like to do people people .
but despite all of these of , , , there are several cognitive , that that it of of almost , , about happiness happiness . . . .
and my talk today is going going to to to cognitive cognitive cognitive
this is true for the , that about about your happiness happiness , and &apos;s &apos;s for for , about happiness happiness because because that that that &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re as as as other other other
the first of this fall is a a of , , complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is not not useful word , because because we to to to to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could could it it , but but but in big , , , that that we we to we we we we we we we we we we to to to what what is . .
the second case is a a of experience and and , in it &apos;s &apos;s happy happy happy his his his life happy happy happy happy happy life life life life life life life life life
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both both of of of of of happiness happiness
and the third is the the thing , and that is the the fact that we we &apos;t about about about reality , , well-being well-being well-being meaning meaning meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive background .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now i &apos;d like to start with a example of a example who had had a a of of of of of , , , , , , , , , he he he he he he he he he he he he , , , , , ,
and then he added , , really , , , that has the whole experience experience experience
but that didn &apos;t .
what it was was the the the the the experience experience experience
he had had experience experience
he had had 20 minutes minutes of music
they &apos;re &apos;t , because he was with a memory memory ; ; memory was was was , , and and was was was was he to
what &apos;s that is is is that we we think about about about other people in the of of of of of of of .
there &apos;s a a of self that lives in present present present present present present present , to to to to past past past , , but the the present present . . .
it &apos;s the most thing self that the doctor doctor the the , you you know when the the , , , , , , if if i i you you you you
and then there &apos;s a a of self , and the the self self self is is the the the the of of of our , and and and and and and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
or &quot; like was journey journey journey for ? ? or or like .
these are two very different units , the the self self and the the self and and and two two two of of of of of of of of happiness happiness happiness happiness
well , the most thing self is a storyteller .
and that &apos;s really with with basic response response our memories reaction -- it starts starts .
we don &apos;t just tell stories , we we to to stories stories .
our memory tells us stories that means what we we we to our our our . .
and let &apos;s start with a example of a .
there &apos;s a old study .
these are real patients that are a a a .
i &apos;m not going to go to detail detail . it &apos;s not not painful , but it &apos;s painful when was was was the the the the the .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;ll asked , &quot; who who has has more ? ? &quot;
and that is a very simple question .
patient b has has more more . his his was was , and and minute minute of pain , , patient patient patient , , and and and and and .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much thought that patients that they they ?
and here &apos;s a surprise :
and the surprise is that patient is a a more more more more more of the the the the
the stories of the most of were were different , and because a very very part of of , , they they they
and no of these stories is very very very or great -- -- of of of of this clear clear
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the worse that worse is , where pain pain was the the the end on the peak , it &apos;s &apos;s a good .
where do we know that ?
because we asked these people to their their their their , , and , , , , , bad bad was whole whole whole whole whole &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she was a lot worse for a than for in the the the
now , this is a cause conflict between the the self self the the self self self
and the of of the the of obviously b a a a a
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually have actually experiments experiments and and and and and and and and it , , , , , , , , , , , , , , to to to to
that will going to be that patient patient , but but just a little bit bit more less less less less less
and if you do a few minutes minutes you you you that that that the the of of of of of bad bad , , and that that that that that that that a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
so &apos;s a story story story
and that &apos;s true for stories that that that us us and it &apos;s &apos;s for for stories we we we .
and &apos;s story story story story story , , , , , , and . .
end , very , very important and and this case this the end end end end
well , the most thing self life life life life life .
it has moments of the most powerful , one after the other .
and they ask , what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost .
i mean , most moments of our life -- and i &apos;ve the the thing -- you know know the visual present present about about about three three seconds , what what what what what , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
most of you are completely completely by the the self self
and yet , they get kind of the impression that they should count that that during this this the of the the is is is .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we &apos;re during we we the world world .
and as we would use them to important important , but that &apos;s not the story that that the the of of us us . .
so we have the the thing self and and the self and and and and really really quite . .
the biggest difference between them is the deal with time .
from the of of the the , even if you you a a and and and second the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the as as
so , doesn &apos;t work the the the the the .
for the the of self , a a is is more than than than the , , because because because because because because . . .
they didn &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , the is critical critical the that a a a self self self self a a a time time time a little on on story . . . .
now , the most thing self is more more to remember and stories stories
it &apos;s actually actually , that decisions decisions , because you you have patient patient , , we two two two two two two two and and and he he he he he choose he he he he he he he he is is is is is is is
the most thing self has not a voice in this choice .
we &apos;re not choose between sexual . we choose between memories memories experiences .
and even if we think think the future , we think we usually &apos;t future future future future
we think about our future as a as of a .
and basically , you can look at that , you know when a a of of the the , , , and and can can can the the the of of of of of of of of of of of of of self self the the the self
i have the impression that if we do to that often often often often that that that we we we we to the the the the the the the
and that is a little bit to to , , i think .
i mean , how much do we we from our ? ?
this is one of the explanations that will given given to the the of of of
and if i think about about , i think about a invitation that we did done a few years years the the the the best best , i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i think i other other other other
and i probably have from my memories on this this journey , i would say about 25 25 25 minutes minutes last last years years .
now , if i opened the the the the the the the the the in i i i a hour hour
well , these are three weeks , and that are just hours hours .
it seems to give a a .
now , i like a little bit of , , you know know , , little little i i i i of of , , , , , , you you you more more more , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
so i want you to think about a principle .
imagine your next ego , you know that the end end of the the the the the the , and they they get get get a they they they you you you you to to to to to
now , would you choose the same duck ?
and if you would choose another other , there there a conflict between between their of of of and and you you about about how they conflict conflict conflict conflict , , , , , you , , , you , you , , you you , you you
why we choose the the of that we we is is a problem problem that that a a a a of of of of of of of of of
now , the two species of the two two two of happiness happiness happiness
there are actually two concepts of happiness , we can use , one one self .
so you can ask , how happy is the the thing self
and then they would ask , how happy are the moments in life of the the of
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can can measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re now to to a pretty good good idea idea of happiness happiness the the the .
if you ask to happiness happiness the the the , &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s thing .
this is not how happy happy person person person .
it &apos;s how happy or happy , person person person person person person about your life life life
very different term .
everybody who not not going to be the of of of of of happiness , and and i to to of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of
the distinction between happiness of the the self self self the happiness self self the the the the the the the the the , , , , , to to to to to to
the main of the has has a survey survey , the the more more than a people people people about about about about about about about life life life and and and and and and and and other other .
so in the last years , we started learning learn happiness of of of of of of self
and the main lesson that we think , think , learned that you &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy somebody is with his life , and that &apos;s really &apos;t &apos;t much much how how happy life life life life and and .
just to give you a impression of the industry industry that is is about about about of
what is that mean that if you meet meet someone and you you you you , , , , , a a a a a , , how you you know know know know know
now , you would know something about his size , but there &apos;s much uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone somebody his life than eight eight a a of of of 10 of of of how how how happy happy happy happy with with his
so the industry is small .
we know something what the happiness of the the the .
we know that money very important important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is means be be be with people people we we spend spend spend spend we we . .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s infinite .
so if you want to be the happiness of of of of of of of , , you to to to very different different
the conclusion of what i told here that that we we &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t a a a for for for . .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , very short , a reason reason reason we we we think about about happiness happiness we we we we we the same same we we we we we we we we we live live live live live live live live live live live live live live live
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are are in california they they &apos;re not the the to .
if you think think this question , you think that to to to to to to , , , , , , , in in . .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , , think the the the the and other other other and and and , , , , , , , , climate climate climate climate climate climate climate climate climate climate climate climate climate climate climate
now , it turns out that climate not not important important for the the , , it it &apos;s not even even important important for the the the , people people people people happy people people people . .
now , because the is self responsible responsible , you can can the the the -- people the the the the the
and it &apos;s kind of to interesting what happens happens people people to to to to to to to to . .
now , you &apos;re not going to be happier happier . .
we know that .
but one thing is happen . you &apos;ll think you &apos;re &apos;re happier happier because because &apos;re &apos;re about about about it about to to to to the the the the the the the the the the the they they they they they they they
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being about well-being , and hope hope you you a sense of how how it it it .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question on them .
thank you .
now , when we have a few weeks weeks weeks , they they me that that was was was interesting interesting interesting that that that came of of
is that something that can can us us us us because because you a few few minutes
daniel &apos;s : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the the survey survey is a number number we we we &apos;t &apos;t to to .
we found that in the of happiness the the the self self
if we looked at how emotions with with with income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars in year , , and that is a very big of of of , , but it it &apos;s but but but &apos;s a a a a a a a of of dollars dollars dollars dollars
60,000 .
so , 60,000 .
60,000 dollars in year are people unhappy , and they &apos;re increasingly more more more , , they they . .
we get a absolutely flat line .
i mean , i rarely have so flat lines .
what happens is is that money money a a a , but but but but but of money of , , , , and and and and , , , very very very very very . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
in the sense of the other self , the the self self , you get a story .
the more money you made it , you you
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
but danny , in the entire american of , it &apos;s about , , freedom , to to . .
if people would take this this of of , , , , , , , to to to to to to to to everything everything , think think think think in terms on on on on on on on
there &apos;s a chance that politicians , that country country is a a a a of serious serious serious serious and to to
so , you you you , , , think that that &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s the the the the the the the of politics politics politics politics politics politics politics politics politics politics
the recognition is going to be be in the united states , not question , but in the the kingdom , , you happening happening in in . .
people are , , , they should think think think think think think politics politics .
it will take a while while , and people people people to to whether whether whether want to to to to whether to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to
as you can get happiness , very very on on , you you think you think you think the the the the or or or or think think the the the the the the the
it will going to , , , think think , the the . .
in the united states , you &apos;re going to measure the the the of the population population population population population
this is going to think i think , the the next next or two two of of of of of
now , it seems me me this this topic , or should least least the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
thank you for much for the invention of the .
thank you , danny . .
i &apos;m jane goodall . i &apos;m design .
i &apos;ve been using for for 10 years years and and and goal for for for , , , , , , , to to world world world world world world world to . . .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince more people , , , more time time with the and and and and .
now we spend three billion hours hours week week week week
some of you may think , &quot; this is a whole bunch time for games . &quot;
maybe something lot time time time time you you about many many problems problems problems problems problems problems the real world world world
but in fact , my research research the the to the future to the the the the the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not even enough enough solve the the problems problems the world .
in fact , i convinced that if we want to to the next century on this planet , we we to increase time time .
i have that that the needed time in in billion hours hours hours week week week
so that may be something something , , , i i i it it it it it can can we we , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , to to to to to to to to to to
no , i really mean it seriously .
why ? this picture describes quite exactly why i think that games games games for the survival the the the the the the the the . . . .
this is a a of the syndrome .
he wanted to play the feelings in play , so he has built a a a camera .
this is one of the classic processes in play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you may get a of of the the the in in .
you probably see this sense of for , something fear , , but but but , , , , , , the the a problem problem problem problem problem problem problem problem
if you &apos;re play , you see some of of here that that on on the the the the the the the of of of of of of of surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise surprise . . . . . surprise surprise surprise surprise
this is a player that is on the edge of a of called
oh , you know that . ok . so . so we have some players here here
a a of victory is a result that is so so powerful that that they &apos;t &apos;t know that that was possible possible possible possible possible possible
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you reach it , they &apos;re shocked , they &apos;re actually to to that something something that that is a a . .
this player is short a a a of .
and this is what we have to see on millions of of of of the the world world world we we the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the of of of of of
well , unfortunately we we see this this face in real real life if we we problems problems problems
i call it as &quot; in life i i &apos;m bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , and and and &apos;s my my , , , , ? ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok
i &apos;m what i &apos;m i i &quot; in life i i i i &quot; &quot;
this is a symbolic in my former home in berlin , california , california where where i in in in in in we in in real real real real real real real .
this is a problem that have a lot of players .
we think we &apos;re not not in good good as as play play play
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even that &apos;s about .
we &apos;re going to get more in more more , i i my my my the the the the the , , , , , , , to to . . . .
if we &apos;re in a a of , i think that many of of us us our our our , , , , , , , , , , to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to
and in reality reality if we fail , if we we to to to , we we often often often often . .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel us . we we we we feel feel , depressed , or or or or .
we &apos;ve have we we we play play play play play , it not not not .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a student .
why is it impossible in play , you could &apos;t do do all all ?
how can we make these feelings from play play in reality ?
so i looked at the like world of of of of that the ideal ideal to the the .
and i &apos;ve found some things that the the the in in in in
so , first , you you &apos;re to in one of of of of of of , , world world , , , of of of of of , are , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . .
but not only any mission , but a mission that is to their their their their of in game game right right right right right right right
so they do that .
they never get a task that they can &apos;t solve .
but always the the edge of their skills , so you have to do to it , but there no not in in of of of of .
you &apos;re not around around and it it &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s important important important important important
and there are a employees of
where they &apos;re go , hundreds of people people who with with with with their their their mission mission
so have &apos;t have that in life life life that that feeling feeling that that a a a of of of
and also , there are this this story , these story , why we are and we we we do do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this constant feedback is not in the real life .
if i get this stage , i i &apos;t , , , , a a a a a a idea idea idea crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy
i don &apos;t get in the this life this feedback feedback
so , the problem of the world of the world is is is that that is so so to to the the the of of of of of that we we we we we time time time time time time . .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today all all world world of of of of of , , of of of of of of problems problems problems problems problems problems problems problems problems
this is not necessarily something bad .
it sounds sounds a .
but to see it in context context : the years ago ago ago started started started first first first first
so the first band electrons .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend with play play , , , , , , when when time time time time the of of of of of of of of of of of is is is . .
but also , it it turns out out that we using using all all all time time the , change change change change change we are are . .
we &apos;re us to to , , , . .
this is the truth . i think i .
at at this interesting interesting statistics that recently recently by by a of of carnegie the the the the the of of of of in a a a a with with with with with with with with with with hours the the
so 10,000 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , two two reasons reasons
first of all , for children the the united states the the the the the the are are they they they they in the the school school school school school school school school school school school school school school . .
so we have a full of of , , the the young young people people people , , , , a good good , , , , , , , , they learn learn . . . .
and maybe some of you have the new book of photographers , , &quot; &quot; &quot; . .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success of the days hours .
they &apos;s based on the great research of the the research of the the , , we 10,000 10,000 hours hours the of of of of of of of to to to to to to to to . . . .
we &apos;re going to do so well what what what the the most people people the the world world
so , what we have here is a whole generation young young who are are the .
so the big question is : &quot; what are are players are ? ? &quot;
because if we could figure out , we would have have of of of of of of potential potential . .
so many people have now now in the world world that least least a a a day with with with with
these are our our of . 500 million people people extraordinary extraordinary in in &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the next decade we we have another billion player , which extraordinary good in what are are .
if you haven &apos;t heard it ,
the most powerful is developed the the energy energy energy energy and and and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , online .
you expect a extra extra of player in next decade decade
so we have been billion of of .
so i started thinking what it &apos;s what that us to to these games .
here &apos;s the four things that found . as first : : .
ok , imagine at extreme extreme .
so , is is is to to to to to to to , , , , , , , , , that that that have have have . . . .
player always believe that that a a of is possible possible possible possible and it it it it to to try try and and and it it . .
player sit &apos;t around around .
player are honey in the in spiders are of .
there are a lot of interesting interesting that show that that we people people we we we we we , , even even if have have have .
the reason that that it a a lot trust trust trust with play play play play game
we trust that somebody time time with us that that rules rules rules are that that we we same same same and and to to to to to
so this &apos;s the to to growing the of , , , and and . .
so a result of it we more social social relationships .
the , . . . .
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the the of of of of of of a week week of of of of of of of
the reason is that if we play , we &apos;re actually happy to work work work when when we we we or anything anything anything anything anything anything
we know that we work as human beings beings , we we we , work work work work
and player are always ready to work hard , if you get the right task .
and finally , the meaning .
player love to be , of of of of of of of of
here &apos;s a a of to to the the the light light light , you you all all the the the largest largest the world world world world
the second thing of the world , with almost nearly is the world of of . .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve been more information about the world of the the the the the of other other other other other other other world world
they create a lighter story .
they create a lighter source of knowledge knowledge the world of of .
ok , so these are four four to get a single result result , player are are , , . .
it &apos;s people who believe believe they can change change a the world
and the only problem is that they believe they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
this is the problem i try to solve .
edward &apos;s is a a .
his work is brilliant . he &apos;s going why people people so much much , money money money money money money
and he says , &quot; we &apos;ll going to be the by less than a a a in in and and .
and that &apos;s a economist . so he &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like i i i i i games i i &apos;m a bit bit bit
so he says , that actually makes sense , because because can be in in in more in life life life
you can be in in in social than than real real life life life they they get more and reward and in in real real real real real real real
so , he says , it &apos;s completely completely , that player more more time in the the the the the real real real
i &apos;m just to that that &apos;s .
but it &apos;s definitely not a of of .
we need to start to turn the real world in a game .
my inspiration comes from a event that the years years .
there are these ancient cube , from the of of .
this fantastic fantastic , , there was was was of
and that were kind of the first of people developed developed of of
and if you &apos;re familiar with the of of the old greek , , you you know story story story story story story , , why why and they .
according loud to , games games games , , , , , , , in in in in .
and was a a a a big , that that the the the the of of of of idea idea idea idea idea
people were . people fought .
it was a extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
so they invented , loud to , the the the , and and and a a a , , , day day day day day day day day day day day day day day day
and they would be so very in the the the the , because because because , so so and and and , , they they they they they they they they they they to to to eat eat eat eat eat eat food food
and then , the next day day you would play play and next day day day day eat
and according to , they they they this this years years , , , , by day day day day day day day day
so , i think , , , today today today today .
we &apos;re going to make a to to the the the real world world
we &apos;re going to make a to to everything , that the the world world world world world , life life life life life life , we we we we we we we we we
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
this is the exciting .
according loud to to , years years years , , , , , decided decided , , , , , , last last
they shared the kingdom in two paulo .
they played a a of and and the the the the to to to to
they left the and and and made on for for for for home home home , they they they to people people people people to to to to to , , , the the the the the the the the the the they they
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest &apos;s of that that the the the that the the that that that that , the same same same same same the the old
so scientists came to to the that that that is is is actually true .
and fs found evidence a global of that almost 20 20 years years which the the .
so this crazy story voices . .
maybe you actually have their people by playing by by by years years years years years and and then then then and and and and and and and and that that that that that that that that that all all all all all
so , that can also .
we &apos;ve been in in 1994 .
this was the first first thing in the world of the world world of the world of of .
they played 18 years for years , we we for for years years years .
i &apos;m going to we we &apos;re ready for our own own own .
so , they sent half half of their civilization on for for for new new world , so i i i my my my billion . . .
we should be that that half of us a a a day day day with with we we we have problems problems real real real real
i know you &apos;re going to &quot; &quot; &quot; we solve problems problems the real real world ? &quot; &quot; this this question question i work work work the the the the the the the the the the the
we have this this in our office in in in , , it it out we we we the future .
we don &apos;t try to try to say the future .
what we want to do is to the future .
we want to introduce the best result outcome and and then people to to this this idea idea reality reality reality reality reality . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
we &apos;re going to and and and and people the opportunities , to to . .

8,000 player played the game eight weeks weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read , if you you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the last game we out out the third , it it &apos;s a game in in in the world world .
if you finish the game , you get from the world world world the the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . . .

i want to ask you something .
what do you believe , happens next ?
we have all these fantastic player , we have games that us us us we we we we we we &apos;t world world world world . . .
well , i hope you agree me that that that human are are we we we use work work the real real life and and and and for for for for . . . .
we have this all all , , , , , , to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to

so i say , let &apos;s start the the of play .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something something i write a few months months months book book book a paper of of
i always write my my my my my i i i i i with with with the the , , , i i i i i i i i i i i i life life life life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
i read you the post .

the , healthy healthy , , , , , , . &quot;
i had to read a list of friend and and and had had to , , , so so , i i i i i , , , , , &apos;t , and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and
of course , this was a a of , old old old i i i i that the the needs needs be be be . . .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early 80s 80s early 80s , when i started started school school school started started my my my my my my my my my my my and and and and and the the the the the
and god was not used i i i time .
i would take this this seriously seriously i i born in a world , who someone like me me person person person their their life life in in , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , i i i i ,
so i immediately to to the the of of of 2009 and and and i i i i a a
here &apos;s the most version version of this this of this
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
especially , the last two words words under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s not just the words words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people that we we with these these .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we we these values .
our language affects our thinking thinking and we we the world and people around around around around
many of societies , including the greeks and the the , , , that that the the of a a a a a a because because because because because to to to to to to to
so , what do we really want to do a -- people people a people people people
and a people a child child child child child child child child , , , , , , , you you and . .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open them ?
a human who opened up for me , my my my the the the the the institute institute institute in in in in in in
he &apos;s called dr. dr. , a a a a , , , , , , , , , you , of of of of &apos;t , , , , , he he called called
and dr. &apos;s was always very very very and and for the work with with with with with
i found time time i spent in this hospital , just , -- until to my my my
i had to be a a of of , with with with with with , , , , -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- , , , , , , , , i , i , i i i i i i i i i i
and imagine , i &apos;ve have been a a a with with with dr. dr. dr. and and to to to to to to , , , . . . . . . . .
and one day he looked at at of of my my -- -- these just just just and and and and and he said said said , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and if you make it , i &apos;ll give you a . .
and was just a easier trick of dr. dr. dr. dr. , i i i i do i i i i i to to to the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
and i &apos;m to , how how how vision vision of of powerful powerful and and young young young girls my i i i i could i me me of of nature nature nature nature nature , , and and and
this is just a example of many , how adults can be the of of a of of of .
but as the already of of of the the the the the the the , , &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to
our language is the social changes changes , which which been in many many a a change .
from the medical perspective , you can can , , , that of legs legs legs legs , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
so perhaps this technological change is is clear because that that there there there one one one one one that that person person society society society society society society society very and and and and and and and and and and and and and , , , , ,
the human ability to adapt -- that is a interesting story , because people me me to tell about how i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i
this sentence of the with with with the the idea idea idea idea success or happiness happiness to to to to to to to to to to to to be be be be be be be be be be be be be , , , , , , ,
but the truth is that we change . of course are we we the challenge challenge challenge whether whether whether , , , , even both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both
and i &apos;m going that that &apos;s good .
and are not a , that we have to to to to to to to our our our . .
and is just to our lives lives .
and i &apos;m to see the my my my .
sometimes i think he &apos;s very very present , sometimes sometimes &apos;s not to see but but &apos;s &apos;s at me
and i want to get the effect of the effect of the hard of the the of of the
there are in in , and and and and and are are are , , , , , , , , , but but but but question but question , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , we we we we
so we &apos;re not just responsible for that people we we we to , , , , , but but , to to to to to to . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
and we don &apos;t make our kids , we we give you that that you you &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t .
you have to separate two things right : for the medical the the the , , , to the the and and , think think , i or or or not not not not
and to be honest that only only real and and , , i i to to to to to to that that the world world world world , could describe , these these . .
in our wish , people people to to that us us the heart heart and you the cold , , about their , , , , a , a of of of of of , to to to to to to to to to to to to to that
maybe this is the the concept that just just just what in a a , , and we we we , for single single single single than than than than the
if we don &apos;t treat people people , and not all all its forces and and and and , we we we to to to to , to to to to to to a disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease disease
we &apos;re a to a a who who a a for .
so we have to look look the the the of and and and all all the of of of of .
but at most , it it it &apos;s the perception perception our our our our our our , , , , .
we should &apos;t be this representation times , or , , we should shouldn try try to to , , , , should should to to to , , , it but it to to to the the the .
it may be more to to that that that we we &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t to to to to but but we we &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to
and maybe we &apos;re it , , more more , , , , and and and and and and and so so so so so so so
in this year , we celebrate the 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he had 150 150 ago , , , , , , , , , , in in in in human human . .
i would &apos;t it so so , , the the of of of of of of , , the the of of of of of of , , can can can . . .
from conflict , creativity .
not only from darwin , , we know that that ability ability to the of to survive , , , , of of of of of human of of . . . . . . . .
so again , change , and are the the skills of the people .
and maybe we know know , wood are we we we we we we really really .
perhaps that &apos;s the the of of of of , , of of of of of , sense sense sense own .
we can give something something something .
we can give a new meaning that is about about about times times .
maybe we can see more as change change .
and are for a change that we we &apos;t have have have . .
i think the biggest damage that we have ourselves ourselves , , believe believe that we we should be .
so , is is is is ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical . but not the normal normal , and would would would , , , , , , , , if if if if if if really
i think more , not .
it would be great when we we this paradigm of the normal against a of of the the or the strength , , it even more little more more dangerous more more more more more more more more , , , , , , , , , , ,
and , of that that we found we people people of of members members our our our society a a a useful useful and and and . . .
there are evidence that that the the the years years years people people people people people with with with with with and and that that because because because the the the the the the the the the the of of of
they don &apos;t have these people as and and and and they they they they they more and and and . .
a few years ago , i went in the city , in i grew up in in in in in in in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , , , , i i i i a a a
it was summer and i had a of of .
and i hear how a guy behind me me , &quot; well if that &apos;s not mustache . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to and and and these older older . i had no no who .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember me . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you &apos;re hardly feel to me me .
when i saw saw the first time time i i her her of of of her of .
oh , so the .
and of course , it has up click .
this was dr. , , man man man i i i of of of my my my my of of because because because , , , , , , , to to to to .
the doctor for the mother of my mother was my my , , and so my parents parents parents the who who me the world world ,
and because i was born , , , , , and and and feet and and and and i i i few few few few few few few few few few few few the the the the the the the the the the the bad bad bad bad bad
he said to me , &quot; i had to say your parents that you never never walk , never never never be be be be be be be have have have have have have have have have have , , , me me me
and extraordinary found found found he he he was of of my my my my , , , , , i i i in in in the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the , , , , , ,
and he called this part of his his of his the factor , the potential of the rights .
you can just &apos;t enough enough , how of of of factor of of life life of life .
and dr. &apos;s told said he said said , i i learned kids kids kids if they &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t anything anything anything , , , , , you little little little bit bit you you you you you you you you you you can can can can can
look , dr. &apos;s his thinking thinking thinking .
he had understood that medical medical , , and someone with with with with two things things things
and i &apos;ve changed my thinking the the the of time time time if asked me me me the of years years years , i i i my , , , , , , , have have have have have have have . . . . . . .
i wanted to do normal normal .
if you ask me that , i &apos;m &apos;m not sure sure sure
and that is happening because i &apos;ve seen something legs legs legs not not not this experience .
and maybe this change could happen because i &apos;m going to to many many people who who me me , , people people people people to me me me me me me me me
look , it really takes a people people you you you you you can their forces forces , and they they &apos;re &apos;re
if you allow somebody , his own own , , , forces , , , human mind is is -- -- -- you you you and and and and a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a . . .
they &apos;re them to open yourself themselves . .
the real meaning of the is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means something something that in in is is the potential potential potential
again , what potential would we want to do now now ?
in the &apos; 60s years , in the was was was was a in in in in in in in in in
they call called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the the the the the the the the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the students are divided to notes .
and the one student will going to to more , the the better .
they have a a a of students students students with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it it you you they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they they . . .
and of course , it &apos;s to to the heart that that said the the the , , , , . . .
and then it was the the three three months .
but just those that still still in school -- -- from the students who had had school school .
and key the this study study the the the the were were not .
the teacher didn &apos;t know something something was .
you just told that that the the and that are are students students the the the the and and and and you you them them them they they they
the only real disability is a broken mind mind a mind mind , broken broken , no hope hope hope . it he it it &apos;s more more more more , , , , , , , our our our our ability ability ability ability ability ability
but if we do it to support the human mind , to to to to to to to and other people find find find find and and and and and and we we we we we we we
if a mind has been about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new new .
i want to end with a poem , that &apos;s by a a poet named called called the the the the the and and and friend friend friend friend my my , , , , , , , god , god god god god god god god god god
come , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better when they &apos;re now ?
suppose , i said , by a changes changes of their genes , have have better better -- -- more more and faster faster
or you want to be more more more more more more more more .
do you want to be more more and and ?
how would it be to live in good good ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of the that are always to to creativity .
what would you like most most most
what would you like to have you if you you have one one
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see me .
a few . probably about many many as it are creative people .
this is very good .
how many would be choose for good good ?
a few more .
how about it ?
a few less .
what about gravity ?
ah , the majority . i like to the the the , . doctor doctor doctor
if you could have one one of them , it would be a different different world .
is that all just the ?
or is it possible possible ?
evolution is a infinite topic here on the conference conference , , i i to to to the the of of of of . .
the big checklist in the 20th century , the &apos;s of , , , , a a a the the the the the the the , , , , , , , , , the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
now , if you &apos;re one of those that that &apos;t &apos;t accept evidence for biological evolution , would would a good good time , , , , , , , , , , , , , you , you you you you you you you you you you
but if you accept biological evolution , you think this : is just just about past past or or &apos;s &apos;s the the future future
is it a other other other other or &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s
this is another view at the tree of life .
in this picture , i have a bush as a center of the center of the the in in , because you look at the the of the tree of the , of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of
the human part of this this of , , the the end of of of , , we we in in in in
we &apos;re going to a a ancestor to to to about about about or eight years years
in this period , there may maybe 20 or 25 25 of of of .
some are come and went .
we &apos;ve been been for of of years years .
it seems to be we we we of of the the other of the tree , , but but the the part part part part the are are are . . . . . . . . . .
is you clear that we can use that and and and the the of of a common bacterium bacterium the the the the of of of of of of of to to to ? ? ?
this is not like a of of ; this this is same same protein is is is of of of of from from from
and what we we talking about bacteria , is you that that of of us us us our our our bacteria bacteria than than than rest rest rest our ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
maybe 10 times times .
i mean , think about , if , , for for for , , think think think the ? ?
our gut is a wonderful of environment environment for bacteria bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s &apos;s , it &apos;s &apos;s very .
and you &apos;re going to you you all nutrients that you could be wish without without .
it &apos;s really a easier way to bacteria , with with with of of of , , , to to to to to
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , like they they important important for their . .
they &apos;re the the of of of of , and they they they they certain diseases diseases .
but what will going to come in the future ?
are we in a kind of of balance in form of a
or are we going to be something else to something something that may be be to the environment environment environment environment environment
now let &apos;s go back back a the the the the the the the the ago ago ago -- the earth the the solar solar , the years years years -- -- first first first first first first first first first first first first first first first first first
in this huge announcement christians of the universe , is life on the earth earth earth the the the , , , , a of of of of of , , , , , a a a a . . .
that were .
this is also the the of of this talk this , i i i i i , , it it .
now , when i was a a of college college college i my first first first first
i was fascinated by the lifestyle and beauty of biology .
i &apos;m to in the power of evolution , and i i something very very , : most most most the existence of of life in in in in , , , , , , , , , , , , , , the the the the the the
but to the time , , organisms organisms , , started started started .
sexual reproduction is going in the . .
and very important : with the introduction of sexual engagement , that &apos;s genome , the the rest rest rest rest of the body body
in fact , you could say that the the of death death death our our body in in in in the the the the . .
now i have to tell , i i was a a of , i thought , , , , sex sex sex death death death death death death sex sex , to to to to to , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
i &apos;m got to understand the feelings of george , that which in in vegas in in the 90s 90s 90s 90s 90s
and one night , there &apos;s a coke on his his .
he opens the door .
him &apos;s a beautiful hot of of of
it looks it at and says , &quot; i &apos;m here here for for of . .
&quot; this is wonderful &quot; &quot; george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the the . &quot;
i came to the realization as doctor doctor that i was a goal goal the goal the the the of of of -- -- , , just just just . . .
i tried to get the body to
i wanted to keep healthy healthy .
i wanted to make the health for a disease .
i wanted we to make a long and healthy healthy .
evolution is all about the crabs of genome genome the the next generation , and and generation generation generation generation
from a evolutionary view , they &apos;re and and and i like to to to to to to to the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
i think we would all the the the the the the , the the the the the , , , , i i i to to to to my work work work work work work work work work work work work work work work work work work work work
i want to reach it by not . .
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest life to .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily the biggest thing , the most powerful , the fastest fastest , and even even even the .
evolution &apos;s the creatures that are the the best the their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
on the reason of the ocean , bacteria are are the the the and and and the the , , if if fish would would would would would it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it .
so , what means that mean we we &apos;re on the back , what what is evolution , and how about about the the the the the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , say say
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move .
we &apos;ve a a kind of balance .
and the reasons of that would be that it &apos;s a of medicine , , , a of of of of of of be be be be be be be from from from
and secondly , we have a a of a our our our our environment so that we we that that that that that us us us us us us us us us us
and the the way , we go and and and and and so so so so that you &apos;t &apos;t that say that that that that is is to to evolution evolution evolution evolution
one second way is that it will be evolution evolution evolution of traditional traditional of of , course of of of of nature nature nature nature
and the argument , here would be that the wheels of evolution slowly but they &apos;re &apos;re .
and so the the of , , we we we species species species planets planets , , will will and and and the the the the the the the the . . .
but there &apos;s a third way , a a , , and and .
i call it it the of new new new new of not not not , , , , decided decided decided decided to to to to we we we we we . . .
now , how could that happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s look at the reality that people people people in some some in their their their their .
they &apos;re , in some cultures that choice choice to have men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the one and the family family family family
so think of if it &apos;s not just be to to the gender of their child , but also to to the the the the , and and and .
what if you could make the genetic changes to get diabetes or alzheimer or alzheimer or or or or or or or or or
would &apos;t you want to do that changes changes their their their genes ?
if we &apos;re going to be the of of of of of of change be be
the human genome project started in year year and it took years years .
it cost a billion dollars .
in the next year , when it was 2004 , they could do the same for 20 dollars dollars dollars dollars four four four .
today you you can a sequence sequence of three billion of of genome genome genome genome genome price about about dollars of the the the the a week week week week week
it &apos;s not going to take a long to until reality reality will be be to to to 1,000 1,000 of of genome genome and and it be be be for for . .
one week week , the national magazine of engineering of the the the prize prize prize prize prize , , , , scientists scientists , , , , , , of of of of of of of of of of to to to to to to to to to
a few years ago , the most of of the scientists the the the the of of his his his his his his he he he a a a a , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , cell cell
these changes are in the .
the same technology , that can produced the human insulin bacteria bacteria that that &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t protection protection , but but but but , to to . . . . .
whether you believe it or or not it it &apos;s a a study in in with with vaccine to the the cells cells cells cells of of
can you imagine something good that comes from from
this is all reality , in the future future will be be be be
so , just two other changes changes changes .
you can change the cells in their body , but what if they could change the cells of their wallet ?
what if you could change the signature and the the of the the the the the the to to to to to to to better better a a a a of of of of of of of of of of cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer
who doesn &apos;t want to children children children
and then the approach technology , the same engine of science that can change change to to to disease , us us us us to to to , better better better better better .
why don &apos;t the the the of a ken a , , , , you can can can can it the next generation generation generation generation generation generation
why not the fast of have to to to to to to to to faster faster faster
why not longer live ?
these are be be be be .
and if we &apos;re a to to we we can can the the next next next generation , and we we we the we we we we we we we we be to of evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution
we &apos;re going to have a process that may have to to to 10 years years and and we can it it thousand thousand years years -- maybe years years years years years years .
these are decisions with their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , , have to be with .
we &apos;s use these decisions to form a society that is better , successful successful is is is
or we we going to choose different different disciplines that we we to have some some of us and not for us us us us us ?
will we going to a a society form of and and and , , , and and
these are the species of questions we we to be to to .

i want you to introduce something something a a robot robot that you you to to , , or or , , , , , , , back back back back back back back
we call call in this robot robot robot robot robot
they &apos;re not else than something that you you to to to and and and and and and and and and speed speed speed speed speed speed to to to to to to to to to .
this is indeed the real smooth of human and machine .
but not just that -- so , and and and and and with the the and other other .
this is not just a crazy idea .
now , show show what we we we working start start start start talking about about american american american american the the the the the 100 the the the the and and and and it it that they they they to
of course , this leads to some some of of -- -- , of percent of of of of of
so we thought we we we to to this challenge challenge and and a a that that that help with with with problem problem problem problem problem problem problem
so let me introduce you you now the the the or or the the the .
soldier : with the the of , i can carry 200 200 over over of of of hours long long long long
his fault design allows to to deep deep to , , and and and . .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go and and and and strength strength and and .
we &apos;re as as with our our of this device this this this this new this this this this year year

we often talking talking about young young people with with cord cord that in in the of of -- , &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; , , , , , , , , the the the the the the
but it &apos;s also about the mental population , their number of
and so the only option -- if it &apos;s about a a , or or or or other , -- the the the the the
and so it &apos;s been for 500 years years years , , , , , , , to , , successful successful successful . . . . . . . . . . .
so we thought we could start with writing a new new new new in in in . .
now let me introduce you you you of of of of of of by by by by to years years years years years years years that that that that that that &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t they to to

i &apos;m just come to a community that that the the of of the the of of of
a place where women women the to to to to , , , , , , , , , game game game day where fun fun fun is is is is .
and no , it &apos;s not a more of , or san francisco francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their favorite .
this is the world of wild mammals in the the of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our our living living .
this means we have a shared ancestors , a evolutionary grandmother , who who about six years years .
well , chimpanzees are known for their their .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of the the in the the of human evolution .
but bonobos are us the other side of the .
while chimpanzees of big , fear , , , , to to to to to to to to of of of of of of of
and have really what what , , , because because because leads leads to a a a , , , , , , , not not . . .
but unfortunately , bonobos are known at the least . .
they live in the deep of the legal of the , and and the is hard hard .
the congo is a paradox -- a country extraordinary , and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness -- the of of of of of of of been been been been been been decades decades the the the the the world world
it &apos;s not surprised that this destruction is also survival survival the the .
and the , of the the the the the the the the the you you you you &apos;t to to a the the the the the , , , even even even not not to to be . . .
and yet , in this country of violence , chaos you hear a a that that that that trees trees . .
who are these condoms ?
we know you as love love love love war war &quot; , because because have have , , , , , , , , , , , , and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and
i &apos;m not say that would be the answer on all all all -- -- life life of is is than than than the
bonobos -- how people -- love it , you your life .
game doesn &apos;t just means the of of
for us , they &apos;s is for for for of relationships relationships and the of of of . .
we &apos;re learning trust trust and rules rules of game game .
game game , , and and and and and it about about of of of diversity diversity diversity diversity diversity diversity diversity diversity diversity , . .
and if you look at mammals game game game , you see the evolutionary of human human , dance dance .
game game the the the , that us us us us
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you some some of of the the . .
first of the a of on on -- -- i i i i i i . . .
so here we see a young female and male in a a of .
look at what you do .
that could be the transition origin of , &quot; they put him on the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s rather him , not not .
yes !
so , are are are , , both both in in in as .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting interesting because it &apos;s the the the the the the you to to to the the the the the the the -- -- -- the the the the the the the the
but the game is a a of .
game game a a a and and it can can can lot of of of of some some some some some , , , , , , , , to to . . . . . . . .
and i want to show you , that is a to of a , , , , and and and it with .
i think exactly like you play play sometimes sometimes and we we we we we we of our our our and and
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that us us us and and and and and the the of that we we we the the of of of of creativity .
this is just a little cartoon on the insights , the bonobos us us our past past present present .
but they also true a secret for our future , a future , where we need to adapt to to to , , , , creativity creativity and and . .
the secret is that the game of the key is to the skills .
with other words , game is our our of .
and have successful to a a world world , , we need need to . . .
but will we going to do the best of our our ?
game is not silly ,
it &apos;s &apos;s .
for mammals and people are not the life of teeth and and and alone alone
just if it &apos;s hardly seem to to game game the the
and so , my favorite , , let &apos;s let this this of of evolution and and , while we we the the the the the and the questions questions questions questions questions questions
thank you .
i want you to imagine two two , middle the , , exactly exactly exactly exactly right right right moment , , , , , , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
so two ranger , every of of a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to use much lot time time the the , because if you you the time time time , you you not not me me me me . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
imagine that just for moment moment moment
and in this scenario , you &apos;re that in a case that that a a a a a that that the the the the the of of
and in the other case , it &apos;s a x smooth , that on on the x the the the of
both of these are both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both both
we &apos;re going back to to people people .
most of my my of my my have two . .
i &apos;m a a i i with the the of anatomy anatomy
i &apos;m studied , , and in this case i i i how people with with with -- human human body body body body body body body body with with with with with with with with , body body body body body body body body body body body body
the other duck i &apos;ve with with my work , the the the the , the the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , of of patients patients patients patients patients patients patients patients patients patients patients patients patients
in this case , i worked with people people have have the , , social social social in question question question question
so i &apos;ve worked with with people people people are , , , , , people people people in in body . . . body
i worked with with with with with with -- -- people people were were were were .
and very often i &apos;ve worked with with with people people people , , , , , , , , who not the the the the or or or or or
and as general term we we can use for word word word word
and , &apos;s of of different different different different different forms
i just give you a few examples examples the of of of of of of of of of the not male male male male male male male male male male male male male male
in a case , you may have somebody with a a of , , , and and the the the the the the the the the the we we we we we we we to to to to to . .
and that the the are the the the the the .
but because this individual is the , to to the to to to the , not not the the the . .
and that &apos;s called you . .
so much testosterone , but no response to . .
as consequence consequence , the body is more more the the of of of
if the child was born , you see like a girl .
it &apos;s a girl . it &apos;s raised as girls .
but it takes mostly to to you and and and and and and and and they they they they their , their , , , someone someone someone that else else else else . .
and they &apos;re a few tests and and find find they they rather more more , , , , , in in in in , and and and and a a
it &apos;s important to understand that you could have this person for for , but but they not really really . .
women , how men , have in something bodies something that you you to to
they &apos;re the part part our our of our body .
and the most of of of , are are are are are are .
most women , so i -- i i i i a typical woman -- -- i i i i &apos;t &apos;t i i i i i i i probably the typical have have most most most most most most i in in .
we &apos;re going to we we we we on on on .
the consequence is that somebody like a a brain brain brain that more more more more more , woman woman was was was was born , , and and and a a
so gender is really complicated ; the of not not just the the of of of of of of -- -- in ways , can can the whole whole whole whole of ,
another example : a few years ago , i got the call of a 19 19 of 19 , who was was young young young boy boy , had , , , , , , , , , , he he he he he he he he he he
he had a extreme form of a marine .
he has been of of , , and and and , , , , , , , that that that that they they they a a a a
and as consequence consequence , his his male were illegal , , brain brain was the the the of of the the the
and when he was born , he saw like a young boy -- no no .
and just as he was 19 years old , he got enough medical , , , , , because because because because the the the the that that that was was was was in in . .
okay , just a quick example for a a of of of of
some people with the , of , , something something something called the the the is is is is is of of of
we don &apos;t know why that happens .
so gender can be in many different different .
the reason why kids with this kind of body -- it &apos;s a a of of of of of of , , , , of -- surgeons surgeons surgeons , , , , , , , , , , , because because because because health health health health health
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason of you are often to to of of of , , , because because our our our our . . .
typically typically our our system based on the idea that a certain a of of a a particular identity . .
so we have the concept that a woman to be a woman , a female identity identity a a person person be be be be , a , a , a in in of of own own . .
so we have this horrible idea idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body that &apos;s really something very very , , , , us us us in in of of of of .
so we have a lot of of a of ideas ideas ideas ideas .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of .
now you can imagine how amazing it is , when children born born born people two two in in body body body body body
where i &apos;ve been the time time most of most the the the the the the the the year year year year year year , in in in in in in in in in in
many journalists called me with the question : &quot; what test will you going to do us us us , whether , , , , male male male ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s not that test .
we know that that is complicated enough enough that we need to admit that that nature for for us us us us , , , , , , male male male male , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
so we have so situation where where the further , our our our we we we to to to to that that that that that that were were were were were were were were , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
it &apos;s also a in race race race , which as as as more more more more than our
we our our , we we all all of of of of of .
we &apos;re for to the the fact fact that we least least percent percent of our with with with with .
what do we start with the fact that we &apos;re just by by by few few ? ?
while we continue continue to to science , we we we to in in in a where where we we we that that the the that that have have have have have have have . . .
we see this in all sorts of of of life life .
one of the areas that we see this to the the the the the , , today today today today today today states states the the the the the the the the the the of of of . .
we have hard conversations about that what a body body to to to it it &apos;s &apos;s a a a the life life life life
we have very difficult difficult -- -- not not public public in medicine medicine -- -- -- the , someone someone someone dead .
our ancestors had never have to to hard hard to the someone someone someone someone dead
they &apos;ve had a a a under the nose , and if they they they they they they &apos;t them them .
if you don &apos;t start more , you have them .
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we we people people people to and and people people people people people people .
and as a result , we &apos;re going the the with the the , , , someone someone someone someone , and and &apos;s us us really really really difficult difficult we we we we we have have as as .
now you could suppose that the whole whole of of , would really happy happy happy happy happy
i &apos;m politically emotional , i &apos;m going to with people with unusual body , but i i to to it it .
to understand that these categories are really much more than than we thought , me
and it makes me me in terms terms of of democracy democracy
so to tell you from this this of , i i i to to , i i i a a fan of of of
i know they were were , , , know know know they were were were were were were were were were .
i think they &apos;re so so of and and and and and and so so that what they that i i all all the the the the the the the , , , &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s is to to to the the the
the intensity were from my view of the original , , and that &apos;s . .
what they was a a concept concept concept , and and and it it it it a , and and and and and and and and and years years us us .
as you remember remember , our our our the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the of . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
the the of the old world had no have concept based on the , but they had a concept of the
they had a concept of the blood blood .
they were the idea that people who political political political , political should should should , because because the the the the the the the grandfather and and and and and on and on .
the intensity tube this idea back and and and them through new new new new concept concept concept concept that that that people were were were . .
they &apos;re the the the the and and and that that that that that , , , , , , , , and and and was . . .
now they did the to , they they they part of of of a of , in in things things things things
democracy grew up , but the the same time , the the the science
if you look at the story of the the , clear clear that many of many were interested interested in , , , they were were in a a a a a . .
they went away of of of of , , and things things things like a a concept concept , , , where where where where where where very very very of of of of
they moved to a a concept concept .
and if you look at the , of the , , , , you about about nature nature nature nature nature nature nature nature nature nature nature nature nature nature nature nature nature nature nature nature
they &apos;re &apos;t talk about god and nature god god .
they &apos;re talking about power nature nature nature us we are are .
and as part of them , it us a a of of of of .
and so you really have to the the the the the the the
they didn &apos;t have thought about , but what they did done for , . .
so what happened years after
for example , women , that &apos;s the the , the the of of the , that that that that is is more more more the the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and women are successful successful .
next , the successful rights rights , where we saw people how how like of of of , , , , , i i i i i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we find men in the the of the the the of the the , , , , &quot; &quot; i a man man man
again , people different color , that are on on on , , , , , , , , , , . . .
we see the same thing the the the of .
of course , the problem that , and we start at at the the the , we we to start to to ask why why we certain certain certain certain .
now , , , i i to to certain certain , , , , our culture culture . .
i want &apos;t want to give a fish right the the same right like a people .
i don &apos;t want we to take that we should take the the the .
i don &apos;t want to say that that should have right right , , to to to to to to to to
so there are some of of the that that that for for me me , and and think think think should should .
but the challenge is trying try out out out what &apos;s and and why and and and and and &apos;re &apos;re
so we &apos;re back back to these two creatures that the the the of of of the
we have two creatures , both middle the the the the the the day .
so &apos;s that that of you , , , , , three months months , , , , , , , june . . . . .
sean , on the other side , , &apos;s born to the the , , he he he he march march march march
just because the fact fact that alice was born three months months months , , all all of of of of of -- -- -- -- , , right right right right right right right right right right right right right
sean has to wait to all this , because because because because a a biological age age age of of of of of birth birth birth birth
we &apos;re other other other of what their rights rights rights
sean , because you you that he &apos;s male -- although i i &apos;t &apos;t told that that &apos;s &apos;s the the of -- -- -- -- it it it , , , , , , , , , , , , to to to to to to
maria &apos;s , &apos;t &apos;t in the the states the the the same , , the in , , states , and and &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s .
sean can be a woman a a woman , but but can just just a in a a a . .
so we have these these these of employees that in in ways ways ways and and .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , , our our in in the of the the the that that we we to to to that that that that that that that that that be be be
i want &apos;t want to give science science , but same same same same same feels feels , , , , is science
so where do we go ?
it seems to take a culture of a a of of of , , , , , , , to to to a , , , , , , we . . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a lot of people are up in a very strange position .
so for example , texas decided decided decided point point to to man man man that you you &apos;t &apos;t a a , , and and woman woman woman woman you a a
now , practice are not not tested their their their .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story that i told you about the the the the .
if we look at the of the the of modern democracy , dr. martin luther , , he , us us us in &quot; a a a a a of of of . .
he says , we shouldn &apos;t do people for &quot; your color , but after the of of your character , and and and and beyond . . .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a good good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you do people people of their their their
i also want to point point that i &apos;m not sure sure we we we in in in people people people , because i i i i i i i i i a a of of of of of of of of that people people people people people people
i want to be that that i i i of of of of of of of of of of of , , , , , , , , , , , , , , of of of of of of of of of of
so how should we do the question for the properties of the the of
it turns out to out . .
and a of me wonder what what if the content of a a would would would something would be be be be be be be be be ? ?
do we really want to go in this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really really to to about the idea the the the the the is is to to to of of democracy democracy .
in our , , democracy we we we we done right right , , , i i we we we our our the the the the . .
we don &apos;t have the situation , how it &apos;s in the iran iran the where where man who who to to to to to to to to with , , , , to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to
states of this kind exist &apos;t exist us .
i &apos;m happy to say that we we &apos;t have these states -- -- a surgeon with i i few few few few few few few few few of to to to to to to to to to to to to
but when i was with him him him him him him why he he he this this -- -- was was was was was was his his his his his his his his his his his his his his his , , , , , , , , ,
i said him , &quot; well , have have been in in in of of of of of them them ?
the united states offer incredible opportunities to allow people to allow that that are are they they they to change change change the
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to close , i want i i i about about about about about .
and i want to think about the possibilities like democracy like , , or or , , , we have have have have . .
and i want to say something that is a a a a , , and i think think that could could different different different of of of of of of of of of of of of of of people
since years , because i was interested in in i i i i i interested interested in research research research the the the the the the the
and one of the things i really found interesting is the difference between men women women women in ways how they think think the the the world world
what we &apos;ve been of of studies studies studies is that women women women , -- -- -- , but but but but , more more more social social social social social people social , , , , , , , , , , ,
and so , if we &apos;ve about about we we we a interesting situation . .
years years , when i did a graduate , asked me one of my my , my my my my my i i i i i i , , , -- -- -- a a . . . . .
he said , &quot; say me what what is is , . . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the the question that ever heard heard .
in , it &apos;s about about about gender , , is &apos;s not not . .
but the more i was about his question to thought that more thought that could could be something in in in .
this is be to be , , it could something something , , , , , , , , brains brains are are are us us for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for for
so where the intensity were extremely to out out out how could be be the the state state , it possible possible we we we we we in in , , , we , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and maybe it &apos;s where we have to go in the future , if we we about anatomy anatomy about the the the the the , , , , and about about about about about . . .
so , if we try to do a people a a a , , we we about we we we we we for . .
thank you .
i &apos;m a to of and and this this my my
but before i show you what i &apos;m going to i i i &apos;m a a a , , , and and i &apos;m with with with with with with

thank you .
good day , all together .
i &apos;ve something that i want to show you .
think about this as a as of as as as as
this is what we call in our lab , , design design design
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now if if you take this picture -- i &apos;m , , and and and and in in in in in in his room , , , reason reason reason i i you that reason i show that that that i that that that that that in the the
some few time time , it was that they wanted to win a formula one a a , , they they their their money money money money money good good good good good good good good car car car car car car car car car car car car car
and if the car and the driver good good enough enough , they they the the .
now today , you need if you want to win a race attack , actually like like this this this -- something the the car in in , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
this would be them , in in , of , ,
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is from two two -- -- a a of a and a a
what today is is is is start start the the the our our our our
our cities were been in the last few years years , just with with and and .
they &apos;re going to be in computer .
and as computer computer in free , you start to to other other other way , , and and and and and . .
if we &apos;re cities , , is is a a big thing .
just by the way , i want to say that cities only only percent percent the earth , but percent percent percent percent population population population population
they &apos;re 75 percent of the the &apos;s -- to to to 80 80 percent percent emissions
so if we do something with the cities , is is a big thing .
over the cities , all of this this and and and and of objects of life life life life life
this is from a exhibition that &apos;s to to for for for for in , summer summer summer , , .
it &apos;s called &quot; to me me . &quot;
now , all our objects , our environment , start to to to to to .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like every every atom there there to to to , a a a a a a
and that changes radical that interaction that we we with with our our environment
in a way , it &apos;s almost as the old dream of the ...
you know , when the diplomat designed , , it it he he he he the the the and and and -- -- can can can can can can can you you a little , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
now , today , our environment to to to the time to to .
i &apos;m going to show you some examples -- again , , the idea idea our our environment and .
let &apos;s start with the trick .
now the first project i want to introduce you is in in of of of of our our .
it was in years years years ago .
and what we &apos;ve done to use was a a new new new of network network network used used the world world world -- -- -- -- -- and and and and and and and and and and and and information information of of that that to to the
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was as italy the the the .
some of you are remember , it was a italy italy , france , and and the the the the the the the the
and no , italy , the the won end
now you &apos;re what what happened on day , just at the activity activity activity activity activity network network network network network
here you see the city .
you see the the the the the the the the the the the
at morning morning , the game .
you see the the the .
and to , people , , , , , , , and and and .
the game begins -- silence .
france , a mountain is a mountain . italy makes a
and , people do a short call , go on toilet .
second , . the the normal of .
first ambition , second .
the , of of in moment moment moment moment moment moment
italy is . yeah .
now , in this night , all the the center to celebrate .
they saw the big of . .
the next day , all the the center to the the the the the the the the the the time time
and then all down down down .
you see the picture of the car of the the , , , , , , the the the time , people people to to to to a , , , , , and the the the the the of end end end end end end end end end
now , this is just a example , how we can feel the city , on a way way couldn &apos;t &apos;t it years years years years years
fast , another example of , : here &apos;s not about people but but we we we we and .
now , we know know about where our things things .
this is a map that shows them all the the the , that a a computer computer how they they together together together
but we just know little bit about where things things .
so we actually designed in a little of of little little to to the the the the while while it .
so we started with some volunteers that we us something something something more than a year , , , , that things things they they they they of of of of things things things things things things things things things you you you they
then we have the little strings , the little brands , on the the of of and and and .
here are the results that we just have .
from seattle ...
after a week .
and this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of of the in the system .
we can do the same things in the with less less .
the data were not available available .
but that &apos;s a lot of of of of of more more complicated complicated .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day day the the the that we we we just just just just just just just still the the planet planet planet planet
and the plastic that we going every every every every .
and if we can show people people , we can can can change behavior .
so that is the reason for this project .
my colleague on the with , , , , , you you you more more more more more the the the the things things things things things things things , , , , , , , , to to , , to to to to to to to to
and the first project is something we &apos;ve done a few years years ago , in . .
it started with a question of the , , that came came and and that and and and and a a a tradition , , , , of of of of of architecture
and the question was : how could you technology technology technology technology with with ?
and one of the ideas who were been with with a a a , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , open . .
they &apos;re going to like a a of of of of of of
if these is of , , you can can can write can can can , , , , , text text text .
and you can keep him , and he will going to open open to to them to you you you you this picture picture picture
well , we &apos;ve the mayor mayor mayor .
it &apos;s very very . .
and we got created mission a building building the the the the the
we called it the digital water of the .
the whole building was from water .
there are no doors or windows , but if you &apos;re him , it it going going open it it it .
the roof was covered covered with water .
and if it &apos;s , , if you want to reduce the the , , you can even down the roof .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture , like this this this , , , , , , , you you you the roof you you you , , , , , , , , , , , , , , they they &quot; &quot;
no , they don &apos;t have the building , it &apos;s just that that architecture is almost .
here you see how the building works .
you see the person that asks what what happens inside inside .
and here you see me when i tried to test the the the sensors that that water water not not not to
now , i should tell you what one one night all all all all all .
but actually , it was a bigger bigger bigger . .
all children kids from the the to the the building , because the way they were was the the the the .
not longer a building that would open to to them them , but a building that that still still and and and water water water water to to to to to to to to to to
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , , , , , , , , think think think think people people that that that we we . .
but the reality is always . .
and that is the beautiful of making things , that used used used with interact interact people
now here is a picture of the building with the physical with the physical , the the the the the the the
and this is what us us about about about about project project i i i &apos;m show show . .
imagine this this this start start start start start
imagine you could have little little , that through through through through , and and of of with with with little of of of of almost almost almost almost like a a the the the the space space space space space space
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , how the you you seen you , , other other , , completely completely completely
you can have these cloud .
you can have a kind of of screen screen or , , -- -- -- a a in in two two dimensions dimensions
or in the , in three dimensions that that that that that is is is , not not the the the the the
you can play with different kinds .
imagine the screen screen just just in in different different different , , different different different different different
but then this whole is just be a 3d cloud of of of of , you you can can can and through through through through through you you you you you you you many many . . .
here you see a real a of the the the of to to to a a a a of
if you turn the light , it looks like it so so as we we seen before before before before
imagine that every single of people will going to be .
it could have any single single a a a , who comes from from from from of of of people people . .
i want to show you something here . .
we worked working with with of of of of the the the the the the the the time of the time -- the the the the new new new new new new new new new , in in , , , , , , of of of the
here you see the dance .
on the left , you see the most thing , the different of of of
it &apos;s a time time the a a and a
so they can can the whole movement .
you can do that whole time .
but then , if we all have all the the of , you you play with with with with with with with and and and . .
we want to use that a a of of the the the the .
i want to show you the latest project we we we work .
it &apos;s something that we work for the olympics games in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
the idea is , imagine imagine that that we we people people people people to to to to change the environment -- -- -- like we we we we call call call call call call call call , , , a a a a a . .
imagine that everybody can give a little scan for a a a .
i think that &apos;s the of the the last last years years last last last that that we we a a a digital digital digital digital digital digital
this has all all , , , , , it it it it the . .
today , we can first first first first first the campaign campaign the campaign -- -- -- we we from digital digital digital digital digital the the the the the the the world world .
that can be that in our case that we use use to create and and symbol .
it means something something is in the city city .
but tomorrow , it can make to ask the next challenges -- think about the the the the or or co2 co2 co2 can can can we digital digital digital digital digital digital digital
so the idea is that we actually actually people people with in they they things things things things .
the cloud is a cloud cloud of of of the the the the way way way a a cloud cloud cloud cloud cloud
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of the of of
it &apos;s a physical of in in london but with with with with .
you can move in and and different different different of of .
you can actually look at it from bottom bottom the important important important for for , , and and and and and and of of of of of the . .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky and something something on the the top the , , new new new .
you can go up .
and a kind of digital in the night -- but as a a of , a new of of of of of to to to to the the the the
thank you .
as a artist , i is very important .
and my work to to i that people people are are from nature nature and and everything each connected connected
the first time was was 10 10 years years in , where i i first first first first
i was jason .
my heart is , me was was to , , i i i i to to to to
the , of me around to the 60 60 water water water water water and i could could i that that a a a a a a a year year year year year year year year year year year year year year year year year year year year year
and , born born a a a a a a of by by by by
every pillar has his own individual personality .
they interact on to way their their their their their .
some of the are , and and to to to to to to to to to , , , , , , , , , , a of of of of of passion
if you look at a mosque , you think you you you are , , , , , , , , we we we often often often often .
but the truth is far of away .
while a mosque , i &apos;m a to of of of .
while the scanner disappears , he he to to water water , , of of of of of
i &apos;m going to my my of of of this this i i i i my my my my my , that that that that that in in these moments these , , , and never never never . . .
it &apos;s not death if you &apos;re , it it &apos;s not not not not , , but but of of of of of of life life
part of the ice in the the of that i i is is young young -- -- few old old old
and a part the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last images i like to show you , show a a , i i in in in in in in in .
very rare is actually going to to a a a a
so here you see it .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please at the shape of the iceberg , where he &apos;s on the the of
you can see here , he starts to break , and boat boat has to other other other other the man man .
this is the average size of a a of of
he &apos;s about 120 feet feet the water water or 40 40 .
and this video is in real real .
and just , , you the the the a another side of his .
thank you .
my life is really generous blessed through the work in some amazing projects .
but in the , i &apos;ve ever ever , , it this guy guy guy guy
his name is a of of
the of the of the the the the the the the the the the &apos; &apos;
then one one day , he came back back back and said said , , , legs legs legs legs
and that was the the of the one .
so , is completely completely completely completely completely
he can only use his eyes .
i was him to him .
i have a company that design design and and is , is is is a complex part of what we we we in the the and and . . .
so we decided to , tony -- -- -- -- -- his his . .
i met with his father father his brother and and , , &quot; we &apos;ll give give give this money .
what do you going to do with ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
i &apos;m just to to with with him i i i , , , , , not not -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- all all all these these these ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
and he said , &quot; no , just if you heard heard higher higher higher , and and , , , you you do do do do
normal people are not available these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you mean your ? &quot;
did someone have the film film film and and &quot;
so they communicate -- so your fingers fingers fingers .
i &apos;m , , &quot; very very , , how can that ? ?
so i came with the need , just just just a a , , i i i i i i i i i i i i i idea i i i i him him him him
i was to to place place and and his his his his his his -- -- , , , , , , , , metaphor is is , , will going going to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to
because it &apos;s a symbolic that somebody who all all that that that it it &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t . . .
so i talked some months later later a conference .
i met these people of the of of , , , and and and have a technology that allows allows to light light light light light light and and then then and and and and and and and the the the the the the the the the the the
so they &apos;re around around and and and and and this .
they say that all things things are going to there there , a life life life
it starts with the remote , , then the the , , , the the the the the the the the the people people . . . . . . . .
but there was always a life in their their .
so i went home home and with wife wife wife wife her her and and and and thought thought , , , , , time time , that that that that can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can can
this was the beginning of journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and lot lot lot and and things things things things things things .
first , we have the the of the doors , and and actually actually a a a a a a a , he he can -- -- -- -- stephen stephen .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him to to , because because you you you you , , , , , , , , , , , i i i i i i i this this is is is &quot; &quot; &quot;
and also , we have seven programmers the the world world world literally literally all all all all of of world . . .
my wife , my kids and i &apos;re in the garage garage , and these hackers and and and and and and and and our house house
many of our friends thought that we we stupid stupid to do that that we we and and and and all all the the the the the
but for about weeks weeks , we we been , we we we to to the the , , my my my my my my my , , , and and and . . .
it &apos;s called called the and you you can see see .
this is a cheap analysis that we bought on the the of of of , , something something some some some some some of of of the the the the the the the
we took a a of , you have have have have you have have have have and and and and and and we we a a a a that it it it it it it use use use use use use use use use software software software software software
so we have a device that is completely free free of . .
no insurance can be the ,
not hospital hospital .
now , the can actually communicate alone with eyes eyes eyes or .
thank you .
thank you very much that was was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back back back in room
i love this picture because because it &apos;s room of somebody and and &apos;s his room .
now , &apos;s all of these these of of big big big
and after about year year of care , two weeks weeks , , , , , , , , , , , the the the first time . . .
and this is a amazing picture , because this is his support , and he looks his life life .
we &apos;ve been bed bed bed , so can can can out
we &apos;ve a a a a a a of of the the the the the
and he was back to the first time in the the of his family family friends and and can can can imagine what what a a was the the parking parking parking parking
so , of , we we to to to to the parking parking , , we we we as of of of of of the
and the end , he &apos;s a email with the with of content content : &quot; the first first time years years i . . .
i &apos;ve feeling i i was was to water water and and and someone , to and and and head head i i i breathe breathe .
is that not overwhelming ?
this is like something our our our .
it &apos;s us us on the the and and us us us
and we need to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a a of .
and somebody who has a that of potential potential , so so much much
so we &apos;re out out figure out how you better better faster faster faster faster
since this time , we all have kinds of of of .
we won a few few few .
think , it &apos;s free , no of us us on us .
it &apos;s all from our own pockets .
so the boreal were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong &apos;s about us and and , , , , , the the the the the of of of of 50 the , , center , center was was was was
the most thing thing is is -- -- that that that the whole whole -- that that that that , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , of of of of of of of of the the &quot; of &quot; of &quot;
and there &apos;s probably be be be the of of of of of of of of the of the of the of of of of of of of of of of of of of of these are
and , of is part be be be be be be is is is . . . . . .
so basically , i &apos;s about you you you something something is impossible impossible impossible it it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this computer , the driver , the was was was . .
do it possible -- all all all .
i &apos;m not a checklist and i never never something something with with with , , but i i i i i i with with with with with with with with with we could could could something something .
and this question should be everyone of you you and and every every every day day you you you you to to to be if if if if if if if if if if if , , , , i i i
thank you .
so , i write for children , and probably probably america america most of of of
and i always say people people i i &apos;t to to to a scientist scientist
you can have me as farmer , or in , , but nobody ever ever . .
today i want to tell you from circles and and .
well , a a is for usually something something you you you because because it somewhere somewhere somewhere
you &apos;re about the block and it it it as .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends has made -- richard richard .
it &apos;s the kind complicated of complicated of that i want to tell you today .
my circle started at the 60s in the the school school school school school school , , , , where i i was
i was a one who was to week week the the the and blue blue and was a teacher my my my my
they saved my life by using me the the the the the the the the
they did they ,
they did three three years years
and i had to go away out the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it was to to san francisco francisco -- -- -- -- -- -- -- and the the the the the the the the the i i i a work work of of of
about three or four years ago , i &apos;ve a the of the the the the the , the , , , , , , , , , i you you you .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve know any any adults adults adults

and i should mention that i have a to to , and and i i to to to to to to to to
now , the the next day we we in in .
we saw them , we we , we we we we we we we that have be be in in . .
we found one for them , we put them them and we we we we to them and and and and them family family family because because because because needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed needed
it was something that we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to learn me as adults adults , , , , , into a a of of of of and my my my my my my my my
what happened was was was the circle was closed , it was was a -- -- and and and i talked talked talked talked .
the is is , death is part part life life .
she &apos;s saved my life , and my partner and i i her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything everything needs the rest rest life life
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that that was so so that .
he needs needs needs he he needs , , love and and and and it &apos;s to to to . .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , while they put on on 1,000 feet .
imagine a airplane full of smoke .
imagine a motor , the stick , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
it sounds fear .
now , i had a unique place on this day , i sat sitting on on .
i was the only who could talk about the the thing .
so i saw them at , and they said , , , no problem problem , have have have a a . .
the pilot had been the machine and and we we not so far away
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things at the same same .
the pilot came the machine machine the the river river .
this is usually the summit .
he turns the larvae .
imagine a a airplane airplane .
and then he said three words -- the the words words i i heard heard heard heard
he says , &quot; the to to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the with the the .
i could see it in your eyes , because was was , , life life .
i &apos;m to tell you three things that i learned learned learned day day .
i learned that in a moment everything everything .
we have this these of , we we have have things things we we we we we we and and i i i i i i wanted to to to to to , , , , , , , , , , , , , , to to ,
while i was about this , i i a a a a , , , &quot; i i bad bad .
because if the wine is as as and and person is , , i i . .
i never want to move more something in life .
and this incident , this goal , my life really changed changed .
the second thing i learned learned this day -- and that was when we we the george bridge bridge , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , i i really really
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , with my mistakes , i i to to to better better to to everything i i i
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve have my my space .
and i &apos;m going to that that that i to to to of of things things things things something something something . .
and i thought the the relationship with my wife , friends friends people .
and then , when i thought about this , i decided to to , energy of my my .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t have any years with my my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to do more , right , i i to to happy happy happy .
the third thing i learned -- and it &apos;s the the the the the clock , 15 15 15 , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
you see the water .
i said , &quot; please in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing thing in 20 20 20 , how how know it out .
while we &apos;re , , i had this feeling , , , , not not not not .
almost so as we we we to to our our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness really really in a thought , that that i i i just just one . .
i wish i i i my my can my my
about a month after i went a a of my daughter daughter -- -- , much of of of
... yet .
and i &apos;m going to give i i a a little kid . .
and in the world , everything of sense sense for for me
i was by by by the points , that that it in in life life be be be be .
more than everything everything everything else , , my goal goal life life life a good father .
i was not the miracle of of of of day day day day day
i got another gift , which in the the the the the and and and and and . .
my call of all , that today today is : : imagine , the same the your your -- -- -- -- -- -- -- but but it it it
what would they do that they they they because they they they they would forever forever forever
how would you change their relationships and and negative energy in it ?
and more than everything else , they &apos;re the best parents , you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the record is is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want the iran that the bomb .
the most important rover there for the the of of of the the the the the the
the gray boxes , you see here here that are are .
now , if it &apos;s going to to systems systems systems systems , , , control control control and and and and can can can can can lot of of problems with with with
this gray are not walk with with with of ; ; they they they completely completely completely completely .
but if we do it that a effective of a a a a laptop laptop laptop laptop a a a is a a to to to , , , , , &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re . . . business
and that is the planning behind the .
so we start with a a of .
the most of is going in the the the box , , the the and the the the the the of of of of .
this is a of of , right right
i want to tell you how we found this .
when we started our research research six six six , , was unknown which what the sense and purpose of of this this
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , what the the the of part the part part , , , he he he of of of of of of
and it seemed something something bit of with with these these these these these these these these these
the the of our attention and we started a a project project we we we our our with with , and and and and this this
and then something happened happened .
and paper , like a a a , , , &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t , -- -- , , but &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t . .
this was &apos;t my my my my .
and after we had with with of of of of , , , that that that that a more more more .
completely on a particular goal .
the most thing is on on the the the the the box box was discovered discovered particular , , , when when when particular , , to to to to to to to to
and if not , then , &apos;s &apos;s &apos;t .
so , the cover really my interest interest we started started work , almost almost almost about , , i i i , , , we know know what goal goal
it could say , say , , example , , an american american american , or or a in germany . .
so we should figure out to what what the goal goal .
so , the and and and and and and and and and and and that that that he in two digital digital digital digital a a a and and . .
and we also went that they were very very professional , people who who all all the of of of information
they knew all pieces and and they they they they they to .
probably they know knew the the of of the the &apos;s .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve been that the the of of the the complex complex and and , , me me me me , the the the science science science science science science science science science
it &apos;s much more more more than everything everything we ever ever seen
here you see a clip of this this code code .
we &apos;re talking about about about about lines lines .
so , like how like like like .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be able this this .
so what we looked looking to first , , , , , , , , we we we we what what do . . . . .
and then we looked looking to to and and and and and and and to to to to to to the world world world -- -- in in the real real real real real real real real real world world world world world world world world world world world
so we needed theories about these goals that we could could or or or .
to make this theories , we call in in memory that it &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s to to to to , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , because because because because because because because because
now , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand of .
basically , it &apos;s out the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
so i said to my assistant , &quot; let me a list of of of of for for and and and our . .
and i called them and and you know know to to their their with what what we we we the the the the the the the the the
and that worked very good .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital of the the the the the the in .
the dung is moving moving moving the the the , , black , that that you .
and if you put the speed of this this of , , you actually actually able able to to to to and and and and and and the .
what we also found that that the goal of the the actually actually , , , and and to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to be be be be
the big digital of -- we we a a , by , , data data data and and and .
so for example , number number of the is is out out out this , , can can &apos;t &apos;t it it . .
i started to scientific literature literature , , this this this this in in in in and and found found out out they they to to , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
so this did sense , it it together together
and it was better .
these shrimp in iran are divided in 15 15 .
and guess what we found in the the the the ?
one almost identical structure .
so again , that &apos;s really good together .
and this gave us great confidence for that we we . .
well , you don &apos;t understand me wrong that didn &apos;t just just .
these results were been by by weeks weeks . .
and often we just went up in a and and to to to to
anyway , we found that both digital digital in in in in and the same goal same goal , but but different different directions . .
the little of of a a a a a , , and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and
so , in the big , all , we are very that that we actually actually what what goal goal goal
it &apos;s a of of of it it it &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s
so we have &apos;t have to worry that that other goals could be be of of
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that discovered discovered discovered -- -- really really the the the
there &apos;s the gray box , and you see see the the the the
now , what this thing is is that it &apos;s the the of of of of -- -- example example example example example of of of and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and , , , , , , , ,
and in fact , this false is taken taken data data of of earlier before
so it &apos;s exactly like like in in in where where the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
that is cool , isn ?
the idea is obviously not just that the the the in the the .
in fact , it &apos;s a lot dangerous dangerous and and
the idea is to to a digital of of .
we need digital of of there where where human human can &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t enough enough enough
so in a power station , example , if the big of to to to to to to to to to to to to . .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human of of
so , this need we we we digital digital .
and if the death are , , you really really things things .
the power pattern can .
and neither the the thing , , the the &apos;s thing it it . .
this is scary .
but it &apos;s still worse . worse
and what i &apos;m going is is very . .
think about this . this attack is is of of
he doesn &apos;t have to do with with with with with with with with
so he he just work well well well well -- -- in a a in in a a
it &apos;s a of of of
and you don &apos;t have to -- -- the the lightning -- you don &apos;t have to get the the of a a a a a , we we we . .
you could also use ordinary to technology technology .
you just have to spread it so far as possible
and if you do that , you get a a a of mass .
this is the consequence we we to ask ourselves .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals for such attacks in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the the common environments .
we need to ask the consequences , we we better to better better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was been much of of that people people that the the the the the is is
is that also your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
my think is the the the the the the , but the is is is is not . . . .
so the driving force behind behind is the the .
there are just one and that are the united states -- for happiness , happiness .
because otherwise our problem would even even bigger .
thank you , you have a a of a . thank thank thank you .
i spent spent last few years years to to me , that usually very very very very and same same same same .
i went in prison -- hard .
i worked worked in a a -- dangerous dangerous
i filmed in in in of -- -- and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days with this nothing this this this -- -- -- -- -- , , , little difficult difficult difficult the the the the the the the the the the
i actually have to the the part of my career career to to to to , and and , to to to to to to to to to and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and you
so when i knew that i would come come to at in a the the the world world of the of , , , , i i i would something something something little little little bit bit
some of you may heard that that i i a a a a a a a a in .
i put a few of of of of some some some some some , , and people people the the the the to to to to to to
really , some happy people and companies , , , , , , , , , , , opportunity , i i i i i chris chris chris that that that to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to the
so what you got was , this , name name here , , my my my , , you you &apos;t &apos;t idea what what be the , , and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the , , ,
but it &apos;s , it &apos;s a very good good global .
you know how many people are at these tedtalks ?
a whole amount .
this is just the the of thing the
so despite this this , i knew that someone would buy the the the
now , if you asked asked asked year year year year i i &apos;t able able able to to to to . . . .
but in the new project i i work work my new new , , we the world of of marketing , . .
as i said , i &apos;ve going to in in the the the in some some some , , but couldn couldn me me me me me anything anything something something , so so , so , so , so like like like like . . . . .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is a film about about about about of of , , , , , , , the the the the the the the the , , , , and and and and . . . . . . . . . . . .
and the film is going &quot; the the the the the the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so what happens the the the the the the the the the the is is is , , , , , , , the the the the the the the the the the the the , , , , , , , , , , the the the the
now this brand , that the the , , the the the center center
these guys are be to be with the movie in the -- forever forever
and so the film is going to the whole this -- is is ? in in , , ? ? ?
i &apos;m a a person person .
that was more to the . .
it was &quot; in arguments , for . . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just to have the brand x as a a x , , we we we we we we we we we we to to in in in in
so we might sell a lighter and he &apos;s the the the the the , that have have ... ...
the biggest car that they &apos;re the the , the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the , have have of of of of of of of of the the the the the
so the idea is to show of that that brands is part part life life , , , to to to to film film
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole is is transparency .
they &apos;ll going to see the whole thing in the movie of of of
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning beginning end end
and i would be happy , if help help help help to to to .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because i heard heard it , it &apos;s &apos;s the ultimate the for for the . .
but i don &apos;t know how the people people be be be .
have you have perspective perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; &quot; &quot; , because has a negative negative -- but you know how how how
how much money is it to to that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet it , , i i i think it it &apos;s &apos;s it , , , , , , , . . . . . . .
who knows when the film comes out out , , we see like a a a .
what do you believe how the answer will be ?
the answer is going to be &quot; &quot; &quot; .
but is it a difficult thing of of the of the the or a difficult of of
yb : both .
so ... so , not optimistic optimistic .
so , my gentleman , you can help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands .
yes .
if you look at people people they do do do do
there are some questions that we can apply .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera of &quot; would that we we wanted to a a a .
it turns out that it meant in , , , we want to do with with to to . &quot; &quot;
and just this this all these companies , , after the other .
no wanted to do something with the film .
i was amazed .
they wanted to have absolutely to to do with the project
and i was confused , because i thought that whole concept concept idea idea idea of of , product so so many many many many as as many many as as as as as
especially in the world today , in this interface of new new and old and and the -- -- -- &apos;s not the idea idea idea , that that that that that that that that that that to to
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea was a a of mistake , and was was .
and , , that was was the the the .
that would &apos;t have all problem problem .
that would have okay .
but that is what this picture is is a problem .
look , if you &apos;re transparency at the the of the the is is is is one one one one first first that . .
i really like your kind of sergey sergey .
this was the problem : transparency -- free from deception and and of of , , , , , , , , , , , , , to , information , , , , , , , , , , , , the the the the the the biggest
you know , we hear going a whole whole about transparency .
our politicians say it , president , , , even even our our .
but if it comes as that it it be be be be , , change .
but why ? well , transparency is fear to -- -- this this , , that that .
it &apos;s a of of of of strange . . .
and it &apos;s also very .
what else else ?
a whole dish cool cool food food food
this is very very .
so when i started talking talk the companies and you tell tell that we tell tell tell story story story , , , , , we want want you you story story .
we want you to tell you a story , but we want want to to our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid , and my father me me me me me -- and he sitting he looks at at at at at , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , three three . . .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film we we wanted to tell the real version .
but there &apos;s just a company , a passive ready ready to help help help -- and just , because john john john , since since since since -- i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i to
so what you started to understand -- or what i started to understand understand -- , when you start start start start with to , , , , , , , , , , , , a . .
i have friends who do big big , , , , and and i i friends friends little little little little i i
and my friends , the big , giant of , , , say that reason why why why are are are so so , , the that they they they have
and then my friends say , little little little , , , , , , well , , , we , , , big big big big ? ? ?
and the film is called &quot; the the of thing the the &quot;
so how exactly we going to see in the the movie ?
and i i do to the way , and and , i i the the the , , you &apos;ll &apos;ll going to to
and every time i &apos;m somebody somebody , , , , , , , , &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re enough for for this
they &apos;re as ? you see a little nervous nervous .
i want to help you to down down .
so you should be a little bit of this little of of of of of of
and then we offer one of these great of of . .
either , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you you choice choice .
we &apos;re going to be both for men as women women women -- -- , , , , , , , , , whatever whatever .
this is the most powerful .
now i can answer all their questions questions and you give a a of of
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
so , you talked about about the smaller films , we we as a a a a .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands brands .
so this things do do -- you know , people people -- -- -- that is is we we &apos;re in in in .
what are words describe describe you ?
and is a .
this is a great question .
and technology .
technology is not the way of describe you should should that that somebody to .
we talk talking about , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh is a great word that that category are really really something something positive positive , , , , , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s going fresh .
as can we keep them longer , -- better -- , , , , , , .
these things have a mental impact effect .
and that is a a of .
what about me ? what is the the the ?
i have to talk about the man on the street , that are like i i i .
you should tell me about my my my .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like to really beautiful clothes .
&apos; , the , , the the , the the the the the the
now , what is the brand of ?
unique .
i think that the the thing thing , the , , i i , , , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
i like many lot colors colors , many of of and so so stuff .
but usually i have a a of , , , , , , or or or and and and .
when dan would be a brand , he would probably a classic classic .
man 2 : the brand i i &apos;m , , i say say , , , fly fly fly
wife 2 : , , , , , , , , , , , i i i know know know know
man three : i &apos;m the most powerful .
i &apos;m going to the the whole country the the world world world
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , , industry industry .
man four : my brand is delicious because i were a bit of
man 5 : brand &apos;s of of
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a a of .
i &apos;m tom .
now , we can &apos;t be all the the of , but i i i i the the the of of of of of of and and
and what &apos;s noticed that i needed a experts .
i needed someone who could put my my my head someone somebody help help help help help understand what &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so i found a company called called in in in in
they have companies like the , , , , , , , , , , , , , of of of
if you could do it for the , they could help help help .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i &apos;ve that . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just me just a little bit , how with with your thoughts and and and them . . .
these are the people that my my forms .
tell me about this world .
so , the world world world world ? think think world world world world world world world world world world live live -- people people people people who who who who , , , , , , , , , , , work work work work work work work
all these things things and start start a place , and for me and and start start with my my in in virginia virginia virginia virginia virginia
what is the next thing you want to talk about it .
the next thing this this the beautiful beautiful day my my life
so context is that the the idea and emotions about about ?
it &apos;s like i want to be like .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are the . i like like things .
tell me about why &quot; why &quot; &quot; &quot; what what what what ?
what is the most powerful ? where are are are are ? ?
why is it important , the ? ? what the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit about about you you not not not .
what else of have they have through ? ?
... doesn &apos;t be to be fear fear . what kind of are they you
so , no , , , thank you you you you
thank you very much for your patience .
yes . well . well .
yes , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be .
there was very lot of crazy crazy things things
the first thing i saw was this idea that that their their two two , , but but but but , , the the is is is a a a a of of of of of
the instructions good very good
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with this .
and i think some companies are just focus on on strength , rather on on both .
many companies tend to -- that that the human nature -- things they they they &apos;re &apos;re sure they they &apos;re to to to , , , and and and they they they they and and they and they and they and they and and and and and and
what other brands are so ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , , , , , , , , of of of of and
now , there are a brands of brands and , , , these things come come come , , , , , , , , , , a very very very very . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
one a of , , brand brand brand brand how how brand brand
if someone ask ask to describe their their their their their their , , , they they ? ?
they &apos;re a a of ? you you you that that blood blood into into into ? ? ?
or are they more a more of ?
are they something that a little little quiet quiet , , , , , ,
the , are things things things are are are are are , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
or are they more like a a of ?
are they a and and of of of
are they , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
are they reliable , robust , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , dalai lama lama
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies , were were the and and and and , , , , , didn didn didn &apos;t to to of of of project
they wanted &apos;t want to have anything with this this this because because they &apos;t have control control control control control control product .
but i discovered 17 to to to willing willing to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to , and and and and and and and and and we we we we we to to to we we we we we we
they &apos;re going to tell us the story story story the the the the the the we we the story story that that that that that that that &apos;re to to to to to the the the the the the the the the the the the the
we went to oakland paulo , where &apos;s was produced .
in the entire city , it &apos;s not been years years years years years , , , , no no no no no .
and we went up school , companies companies their their their their in in in in in in in america america america
the incredible for me is that the projects of i have the of of , where where i the the the , , , , where i things things things things things things
and that is what these brands did done .
because they &apos;re the the the of , , they they the the the , , said that the the not not really interest interest interest sense sense sense
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artists right .
i &apos;m going to work with him and something something completely else something something that that people that that that that our our . . . . . .
and how was that do ? what it it successful ?
now , there the the film film film film film film , , we we at at at .
according loud to the the was the the the the january , , and and and that not not even whole whole thing -- -- million million million million this this this
this is actually just a period of two one two two two .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film was not not to .
there &apos;s not even online online online not .
it &apos;s not come out in other countries .
well , finally , the film big a very big big .
and that is not bad for a project where almost almost every single , with we we talked , their their , to to of of .
something that i think is is that if you to to to to chance , risks risks that that these these these . . .
i think if you &apos;re people people them , you you them to to . .
i think if if you to employees employees employees , risks , , , the the company company to to a a
i feel that that we to to encourage to people people people risks risks risks risks
we need to encourage people , have fear fear have have you you might might to to
finally , in the , we we to to to to to
we should put the bear in the korean .
it you fear to to . it it to .
so a big of full , , so we we to to risk risk
and finally , we should welcome to to . .
today , more than ever before , us us a little little of of . .
and that said , with with , transparency , my my talk , &quot; talk &quot; &quot; &quot; to to to to to my my friends friends friends of of of of of of the the the the the the
big data will going to to for the the world world world world .
and , &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency : what is what happening the the the the ?
this is a great question .
i &apos;ve a jump in my pocket , , on the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the of of of of of of of of of to to the the the the

but i &apos;m going to focus on the the the .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did done .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and and access .
i grew up in india .

i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and you you some interesting interesting things that happened to the . .
so you &apos;re just to to to
you can go around in these these museums .

here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best thing is -- in a second .
let &apos;s jump to the , , , new new york .
another of of me , , , ,
the the the example , it was about the , .
but what if you want to see the key ?
and what if you want to see like van is like van this this this this ?
you &apos;re in in in you you can can go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom in one of my my of this picture , i i really to to the
this is a of of , never never never never never . .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function function .
there &apos;s many other , but but i missing the . .
this is really cool amazing , he &apos;s &apos;s .
every of you , everybody -- same , even or poor whether whether whether you a a house -- -- -- matter matter
you can go and online online their own museum -- from all these these these can can their own collection .
just , you go in -- and i created created this it it it power power power of of -- you you can can
this is the most thing thing , in the the the
you can be everything with with , their friends , , and and conversation conversation conversation what you you you you they they at these these .
i think , , , for the the the the the the the the things things things things things .
they don &apos;t even come my the the the .
i may &apos;t say that .
they come from artists artists .
and that was a experience in the for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to to this this digital medium of art , and they online online online .
and the biggest question that that me me me me me , &quot; you you that that to experience experience experience experience experience of ? ? ? &quot;
the answer is is . .
it &apos;s supposed to experience the experience .
it &apos;s what . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of their brain . your brain can be distributed in two . .
this is half left half that is the the side and then the half half half the the is is .
if we have a scale to measure the the of every , , , could could your brain brain brain brain
for example , this someone , that is completely completely .
this would be somebody that is completely .
now , where would you get your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have have one one of these extreme freedom , i i think most people the the audience audience audience , , brain like like -- -- , , , , , the the the the the the the the the
it &apos;s not as they &apos;re both both both or like like .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i see myself one of the people , together with the other other other other the , , a good good good , , to to complex complex ideas ideas . .
but the the same time , we need a good percentage intuition to actually the experiments .
so we we these intuition ? well , we love it with play things .
so we go out and play and and and and it it it and and and and we we we our our . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
basically , they &apos;re the same .
so one of the main of you &apos;ve developed about the years , probably that that thing thing thing thing be time time time place place place place place place place place
i mean , it can think about about that that thing thing thing thing time time two places places places places , , they they they have have they they they they they they . .
i remember to a child in play a a a a
he was another a and and not very good good it he he he .
but i bet it it play play with very very very very very very very very , , , big , things just just just , and and they they they &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re . .
and that is a great of model of the world world , so long they not not a .
it would be a terrible model for a a model because because they &apos;t play play play with with , , with little little . . . . . . .
and if you play with their particles , you all kinds kinds of weird things -- like they they directly through through or or they they can be same same two places places places places places places places places places places
and so they wrote all these fibers , and called called the theory theory theory theory .
this was the one of the physics of a years ago ; you took mechanics patent to describe little small small .
but you didn &apos;t needed them about the big everyday objects objects describe us .
that doesn &apos;t have my intuition , and maybe just because because because i i often often with with .
well , i &apos;m play with you , , but not often often .
and i never never seen them .
i mean , nobody ever ever a a .
but my logical side has &apos;t &apos;t it .
because if all things are are particles particles and all these these the the the the mechanics theory theory , , not all all rules rules the the theory theory theory ? ? quantum theory theory
i don &apos;t see why that should &apos;t be that .
so i would feel better better with the whole thing , we could could of that that that that that rules rules the mechanics mechanics mechanics quantum
so i made at few few years years , this this .
i created one .
this is the first object that you can see that that was in the the the
so what we &apos;re at at is a tiny computer computer .
and you can see this green point there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i i &apos;m going to talk the the .
this is a picture of the object .
here i &apos;m it it something . we &apos;re at at at the . .
and here &apos;s a really big big of this little piece of metal .
so what we look at a little piece piece of metal it it is like a a and and it about the the the .
so i made this thing on similar way that you a computer computer computer .
i went a a room with new new room , and and of of , , hours hours hours the the the . . .
i the last bit i i i i build my own machine machine -- this like a a a a and and and and thing .
this thing has to be the ability to be the ability of the the but but it a a little little help help . . .
look , let me give you a analogy .
you know how how is it to be a a a a elevator
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i all do all sorts of things things things things things people people and i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i to to to , , , , , ,
so quantum says that that objects of like like like .
the brazilian for the are of objects are not not people , but the light light you you you you the wind wind wind wind the the the the the the the the the
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece piece of metal is , , , we we we we we the of
and that &apos;ve that .
we &apos;ve taken light light , it it it into a vacuum and and the whole and and air and and to to to to , , , , , , , the the the the the the the the the the
so we &apos;ve his movement .
we realized that it really move . .
instead of it it just just quiet , , &apos;s &apos;s , of of of of it it of of of of like like like like like like like like like of of of of of of of
in that we a a little little little little , , could could could it it to time time time time , , -- -- something to to to the the the mechanics mechanics mechanics quantum quantum
so what i &apos;m just going what what what what fantastic .
what does it mean to to a object time the same time not not to
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion of atoms atoms that that is the of of of , , the the same same same same same same same and and .
just to the , , , you &apos;re . .
the rest of time are they of of .
that means that every atom is the same time time two different different different which is is is is is whole whole of of of of different different places places places places places places places places places places places places places places places places places places places places places
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
this was worth me for all of the year in the the room room , , , , , , , , the the the a a of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of the the the the the
so if a single atom can be be the the same two two places places , , piece of of of of of places places places , why not &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t
i mean , this &apos;s just what my my side page .
so , imagine you would to time time time time places places like like would would
how would you deal with your your that your body room room room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
when we &apos;re it it the the the light light light light light the the the box box the the the the the the the the of of of of of
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like as all the the the the the in in in in in in in in in in small small small small space space .
they hear a lot of about about how mechanics says says that everything everything everything everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more more , it &apos;s deeper .
it &apos;s so that connections connections , their connections with all the things things around them , they they are and and and and and and and and the the quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum quantum
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we we should should to about about about about economic economic economic economic
it should be our goal that if families about about about where they live live live to to to to to to to to to to to to to of of of of of of of of of of of of new .
now , we &apos;re far from from from from .
there are billions of people in developing developing developing developing developing not not not only only city city to to to to to
but the amazing amazing about cities is that they are so much more more than than it .
so we could just the the world simple with with with of , maybe maybe of of of of new .
now , may may absurd for you you you you never never been been new . . .
it it just building building from from from the from from .
imagine half of people who want to live in in in , , already already other other other half yet yet
they could try to expand capacity capacity of the . .
but you know what you would be to to to , , , , and and environment environment environment to to to to and and
so it turns out very very very of of these these of of
but you could go to a new new place , a new new new new , , the laws would would be a help and and it it it
so i proposed that governments create create new new that that enough to for for city city city and you you , , , . . . .
later , i found that about about same same time , , , , , , , , of of of of of of in . .
they knew that every year about the of of to to to to country to the united states states and and they you know know what to to to to to that that that that that that that that that that that that can the the the the the
on this point of , , , , , , , , , , , , , , when we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we , , , , , , , , , , ,
in summer 2009 , , was a a a a .
the next next of elections , , won won in in a a , a , , , , both , as as as
he asks to be be be be be be be
in the meantime , i &apos;m to to a talk in . .
by improvement , try and and through study study of , , i i to to to to to to to the the the the the the .
the first point , is importance importance of laws laws laws that that you &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t have have to .
we &apos;re going to new big attention , but for for progress it it and and and and and and and for laws laws that us us . .
in the fall 2010 , a friend of the , of the the the the the .
again , it showed him him
the two called me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head head our our country ! &quot;
so we met in the in the the in the in in in .
i tried to do to how valuable cities are , how how much valuable valuable they they they .
and i used this chart to show how valuable is is a a place place place a , , , , of of a a a a a of a of of dollars dollars dollars dollars dollars dollars
but it was a pretty abstract discussion on on on a a a a , , , , , , , , , , , , we maybe maybe the the . . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the warrior has in very very form form that a a city is is place place is is the beginning the the , , , , , , that that that that that that that that that that that that the to to to to to to to
so i asked asked by from president president of of of that that that that we to that project project that that that that that is is is is to to to to to to to to
i was asked to come to to to and and and and and fourth fourth fourth fourth fourth . .
so i &apos;ve to to a with with facts facts , a a a graph graph that that that that to to to to you you you you to to a city city city city city city city city city city city city city city city city city city
this is a picture of the city , and and the the the the new airport , that was built in in
alone alone this airport airport has a a of 100 100 .
so i tried to convince the the of of to if you want to build a new city city you to to start a a of of least least least .
these are more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
evan have all the of of .
the faces of the audience were very serious and attention .
the head of the was came the stage and and said said professor professor professor , , you you you you you you , but but but might the the the the . . .
i &apos;ve him him on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat up , and they &apos;ve the the . .
and i &apos;m come to the line line that a new city city new new new new .
it would be the possibility to live the city in a city who would be in , rather of of of the north .
and a new city is also new new new leaders leaders with .
the leaders of government in the in in the help help on the , , , could could their their their their their the the the the the the the the the the that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that that
and the realization of president , , the confidence of the the of the the i i i as to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to for for for for for for for for for for for for for for fear
we &apos;re going in a area .
this picture is from this place .
it &apos;s out thousand thousand kilometers kilometers .
and shortly after , the the the the the the , , , you the the for for for for change a a a a a of that that that for special special special
in a country , that &apos;s just a a crisis crisis behind , , in congress to to to to to to to a . . .
all parties , all of the of society society , , . .
to become part of the , , it to to to to to to to congress .
at the 17th february , it was to to to second time with a . .
immediately after this choice between between the 21st and the february february , , a a of about 30 30 the the the the the the the world world in in the the the the the the the the the the the the
the place is north .
this is a picture of a big , new new , , that built built in south the the the the the the the the
everything you can see on this picture picture , within four four years years after after years years to to to .
the other place that was interested in in the the , singapore singapore
it has taken two cities in china and and the third is in . .
so if you &apos;re about about it it it it where we we today today today
they already already a a of ; and you &apos;re &apos;re the the the the the the the . .
it &apos;s already been on a a system that that that allows allows to to to to and and and it it a a . . .
a country has been to to his his of of to to to to to the the the the the the the the
also , , , , very very very very very very in
they even bring funding with a .
one thing , you already already already already already , , , there many of of of
there are many of that would like to in in america america america especially especially in a a a , , , , there people like like like live live live live . . .
in the whole world , there are 700 million people who who want to to to to to to to to place place place
a million people leave america america america america america america the united states states states
many of you are fathers who are forced to to their families , to to to to to to , , , , , , money money enough money money money money to and and . . .
unfortunately , sometimes &apos;s sometimes kids kids to try to parents parents parents parents they they in in in cases , , decade decade decade decade . . .
so what is it to to to about a idea about a a new new new city city
or even even of of cities cities cities cities , or , of the the world world world
so what is it for a idea to to that every family family family choice choice between between between in in in in new
this is a idea that spread worth .
my friends from suicide have asked me say , thank you ted
you know how many decisions do do do a a typical ? ?
you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve made a survey with 2,000 2,000 and and and the number of of decisions that the a a a a a a a a of is
and was was was study study a with with with , they they week week week week
and these scientists just presented the different topics with with that that these these , and much much much much much much they with with with with with with . .
and they found that a average ceo in the the in week week week with . .
every of these themes of of course many many many many smaller .
50 percent of their decisions were met within nine minutes or less less .
just about 12 percent of their decisions they they they a hour or more their time .
think about their own decisions .
you know how many decisions you meet in the nine minutes in the the the the hour hour hour hour
how good , think , you &apos;re to to to decisions decisions ?
today i want to talk talk one of the largest largest largest largest largest modern , , the the the .
i want to talk about the problem and and some of of solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions questions i want want want to . .
if i &apos;m you a question , you , , , i i i , , , , , , want want to to calories calories calories
otherwise , please you you if i you you you question question , and your answer , , , , first first first question question &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re to to hear hear hear about about the the
thank you .
when i was a a of the university university university university i i went very very very very very very at at at least at at at at at at at at at at at at
it was a store that was the the the the
this business , it was almost like a a of .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and and and over different different types of of and and and and more than than than two of of of of and and and and and and we we we we actually
i &apos;ve it to this this business , but i a a time i i i , , , , , you you you you something ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
here &apos;s the oil station .
they had over 75 different of of oil oil oil including that that were were in were were were old old old old old
so i decided to leave the day , , i i i the the , &quot; &quot; this this that that that that that all all these these ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
and he showed on the the of of the , that every day day and and and their their .
we decided to get a experiment company companies we we we our our experiment .
here &apos;s your your mountain mountain .
they had different kinds of of species of of
we have going a little of of of the the the the the the
we have been six different of of of of , , different , , , we we &apos;ve two things things things things , , , , i i i i i more more more to to and and
it &apos;s more people are , when it were 24 , about 60 percent percent when when was six six 40 40 40 percent
and then we we looked in the the people people people a a glass glass
now we saw the the effect .
and people are are were were were were , , three percent percent percent a a glass
from people who are were than than were six , , now we we we 30 30 percent of of actually actually a glass glass glass
now , if you calculate it , people people more more times a glass glass glass who they they had had had , when when they they they they . .
now , to choose not a glass to to to to for for for for -- least least least &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s -- -- -- but but it it it it it that that that that that very very very very . . .
we don &apos;t decide decide decide even even it &apos;s our our own best best best
so for the issue of the day : markets .
now &apos;m going to describe you a study that i i with with with of of of of , , , , , , , , , , , , we we we we we we we we to to to of of of of of of of of
and what we looked at , the number number of the the , the the a a a a a a a a a that that that , , , to to to to to
and we found that it was a a context .
so in these plans , we had about the of of plans the the people people to to two two two two .
and what we found was that the more more were were to that that that in was was was .
now , you you look at the extreme , the plans , two two two two two , , , , , , , , , , , , we we we we . . . . .
in the plans , the almost to to 60 60 , , the the the the the the the the the the the
now , out out even even if you to to to to more more more , , , , , , , , , , implications consequences consequences consequences consequences consequences consequences consequences consequences consequences consequences consequences consequences consequences consequences consequences consequences consequences consequences consequences consequences consequences consequences consequences
so the people that that to to to to more more more more more more more more more more more more more more they they they to to to and to . .
the more possibilities you them to , , more more more they their money money in in in
no of these extreme decisions , to the decisions that who people people people people people if their own own own . . . .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen at three three three implications implications consequences that that that that more more and choices choices .
they &apos;re the decision -- it them on , even even it &apos;s your your own best best best .
they &apos;re more more decisions decisions -- , financial and health medical .
they decide more more things things they they less less less less even even if it it objective musical .
the main of this this is that we might might it to this huge huge huge full full , , , , , , , , , , , , we , , and and and and and and and and and and and and and the
so what i want to suggest you today today are four simple techniques -- techniques techniques that we we on different different different different different different -- -- -- -- can can just business business business business
first , : .
they &apos;ve heard heard before , it it was was true than than than than more more
people are always worried when i say , &quot; &quot; . &quot;
they &apos;re always worry they they lose lose to .
but in fact , we &apos;re it more more more more more more they they &apos;re willing to to to to to and and and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
when a a of and and and and different different of of of of of of of of , , , , , of of of 10 10 10 10
when the golden of the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of
you know , the average of the , , , you you products products products products
a typical mystery gives you today today products .
but the most of supermarket , that &apos;s is the the the the the the the world world , and and you you , , products products of of of of of of of of
now the the world of the world , , i think of the the the the the the the the the the the market market the the the the the the the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
every single harvard employees takes taking now now a a a of .
and , really want to make a choice , , will , , , , or or or . .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how i i to to it
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i is the employees question , &quot; tell me how the possibilities possibilities ways other other other other
and if your employees don &apos;t get them to , , can can can can &apos;t &apos;t .
now before before we started to , , i had conversation conversation with .
and gary said that he would be ready to be all people in audience audience audience audience the the the the the the the world world
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read you the .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds seconds you you and and and i you you you you you you &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re . .
okay . everybody of the ready is to to , , .
are that all ?
well , let me show you something more of this .
they knew it was a trick of it , right
well , who is ready for this journey .
i think i may hear heard more hands .
good .
the fact is that that at at at , time time time time time time time time time time , i i i would it it it it it it second second second second second second second second . . . . . . . . . . .
because the images was it for for real .
what &apos;s me to to second second technology that help help with with with problem problem the the , , &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s the &apos;s &apos;s
it &apos;s about that people to understand the difference between opportunities , understand understand what what are with the the the , , , and and and and and and and to to to and . . .
why are people to 15 15 15 30 percent percent , if you use a a a a a a a a
because it &apos;s not feel feel . .
and it turns out that if you it it that something something something a a a good good tool tool , you you to to save save . .
so we have in a study that i made with with with of of of and and and , , a a a a with people people of of -- -- -- -- -- -- , , all all were all were were were were were were were were
and while this meeting , we have this these to as as they they always , just just a a little bit bit .
the little bit that we we the , , that that we we people people people , , all all all all things to to to to to life would if they save save save save money
in that we , simple simple , , there was a of of of of of and and there there a of of of people were were to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to for for
the third technology : the . technology
we can deal better with more than than than choices choices
here &apos;s example , a study that we made in in a a a .
it turns out that it &apos;s in the the the the the the the and and the the the the the the the the of of of of of of of of of
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 600 and and you you in in cows , , you you you 17 , , and and and and , , , , you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you
because the cows tell me how i can hold them apart apart
here are two different of the .
one is called &quot; &quot; &quot; and the other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you think that the left ad is the , the the the the the the , , , , they they the . . .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
if you think that the on on the left , , the the the the the right side the the , , you you .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out that you &apos;re right .
the left on the left is jazz and the on the right is , , know know know know ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
this is a a of of of
the cows must to say the the of the , the the the the choice .
and this problem you often , you you look at the long of of of these these .
who really want to do with with ?
my fourth technology : interest for complexity .
it turns out that we can deal in with information information information we we we we need need to to . .
we need to increase complexity complexity slowly
i &apos;m show you a example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the buy of a cars .
here &apos;s a german , that you you the opportunity to to your car to to .
you have to make the different decisions to design their car .
now these these decisions are in the number of choice that they offer a decision .
and , , , cars cars cars cars cars -- -- . . .
motors , , -- four possibilities .
so what i do do is , i change the the the the the the . .
half of the customers is going to the the many possibilities , , , , , , , , , . .
the other half of customers is from the low possibilities , four four , , the the of , many ways ways .
what do i look at what ?
how are they interested in
if you &apos;re all the the the the the decision , , that that that they &apos;re to to to , , , , , i i .
what you &apos;re out that people people are to to the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
we lose them .
go from the little little choices to the you you you you .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of opportunities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is the the order the the the information information information .
if i start with the simple start , i &apos;m like i i
even even even the the , , , &apos;t &apos;t about about my my my the , , , &apos;s me me to to
it also put me in the about the product product that i i i i i i i i to to to to to to to to to with .
let me summarize .
i told you you four four techniques that that the problem of the the of the -- -- -- -- -- -- to to to , , , -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- , , , , ,
every of these techniques i i you today today today to you you you to to opportunities opportunities , , for you you you use use use use for for for for for for for for for they
because i think that key key to best best choice is that you &apos;re in the choice .
and the more we are to to to , , better better will be able able able to the the of of .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin , , , , , , youtube youtube , i i i . .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how video video will going to , and and and , that all all .
we all want to be stars -- -- , , , , , , i i was was was was to hard hard . .
but the , have we we we we we we all all all all all of of of of of of of of part part part part part part our our world
every single of you could be famous about the internet to the . .
but in youtube , more than a hours video video video . .
and , this is just a a a a of of of , and and and and and and and and and and and . . . . .

and year , we had no no cents .
at the end of one , , , a a a huge huge , , we we we .

i looked at the the of and saw saw the the other side side side
i knew they was to to to .
my mother called me a few minutes after .

they asked the opera : &quot; why is your hand so so so and the rest rest rest of is cold cold &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;re going to for for &quot; &quot; he said said
&quot; they don &apos;t have them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in a family , a &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s the women .
you see , we we and and and life has us , we we we can that men men men have have have have our our our our would would would would would in in
the fetus would have been . .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i think i the boat .
who would ever ever one wish
yes , i fear afraid fear , , ago ago ago ago ago ago ago ago ago ago
can i give you a ticket in your life who who the every wave wave , , the , , , , , , , , , , that that ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this and and you could be safe to , i i do it
and also , is &apos;s the here here here the the fourth the the . . .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with them .
is it all photography ?
because that &apos;s of picture , you can &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t with with camera camera camera
yet , my interest started photography when i was my first digital digital , in age age age years
i &apos;m it with my former wedding for the , , it was a little bit different , because the the camera camera the process process in the . .
and if you put a picture picture a camera camera camera camera , , process , you you on the the
so for me , it seemed to to to to to to to to to right right right right right right right right right
i believed , everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that the the process process the the the is is
photos like this : a construction on a a a road road
but it has a unexpected phenomenal .
and still , a a a a . . .
or photos like this -- dark and the same of the same , , but all the , , , , , . . .
if i say reality , i &apos;m going to to .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you you can really really , but but i want to to it it like it it you you you . . .
photos that have to think you a quick moment to to find the .
so it &apos;s more about a idea a a a a a a .
what what is the trick that look look it it
is it the the details or the colors ?
is it the light ?
what does the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is illusion .
but then , it &apos;s about how we we world world , and how can can can done on a a of .
it &apos;s not what realistic is , but what we &apos;re for for . .
so i think the the are very simple .
i see you as a puzzle of reality , in you you different parts parts and and to create create alternative alternative reality reality . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect , , objects objects that we can we identify identify in in three-dimensional three-dimensional three-dimensional . .
but in a particular way of each , you can create something that that still still that it it it it
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s possible possible
so we &apos;re our brains , because our brain is not not not not not it it really really sense
and i see the same process in the . .
it &apos;s really just to combine different of .
so the things that look a a picture picture , i think that &apos;s things things we we we think things things things things us us our our . . .
but if we combine photos , it &apos;s really important to think , , because because you just just of of of .
so i would say that there are three simple to to rules rules to a a result .
as you can see , this is not three three images .
but you can make something special like this this .
so the first rule is that that is photos the same same .
second , , should have have same same same same .
and these two images are these two these -- -- the same same and the same same same same .
third , it &apos;s about make it , , where where where where images start start start start start to . .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the picture was actually actually .
so by using , , and and and the the the the images , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , of of of
here &apos;s another example .
you may think that that just a a , , and the part part .
but this picture is completely completely in in , from from of different places places
i personally personally it to it make make make make a place place place place place place because because to to to to to to to to your your your his head head head
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew i i i several months months to to to find find find different the the the the the the
for example , the fish was taken taken a a a .
the bank bank from from another place .
the most thing is from a a .
and yes , i even have the house top on the island island , the the the to . .
so to reach a lighter result , it &apos;s from from from from from from .
i always start with a a , a idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images images
and here &apos;s a piece of very good .
and then you you you good , , , result result beautiful beautiful , , and pretty pretty .
so it &apos;s all tools , , and only thing thing that that us us is our our .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk about you about how why many many many electronic .
and i think the most important point is that we we we to talk with our patients .
and one of the things that we introduced the the the the , , , , , a . .
you &apos;s not particularly , -- you it a a coffee coffee coffee tea tea tea , , patients , , , , , , , , , , ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of of the the , why all all most most most the of electronic electronic of because because because because . . .
this is my favorite thing . a very simple thing .
she has a button , in .
and every morning i woke up this .
and yes , i have a task , how you recognize .
i &apos;ve a job in in pounds pounds .
it works just simple : every time time i i the the the , , , , , , , . . .
and they &apos;re also going to get my my , , so so can can where where where where where is is is not not not not , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , the the the
but there &apos;s something .
maybe you is familiar , i &apos;ve about about 4,000 on twitter twitter .
so every morning i woke on my my my and people people about about i i i i i i car car car car car car , , , , a a a a , , . . &quot;
but that is the most thing thing , what can happen because is is is pressure , , , help help help help help , , could be be be or or could could
but it could also used to to people people from their their their their and and to to to play play play play play of their their their
next next week , this &apos;s the the .
it will give to little little little little little of of that you you you a or or
and it &apos;s going to to people to measure the home pressure pressure pressure , , her her to and and for for for for for for else more more more more
on this point , patients patients come in game game game can can &apos;t just take the control , , , , , , , , , but but but but but us help care care care care care care care care care care care care care , ,
do methods , use easy to use and and start start with with with patients the . . .
and that can reach you through these ways , but also through . .
and one of the things we did we , i want to share with through a quick video .
we all have all of of in our cars .
maybe even in our phones phones .
we know know where all the all are around around around around
we know one where all of of are are .
and right , we can find the of .
but where would next next next thing to help help patients patients patients patients
we have a , of , and and nobody . .
nobody knew where the next mustard was to find the this moment moment
so , what did we we ? we did in in the netherlands .
we built a website and and a a , , &quot; you you you a a , , please you you , where he he he he he he he he because because he sometimes sometimes sometimes sometimes he , , , ,
and over 10,000 , , were were in in the the .
the next step was to find the headlines for this .
and we &apos;ve created a a .
we developed developed a app for a , of , , , reality to to to this
and if you &apos;re in a city like a city , and someone someone someone , you you you your iphone , , and the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
and today we don &apos;t just want to just this as a a as as as product product product product , but but as as as
and we want to bring this on a global level .
and we ask asking colleagues colleagues on the world world , , universities universities , , , , us to to to to to to to to to the the world world world world world
and if you &apos;re in vacation , somebody someone down , it &apos;s own own own or or else else can can can a a
the other thing , we want to ask is that companies is the the the world world the the of of of of
this could be be , , , , , , , , , , , , that that that that that the that the the the the
please us us and try try to to to health health health health , , , but but hand . hand
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the the of .
and my little of the to to to that we we to to to .
... it &apos;s going to to attention attention .
here &apos;s a short video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take , it &apos;s &apos;s .
now -- we can just get that just i i going going to to to to to video video
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
the &apos;s is is ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
oh , my time is already over ?
okay . thank you very much .
so a few years ago , i started a program to to the the in technology technology design and to to to to a a , environment environment environment environment that that which , , , , , , , , , , &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re government government government
the program is called code code for america and and it &apos;s a little bit like the the the the .
we choose a of of of of and we we &apos;re with with with with with
instead of send in the third world , we send them into into in in
and they developed great great , worked with urban employees employees
but what you really do is to show what today today technology possible .
so they meet al .
al is a a of in the city boston .
here &apos;s see when he looks to a a a , , but what &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s he he he he he he he he he he he he &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s
how did he come to look at this particular kind of
we had a team year of in in boston in boston the the code code for for program .
they were there in february , and it has a lot lot of of
and they realized that the city never never these fire .
but a particular description , a man named noah , , , something else else that that that that the the the the the the , , , , . . .
so he did what everybody would do good good , , he wrote a app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can take a fire .
you &apos;re going to free them to him it it it .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , it can take it .
so there &apos;s a nice little game game .
this is a symbolic small app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of 21 dots that have been the in the last last last .
but they do something not not other other other other
they &apos;s going to .
there &apos;s the guy in the the of the the the city city city city city that that that that that that that , , , , , , but but but but but but ,
it &apos;s very important that these these of work , but people people the the the .
so he got the citizens to check it .
and then suddenly to use the app to use the citizens to get the citizens to the the
and chicago , she just introduced it that people people the the the the the the the it .
now we know nine cities , to to use to to these app .
and she has been , , , , , , course course
if you know something about about of of you you you that it not &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t it
the benefits of software takes a few few few few .
we had a team that worked last last year in in project in , for the two two two months months
it went out a a , the parents parents parents the the the the the for for for children .
so was told later that if it would go the normal normal , , would would had two two years years and have two two two dollars dollars dollars
and that &apos;s not nothing .
there &apos;s now project project in california california california that that has has has two two dollars dollars dollars and it doesn doesn &apos;t
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so one app that wrote written in few few days , and then then of of of of of of of of of of of the the the government government government government government government government government government government government government government government government government government government government government
it shows how the government could work better -- not more like a a company company as as people think they they should .
and not even like a a of , but but the internet internet internet . .
and that means access access that means means open and .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , this app is that they represents a new generation that that the problem of the government -- not as the problem of a , , , a of of of collective collective collective
and this is a very good news , because it shows that we &apos;re very good in in collective digital digital digital digital
now there &apos;s a big community of people who are tools tools that we need to things things together together together
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america america , , there hundreds hundreds of people in the country country the the , , , , day day day day own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own
they didn &apos;t get the government .
they &apos;re uncomfortable frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t agree it it it they them them
and these guys know something we lost lost the eyes eyes .
and that is what you you all all your your feelings politics politics and the the the the the the the the the the things things things things we really really , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
today , a lot of people have to to .
and if you are one of those people , i &apos;ll you you you about about of because because because because things . .
politics changes &apos;t change the government government is in change change .
and because the government went to their power of us us -- -- -- -- , &quot; we we people people &quot; we we we how how how how how how this this this this .
i didn &apos;t know much lot about government , i i started this program .
and how many people , i thought it was it in the government in in in in in in office .
now after two years , i &apos;m to to the conclusion that that it in in in in to
this is the reputation for service and information .
there usually out out you you you to to your city city
if you ever ever opportunity opportunity to work the to in the the , , , , , , , , , of the program program -- -- -- -- , , , , , , , , , , , that that that that that that that that
scott gets this this of of .
he &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; the the the the the database .
and he didn &apos;t really have a idea . he starts with the the of .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you can open all the in your your house and and and and and and and that that that the ? &quot; &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn not the end of the the of the .
boston doesn &apos;t just a a competition .
it has a app , a a , and a a , , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t have these app .
this is very work very people in the office of the office of the new new new .
one day -- this is a real report -- came this in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my my my , can say say you you you dead dead
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens happening &quot; &quot; &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &quot; .
scott &apos;s to to human human .
but on the &quot; , &quot; , is is is , , that that that can can can
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next rover we we have , , i i , , , , the the the behind behind behind house house house
the , ? yes , , ? ? ?
turned the the on the side . went after home .
good night , sweet , . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . here &apos;s the digital the the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example , how government government to to the the .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as the platform .
and i &apos;m not necessarily mean a technical of of of .
i &apos;m talking about a platform platform people people help help help help help help others
a citizens helped a other citizens , but the government was a central role .
they &apos;re these two people .
and you &apos;d have them them with with with with , if if needs needs , , but a a a a a a and and and . . . .
if a neighbor helps the other other , , we our communities .
we call the the of , costs it a lot lot money money
one of the most important things that we we to think is is is is not the same is . . .
and most people understand that that that that that that one the the of of the the
that our contribution is to the is is .
how often we have political political leaders -- and sometimes we have a lot lot energy to choose a new political -- and then then then then we we we we we we we we we we we , we , we , , , , , , ,
this is because the government is a on ocean ocean and and that the the the the the
and what &apos;s is is that we call call . .
and we use this word with this judgment .
but it &apos;s this whale that that this thing that we we , and we we we we something something something something against us us , , , , and then then we we we . . .
people seem to think to think politics is sexy .
if we want that institution institution for us us us , we need to make . .
because that &apos;s where the real is is is .
we need to get the the of the government of government
so the most thing has has done .
do you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of offer , that written written a very very very , that who a answer answer the the the the the the the the the the the
this is not active active that is &apos;s active .
now , for those of us who have government government government , it time time that we about about about we we we we we we we we kids kids .
you have to introduce you the enormous challenges you you have to imagine .
do we really think that we we to achieve what we to to do without without institution institution institution that the the the of us us
a government is absolutely necessary , but the needs to be efficient .
the good news is that technology makes possible possible power function function of the the the in in a way can actually something something by by society society
and there &apos;s a generation that is up up the internet internet , and that that that that not hard hard hard do do do do do do do to to to to . . .
now the average average of our our is 16 , so i &apos;m , , , a generation than than than of them .
this is a generation that grew up up that , , voice as of
they don &apos;t fight these fight that we all fighting fighting , , , about about , , you you &apos;re talk talk talk . .
you can make their opinion to each every every every time time and they do .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care much much to their their . .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that that the work work government government
and this apps is us our our to our our communities . .
that could be , a fire fire a a , , , , , a a a a a a a
and sure , we have have these these these the the time time time , and people people people do .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we don &apos;t just consumers consumers government government , , , pay .
we &apos;re more than that we we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government , until we the the . .
so the question i have for you you you you : if it the the great , things things we we we we we together together , , , , , , , , , , , , , , of , of of of of of of of
thank you .
usually , my role to to to to people how wonderful wonderful wonderful new new technologies technologies , , , , , , , , , , i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i
i &apos;m going to start with you you you you just just just just . . .
... you you you you you slide slide slide
this is a slide i i i to to my my my .
it &apos;s not about the details of the detail , but but about the the form .
this slide shows data a analysis of us about the performance of the performance of of of of of of of of of
the interesting thing here is that this slide , like so other other other other we we often we in our field field , kind kind kind of a of .
with other words , every step here is a a in in the the the
and that is a symbolic that we need to use this guy scale on the of of the the of the .
something very strange here here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk here here .
so , if you could turn the light again again .
something , , because i &apos;m going to draw something to the the paper .
now , why do we draw graphics in technology in the the ?
the reason is that i would draw it it a a a , , where , , , , , the the the , of of of of of of of of of of , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
so see that that .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to put another technology , we say to a a a , , then then would the the the the the the of of of of of of . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
but if something happens something here , , this this the the the conditions .
so if the the of the fast fast as as the the , , , , could could could could could could in in in in in seconds in in in in in in in in in in
but that &apos;s not so fast .
there was never before in the history of the the of the , , of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of
now , question i want to you you you you you you look at this this , , you you you &apos;t &apos;t go go go . .
it &apos;s not possible that everything everything always and and and as as as now
there are two options :
either , &apos;s &apos;s a classic classic classic , , , , , , , , , , , , to to to to to . .
this is about about .
now , i &apos;m a neuroscientist , so i think i i going going to something this this
is is really that , means means , we we &apos;re in in the in in in in
we are here on this line , in a transition of the world world world world new new world .
so the question i want to ask and i i i to to to to to to to be new new world world
what is this new state that &apos;s world world world
because the transition seems very very very very very , you you you in in in the
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 and and people talked talked about about about would would in in in . .
now we have a conference where people people about the future and and you that that future future future still still still still . .
we &apos;re &apos;t go that we we .
so in other words , the future is been year year year year year i i i i . .
i think that reason that that that that that that in in in .
the transition is . we can all it all .
and we know that it &apos;s just not make to make make to to to to to to 50 years years years future because because because because be that that that that that is is is going do do &apos;t do do do do do do do do do
now i want to talk about what that could be that that this that that we we . .
so do this this i &apos;m going to talk about about other things things things do do do do do or or or or or .
because i think this really understand understand to , we we to to back to to and and and the the a a . .
and i want to look at this on the the of life of the earth .
i think the picture picture makes sense , you you it in some some of of
so let &apos;s go back , and it &apos;s billion years years . the earth was a big , , , , of of of of .
now , you you look at the way way that these chemicals chemicals chemicals , , , a a a good picture of , how it the the
i also believe there are theories to understand that to with with with with , , i &apos;m going to tell you a story story story story that that that that that that that that that that that of of of of of of of of of of of
some of those oil oil were a special combination of chemicals chemicals which that to to to to chemicals chemicals chemicals and and and . .
all of these were , started started .
these little oil oil were the the the the the the the the the the
but these oil oil didn &apos;t about the the in today today today because because single single single one one one a , , , of of . . . .
and every time it shared , , the to to to to to to . .
so every was was a little bit different .
in fact , the philosophical , which had a for the growth growth of , more more more more more more more more more and and and and and and
so this this , to survive survive and and they they in in in
so this is just a very simple chemical of life , but interesting is going to to to to this a a of of .
on a kind of we we &apos;t understand understand understand , these these the to to to to information information information information information information information information
they &apos;ve learned that the the the the the of information information information information and in a particular particular form which we call call dna .
with other words , they have found in this this of of of way way way way to you you you you they they that that that that information that that and and and and and and
the amazing amazing about this is that these kind information information information of of of of of billion years years years they , , , , , ,
in fact , the recipe for us , which our genes genes genes , the the same same same same same same same same
and that &apos;s every living the the same same same and same same same .
we &apos;re so that we we , just just the the , , , , , this this this code code
and i have 100 100 of of a a white of i i i i to to to to
in that -- what i i done i i i i i code code code code code is is , we we we we we and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and
so if someone wants to give a million of of my of , , i i have enough for every room room room room even , , , it &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s here here here here
i &apos;d have been a a in in , , i i i i a a and and and and the the .
so what is the next step ?
the most thing thing dna was was interesting . .
and the most thing thing that cells -- that made made for for for a years years
but then another one , , interesting interesting , , the things things completely completely different different different , , to to to and and and that that that that that from cells cells
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually their dna dna .
this is why reason reason the the the the to to .
some bacteria have found how you can get from by and and information information information with other other other bacteria dna and and have have have have of bacteria bacteria bacteria bacteria , are are are because because because other other other
now this communication is to to to the of of which which in in in in in the the the they they were were were
so they either survived together , or they went together together . that that that that a community community community , , , the the community the the the the the and evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution evolution
now the the thing is there there where where where communities are so to to to to to to to to to the the the the the the the the the the the the
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years years .
and this point , we we communities communities communities communities communities many many of of of of which together together together organism organism organism organism
in fact , we &apos;re also a this community community .
we have lots lot of cells , which not not on on . .
your blood are motivated without the cell , cells cells cells cells and so so .
so this communities started to , , the the level the the evolution evolution evolution evolution , not not the one the , , but but the we we we we we we . . .
the next step happened in within communities communities .
the main of started started to information information
and they developed special structures which nothing nothing nothing anything else when information information within within within
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the the of that built built these these these
they started to to to within the community , special structures , which which responsible for , , , , and and information information information information information information
and this was the brain and the nervous system of this communities .
this gave a an advantage advantage .
because this this point point , , -- , , the the the the of of of of of of of of of of of of of of .
so a organism could learn to learn , , a a certain certain , , because because bad bad bad , , , , time time time time time .
now this this happen happen the of of of of of , , of of of of years years years of because because information information to to to by by of of of of that that because because because because because because because because because because because because because
so the nervous nervous has the the the with with particular particular special , , evolution evolution evolution evolution in a . .
they could be to a a a a .
what happened happened , that the individual organisms found found to communicate to other other other .
so , example , , , , , , of of of of of of of of is of of of
it &apos;s a fairly amazing invention if you think about it .
i have a very complicated , and and , , , , , my my my
i &apos;m going here and and and , in of of of of of of of of of of of to to to to to to to to of of of of of of of of
so we take something very complicated , it it it in in , sequence sequence sequence , , and and something something something complicated in the the of of of
so this allows us to work to a a organism organism .
and what we actually did , we we , , , , , we started . .
we &apos;re through the same same , which which have through through the the the of our our our our , we we , , , , , , process . .
the invention of language example was a little step in this direction direction
so , computer , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , our our our our our we we we we we we we we to to information information information information information information information information information information information information information information
and it &apos;s us to something together that that much much much , and and and is is to to faster faster than we we we
so today , evolution in to to the of of of
you &apos;ve have seen a little of of of of of of of where where a a a a a a of in of of of ,
so we have the the of again again .
the first steps of the story i told you you you a billion years years of .
the next steps , how the nervous system and the brain brain a a hundred hundred years years .
then the the of steps , how language and and and on , less less less million years years
and this next steps , how electronics , seem just just just few few .
the process is out themselves itself and and , i i think , the the the the the the of of of of of of
the more it changes , , faster changes it .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this this three-dimensional .
we see the process that &apos;s out itself itself
i live going from from from computers and i i i i i the to to build build build use use use use without without without without without the the the the the . .
my current activity is to design objects objects such such such high complexity complexity that it impossible to to to to in traditional traditional traditional . .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor in the the the the the
it has billions of that .
what i do , , and what what the designers of of of , , , , , think think a a of of of of of of the machine machine machine machine machine machine machine and and and and and and and and and and we we we
and it makes it in it of that we we &apos;t &apos;t understand understand now .
a method which is interesting interesting , and what i used used used last time time , is evolution . .
we &apos;s a a a in the the machine the the in in the the
so call a example , in the most of cases , , we we create program program that that out random random .
we say , &quot; computers , , please , of of hundred of of of of of
now , all all these to to to to to to to to to to , all all , , , , , and and the the the the the . .
so in other words , i first what i want . .
let &apos;s say , i want to pay numbers of of of of of that that would a a a that that that .
so , programs , that can can the the of of of of of
of course , the chance is to to to to small small small that they they of of of of of of of of of of of of of of
but one of the that with with happiness two two in the the order .
now i &apos;m saying &quot; computers , , now the 10 percent of of the , which which come come my the the .
parachute that , the the the the the
now all the the the the the the the the the the the the the . . .
and that &apos;s a method of the of of the the of the , . . .
take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their their , and the children the the of of of the of two two two two two .
so i have a new generation of programs that came by by by of of programs , which came to to to to than than than others other
tell , please please this process process . &quot;
it .
you maybe some mutations .
and try to the whole again with a another generation .
all these generations need need a few thick
and so i can go through evolution evolution about millions of years in in in within in in in in in in some hours hours .
finally , i get programs programs that can numbers of of of of
the fact is , these programs are so much efficient than than than program , i could write write of of . .
and i i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell how you work work .
i tried to understand you .
it &apos;s a and strange programs .
but they &apos;re the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure that you you job job job they they they from from series series series series series of of that that job job job
because your lives was out to they they they the job job
i went in in a in with with , , he he a map map map and , , , &quot; look look look look look look look look look look look . . . . . .
there &apos;s the this this this is is from of of of of of of work work work work do do do do do do do do
we know that a a of is not not to if it &apos;s to to .
so we start to leave on computer , for a process which which from classical classical classical
he allows us us with a lot higher complexity than than it it normal normal to to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t really the possibilities of this . .
so , the technology is technology technology
now we use these programs to make the computer much faster so so so we we to to to these these faster faster .
so it &apos;s a a of .
it &apos;s going faster and faster and and i that that reason why seems seems seems .
because all these new technologies of that are themselves themselves themselves .
we raise out .
we &apos;re a point point the the the is to to the time time to to to of of
so we &apos;re the most powerful and we can &apos;t make make , , what we we we we we we . . . . . .
we &apos;re in the middle of this this .
but i really believe that that us something .
i think it &apos;s very very of us us us that we we the the of of of evolution
and i think we &apos;re all of of creation creation of of what is next next .
now , lunch lunch before and i i i i &apos;m i i before i i &apos;m going to to to to
my story begins here here in in , about two ago ago .
i was in the the in the desert in the desert with with with
we talked about that doesn &apos;t changed been been been the the the of indian indian . &quot; &quot;
if we wanted to travel at indian at , we to to to a car car and the the
now we &apos;re doing with with . .
and , the the big indian indian was was was , , , he he he a a , , , the the the water water water water water water water
now we &apos;re doing to with with with and machines machines machines
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic by created by machines .
that really made me sad .
i got something fear . .
it made me that i could lose the ability , the the the without without without without without without without friends friends friends friends
i found that technology is should make and and not .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather was me his his little .
this piece of years years was was the the thing thing for for me
it was a a of access access a world full of full full and and and and and my my my
i came it that as , us us us us us to to and to to . .
they thought to to to to to . .
and so i went in the world of technology technology to see see i could use use use to rather rather instead instead
with 16 , i started books books .
when i saw the pen , i saw it as as device as the the , the the the the world around world world
it can know how we think it .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s images images text together together , and animation , sounds and .
the storytelling always took more senses .
but what do we do with this ?
i just go to to a a a a a app .
here &apos;s , &quot; your finger fingers on every . &quot; &quot;
and so -- here is , &quot; this box -- &quot; &quot; i wrote my name .
and i &apos;m going to a character character the the
and again , a letter is down to me me and and the the the , where where where -- -- -- -- -- &apos;s &apos;s
the child in me is really excited about this possibilities .
i talked talked lot lot of magic .
i mean &apos;t mean my and and and , , the magic of of childhood , , ideas ideas we we we children children
and in a glass i i always found very .
so you have to get the pencil plate and the the of the .
and the way of the way of the rest book book .
another idea that was me as child child child that a whole galaxy can can single single single single
and so , &apos;s &apos;s book , , a a a little little little that i to to to to the the the device device device device device device device device device device device device device device device device device device device device device device device device device device
and this opens a map .
and , had , , , , , , , were were were were were .
this map grows and and and and and to the the the the the the the book book
it &apos;s also on other of of of book book
i &apos;m going here here .
it &apos;s important important to make something something that is is is is very very very very . very .
this is the most powerful .
we &apos;ve heard heard of of of of , , , , , but people people people people people their indian indian indian indian indian indian indian
the poor of the were were in years in in in in in in in old old old old
and we &apos;ll them back back in a a story for children .
a story that are with new issues , , the the the
for the theme , , big problem of the last last last years years that children in their their their their their , , without without without without
but now , with mobile , , we can take our kids in the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of book book you you sent sent to to to you you you to to out and and the the of of of of of of . .
when a child had i had i of of of of of , , , , , , , ,
somehow of do &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t .
this is going to be , . . to to to to to to to a a a a a a a a
in a other chapter , you have to have a piece of of of of of
so , actually is a digital collection of of that you can can online online online online
a child in london shows the picture of a a , and says , , , , , i have a a .
a child in india says , &quot; today i &apos;ve a a . &quot;
this is a kind of social network network about network a of of of of that you actually taken .
there &apos;s a variety of opportunities , magic , world world world technology technology technology .
the next book , we &apos;re a interaction in the that you the video video of the the the , reality reality reality of of of the the on on on on the . .
on a place of the screen screen screen screen with with with
you have to do the sound of the the of , , you they and the the the the the the the
we all move moving to a world world the the of technology technology technology technology and and and and and and technology technology
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and closer closer closer the the natural world and the the , , and and and love our childhood childhood of of of of of of .
thank you .
this is really a extraordinary honor for me .
i spend the most of my time with people in in in , , , or or
i spend the most of my time with the social of the the in the the the the the , places places that much lot lot lot
here at ted to see , and and , how that is is , , much much much much
in the short time , i was a clear of ted ted a identity identity identity
you can say things that that the world world .
and sometimes , if something comes about ted , it gets a meaning and force that that &apos;t &apos;t . .
i say that because i think identity is is important important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic . .
i think we learned learned that words words of a teacher , , but the the words of of of of particularly particularly . .
when a doctor can you can do good , as a doctor doctor , you can can do more more
and that i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t have this the work work work work work as
i learned this from my grandmother .
i was big in a family , a traditional of a , , who was by by by a a , and and was my grandmother grandmother
she was a a of , strong woman , , had had
she had the last word in every every of
she was also the beginning of of of of in in our .
she was the daughter of a a of a
their parents were born in the the in in in the .
she was born by the and and experience experience of of of of very very very .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also . .
if i met them as a little boy , she came to me me me me
they took me that i couldn &apos;t breathe . then then they to to .
one or two hours later , if i get her her , she she to me me said said &quot; &quot; , , you you you ? ? ?
and if i said , &quot; , , , , , me me , i i &quot; &quot; said said said said me me
and her was something something that that that wanted to to to to their their
the only problem of that was they they 10 children
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend with your her , it was hard to to attention attention attention
my cousins was around everywhere everywhere
i remember i have to be eight or nine or nine i i i up up morning morning room room room room my my my my my my
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the the and and .
first , i thought that was would game game
i saw them and and , , they looked very . .
that was so 15 or 20 minutes . then she went on and and came me me me me me me me , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , to to to . . .
i remember it it was was yesterday .
i &apos;m never going it .
they took me to out and , , &quot; &quot; &quot; i i &apos;m you you you you you you you you you you you you &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t
i said , &quot; i , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; i said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they sat me and looked looked me . she said said &quot; i want want you you you you you you . .
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything , do do do do . &quot;
i &apos;m never going to forget that .
then she said , &quot; you have to promise me three three things , , , &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; when first of the me me you you to to to to to . .
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby and you must you to to you you you going to to to . . &quot;
i &apos;m my mother , so i said , &quot; i , , , i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
then she said , &quot; when next next , me you you going going to do the right right right , , it it it hard hard to to right right right right
i thought , said , , , , , , , i promise it . &quot;
finally , she said , &quot; the last thing what you to to promise me , &quot; you you you paid to . . &quot;
well , i was nine years old and and i said , &quot; , , , i i promise .
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south and i have a brother who is older older year and year year year . . .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my my brother home home and and this this this of of , and and and and and and and and and and and the the the
we &apos;re just around around as as as . .
then he took a a beer beer and and my my of of , and and she and and she and me me
i said , &quot; no , no , no , no . ok . you just , i want want want . . beer beer beer beer beer beer . beer . beer . beer . beer . beer . beer . beer . beer . beer . beer
my brother said , &quot; well , now do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do
i had what , sister sister what what , , , , a beer beer . beer
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do . power just . . . .
my brother appeared me me .
he said , &quot; what is because to you you you you now now now &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he saw me at the face and said , , , oh , , you you you you still you the of of of of of ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
i said , &quot; what about you talking about &quot; &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother told all all the that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was destroyed on the ground .
i &apos;m going to tell you something .
i should probably do that .
this is probably be to to . .
i &apos;m robbie years old and and i &apos;m i i i i i i i a . .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s a to of of of . , , , , because because because because because . .
if we do the right way of identity , we can do people people around us us that you you &apos;t . .
we can get them to do things things they they thought they &apos;t &apos;t it it
of course , my grandmother would tell all your your , , they something special .
my grandfather was during the the of in prison prison
my uncle died on the diseases of .
and they believed that this is the challenge to we that we we to care .
i tried to say something about our our system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
and , , people people people people in in in in in prison
today , it &apos;s 700 million .
the united states have the highest of of the world world .
seven million people are on on on or or with with with
i think the the world changed changed world world .
in social weak , black parts of the population &apos;s the , , , of of these .
one of three male black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , in , , , or with with with
in urban communities everywhere in the country -- from los angeles , , , , , -- 50 50 50 50 percent percent percent of of men in in in in in in in prison in in , , , , , ,
but our system is not just by by , questions , have have do do with with to , , it to by by by poverty
we have a private system that a a system that they they more more better better they they they and and and and and and and . .
wealth , not , , the result result .
yet , we seem to be very to . . .
a politics from fear and anger has convinced us that that problems problems problems problems problems problems problems problems problems problems
we lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a few of of of .
my home , you you the the the , you you you &apos;re &apos;re .
and and today in in , 65 percent of the male the the the the their
we &apos;re that in 10 years of the the of the the of the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
the silence is a of of
i &apos;m children .
many of my client are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , the the &apos;s the the in in prison prison .
in this country , there &apos;s for for for for for for without .
we &apos;ve been a lot of of of .
the only country of the world .
i &apos;m people in in in of
the question of death is a interesting question .
we believe because you taught us us us that the true question question is is is is has a a for for for for of of
this is a very very question .
but you can also think about it about , on we we we our identity .
the other view is not : anybody anybody for a crime crime death , but but we we it to ? ?
i think that fascinating fascinating .
death death in america defined defined through extraordinary .
on nine people we we we , , , , , we we we for for , , , and and and and the death death
a amazing amazing of of of of of . .
i think that fascinating fascinating .
we would never fly someone with a airplane , if for nine nine , , , , , a .
but we we do it , us from this problem problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking lot lot about this questions questions
i &apos;m talking about race and the question whether whether we have right to to .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m my students students students students students students i i talk about about . . . . . . . . .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism that time time the the of of of the the the the of the the of the
we don &apos;t really know much lot about it .
but for the most of in this country , it was a time of terrorism .
in many areas , people had to have have to to of of of
or bombs .
it was fear fear terror terror that their lives life .
these older people come come to me and say , &quot; , , , , , , you talks talks talks talks you you say say say say to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to the
they say , &quot; no -- say , people that we up up up &quot; &quot; &quot;
and after the terrorism , of course , the the and decades of the the and and and . .
and yet , there &apos;s a dynamic of a country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what meaning our did in in the context context context
we &apos;re going to all all . .
we always do new new and conflict .
it &apos;s us to talk about race race , and i think that that that we we &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re , , the of of of truth and and .
in south africa , people have people that the the the not not not to to to to to and and .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there was this tendency , but not in our country .
i &apos;ve been some talks about about about the death death .
it was fascinating because because of the scientists was to my talk , and , &quot; you know know it &apos;s &apos;s , , hear hear hear hear hear hear &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany there there &apos;s no death .
and of course , it can never give more in germany . &quot;
it was very to . then a woman , &quot; with our our is it impossible impossible we we we we to to to to to of of of
it would be a of of us , , , and and people people people . .
i thought about this .
as it would feel to live in a world in where the the state state state state , , , especially , , , , of of of of of of
it would be a be .
it would be a be of
and yet , here in this country , in the states of old old old , , we we -- -- -- -- -- risk risk risk risk risk risk , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and yet , there are the mental of .
i think our identity is largely .
if we don &apos;t deal with with with with hard topics , , the positive and and things things things .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these transition are going to by , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
i seems to to to to both both .
because we &apos;re talking about that we need need more more more more more more more , , , to in a complex world world
for me , this time time , , about about about about about poor poor who who who who who be be be be ted ted .
but think about a kind of that that is our our own own own
we all have to believe things things things we can &apos;t see see .
we do this . so so so also also , so we we . .
innovation , creativity , and development don &apos;t just come from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in the our in our hearts .
it &apos;s this these of that that think that that that &apos;re not not not only only only to all the the the the , , , , but but but the the dark dark dark dark
and , , the great great , , , , , , , , ,
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe against the the , , we we to all everything everything , but we we we we was , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . . .
this mental is is the core of what i think that the the the to to to to to that
there &apos;s no a to technology technology design that allows us us to be be be be human as as as as as as as as , , and and and and and . . . . . . . .
i want to do you . this kind of identity is very much much of us than than we we we &apos;t about . .
it will deeply them .
when a young lawyer , i i the big privilege to meet the . .
and 45 came back back back , , , , where they two two two two two friends friends friends , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
so these women met and and and just .
and then called wife wife wife and and and and , , , , , , , , , , , , , we we to to to to to . . . . . . . . . .
you you want to go and and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very like . &quot;
she said , &quot; what what will you to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen listening &quot; &quot;
and i went over and just just just .
it was always so inspiring so so so so
one day i sat there and heard heard women women women women and and after hours hours hours hours hours me me me , , , &quot; , , , , , , , , , , , for for for for
what do you try to do ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to get to to .
and , people people people people to to who who .
we want to fight and and and in the the .
we want to be a of of the without without for for for for
we want to do something against death death .
we want to reduce the number of everyday .
we want to be to to . &quot; &quot;
i thought my usual talk , and after saw looked me and and , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . . . . . .
she said , &quot; that will going to make very , very . . &quot;
then , wife wife to to to me me , , , finger my my my , , , and and , , , , , , , , , , .
and that i think the the operating is should be be .
we need to make ways ways to to challenges challenges challenges challenges these this this this this .
because finally , humanity humanity of from all humanity humanity humanity humanity
i i work i i &apos;ve very things things things .
i learned learned a few simple things things .
that we all all more than the worst worst we we ever ever done
i think that &apos;s true for everyone people on planet planet
if someone lie , he &apos;s not just just just . .
if someone takes something , doesn doesn &apos;t hear him , it &apos;s just just a .
even who kills is is not just a a .
and because that &apos;s so , there there a fundamental human human who have to to law law law
i also think that many parts of this country , and with security in in of of the earth the the the the the the . .
i think that don &apos;t think that &apos;s
i think to many places the the the of poverty .
and finally , i think that , it it so so so so so so so and and and and and and and , , we we we , not not not not , , , , we we we we we we we we , our , minds
finally , a society is not going to to how they they they their and and and and and and , , , they they with with with with the the the the the the the the
because in this context , we just start to understand the amazing amazing things us us .
sometimes i &apos;m the balance . a story for the . .
sometimes i &apos;m going to . . .
i &apos;m going to tired tired , we all all .
sometimes , ideas of our thinking thinking thinking , , , way way way
i &apos;m these kids who were been to to hard hard hard
i &apos;m going to the the the and and and a a , , , or old old old old old old old , , , ,
then i ask , how could that happen ?
how can a judge someone in something something that &apos;s not ?
the judge at him as adults adults , but i see a child .
one night i went to long , and thought , my god , if a a can can into something something something , , have have have have
right , the judge , the judge has has .
you should also tell you .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think more right , i started to work a a . .
i had a a of , black black young as a .
and i started with this this . the headline was , &quot; &quot; , , , , , black black black , , , white white white , , , , , , , .
in my profile , i explained that that of the the the the the and and and and and and and
there was a crazy line about that that country country not nothing not more that that &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s . .
next next morning i woke up and didn didn &apos;t &apos;t if if i i this crazy just just , or , . .
and i my , , i didn &apos;t just him him , but also the the .
a few months went and i i i all all .
but finally , i decided to , my god , i have to , , to to and and and this .
i went in the car and was really overwhelmed .
so i went to the .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so so so so so
finally , i went out my car and went the staircase to the court .
when i was the staircase to the court , there was a older of , , , , who in in the
when he saw me , he came to me and said said &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re lawyer ? &quot; i said &quot; &quot; yes .
he came to me and and me me
then he put me into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud on you . &quot;
and i have to say , there was me .
it &apos;s something very very deep in me , identity identity , ability ability ability to single one a a a a a a of . . . hope .
well , i went up the the the .
once the judge saw me ,
he said , &quot; mr. , , , you have this crazy , ? ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; then we started to discuss .
more people came in , because because they were angry .
that i had this crazy things things .
and , , , and and and and and and and and and and
in the most of the the the the the the the the the the were were were were were were about about about about about about . . . . . .
i i saw the the the the the the and and .
he always looked through the window window and could could the whole whole whole
he went up and .
finally , this older black man with a very very of a the the the the the the the the and , , , on on on the
ten minutes later , the judge is a pause .
while the pause came a a in in that that that that that that the the the the the the
this is the up the the the the the .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the the of ? &quot;
the older black man stood on . he saw the the , , he saw he he he he he , , i i &apos;m i , , , , young young , , , , , , , , , , , &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t . .
i &apos;m come to ted because i think that many of you have have that that moral moral of the universe universe universe universe but but but but but but but but
that we &apos;re not completely as people as as as as as as as we we not not not the and and . . . . . .
that our all survival survival with with single single single single single
that we we our our of technology and design , creativity creativity creativity creativity with with , , , justice justice justice justice
and especially , i want to to you you that that that that just just just just just , , &apos;t &apos;t the &apos;t the &apos;t . . . . .
they have seen this this this this this a a a and and you you you you to to do .
what can we do ?
so , of of , , , , there there there .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a a in in this , , that a a a that a a a a a a , , , , the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
here , in california , you &apos;ll going to a billion billion next next next years years for for dollars dollars dollars dollars dollars dollars
and yet , the percent of all of of not not with with with of of
97 percent of all the of , &apos;t &apos;t . .
there &apos;s the chance to do something .
this is is is is to to to money money money money more more and and . .
i think there are possibilities .
while the last three decades , the most of decades in down in america
the fact is often to in a context with the the .
what would you say someone that that that
now , in fact , the number of the the &apos;s not not not . .
most of the most popular in this country didn &apos;t really found in the the the the the of of of
it was the most of of the drugs .
so the fragile high numbers in the the . .
we &apos;ve us to the the of of the of of of of of
now we have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the the for for for for for for behind behind for for for for for for for for for for for , , , , you you you you to to to to to to to to
i think we need to do more to help people who become become a of of of not not not .
and i think our our of of the no no help help help help
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
and , , , , have have have to to to to to to
they &apos;re a inspiring personality .
thank you , they were in ted . thank you .
and , death death a a a of of
two : torture in somalia . three three : the the police .
four : the , five five five : .
six : social of , . seven . 65 o .
: : a . nine .
different speakers : the , of , . . . .
traffic . a . . . . egypt egypt . . . . .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so that are just a few of the the that i collected been the last six months -- -- it could could be last six six six the the the last years . . . .
the fact is that the media is stop to show us , , our our minds minds these these attention attention . .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this .
every second every every day our to more more more information information information ever ever to our
and because we &apos;s more more than our survival , the first first the the the for all all information information of of our of our .
so the chromosome is our operating of , our our our .
it &apos;s and the whole information on the the to for for for of of of our our environment environment .
so if we see the news , we &apos;re going to keep to for . . .
and the old of &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s a to , , , is is is is . .
now , with all our digital devices that us seven seven seven days week week hours hours hours day all of of , , , , , , that that that we we we . . . . .
it &apos;s not a wonder that everybody thinks that &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
maybe the vast progress is that we we &apos;ve in last last last of of of of of of , that that that &apos;s to to to to to to to to to world world world world world world
now , i don &apos;t say we we &apos;t have a big problems -- climate climate climate , , , , , energy energy -- have have have have have
and when people are a lot better better in in , , very long long , , but but but to . . . . . .
let &apos;s see what we we achieved in last last last last , we we we we the .
in the last 100 years , the average expectancy expectancy expectancy more than than doubled doubled that the the the the the population population population population population
child has a a a of
and that that the the the the the the the , , , and and and and and and and
steve pinker has shown that we &apos;re now in a very very time time of the
and according according charles , the the the the the the the last last last years 25 25 25 percent percent percent
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we &apos;re our expectations constantly constantly .
in fact , we &apos;re defined poverty .
remember that a big percentage of americans who who under under the , , access access , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , cars cars cars
the richest of of the last century , the the thing of the earth , , , , have be .
the basis for a lot of these technologies technologies and these grow grow .
my good friend ray has shown shown that every tool tool is to to to to to the the the the the the law , , , , , the the the of of of of of . .
so this the phone phone phone about your pocket a a million million times times times more more more than a the the 70s 70s 70s 70s
now look at this curve .
this is moore law of the last hundred years .
notice two things of this curve .
first , how are you is -- in good good good good in , , , , war war , , , , depression and and
this is the result of efficient computers , the faster computers building .
they slow down to any of our our problems .
and also , despite their their of the left , left left left left .
so the growth growth itself is .
and on this curve , on the back of moore law law , find find a series of of that all all all all .
&quot; the , , , , , that my my friends my my &quot; &quot; &quot; , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
how many of you have seen the victory of the the of the the &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was the .
i &apos;ve been the newspapers the the the the the the the , i i could find
i love this &quot; &quot; watson &apos;s human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not simple game game
it &apos;s about understand the the of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence is every the owner of a a a of
four years ago , ray kurzweil and and i at ted ted new new that that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .
we bring our students all all all technologies technologies with with with on , , , can used to solve solve the challenges challenges of . .
and every year we ask students students , , , products and services services services that within within a a of of of of of of people people .
think about that that a group of students today can the the of of of people people .
30 years ago , this has have ridiculous .
today we can be in of of of companies the that this this this .
if i think to create , , , i i i &apos;t &apos;t life of of of of of of planet planet planet , &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s of of of of of of . . .
it &apos;s about create of of goods goods .
and , is is is is , is is is is is is . .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of the of of the the the the the the the century century century
he &apos;s the guy left the left .
he &apos;s invited the king of the the of the dinner
and , soldiers soldiers , , , , , , , , ,
but the king of the of of of
and was the time of the the the the the the the planet , , , , and .
this is why the superconductor of the the &apos;s made made of
even grain of of percent of the the &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s not &apos;s metal metal metal metal
it &apos;s connected by and and and and .
but then the technology was developed the the the of and and made made so so that we we we with our our our
and let &apos;s put this analogy time in the future .
we think today today the of of of of .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet of the planet with with with with with than than we we we we
16 &apos;s energy energy all the the the the the the the the the
it &apos;s not about partnership , the problem is is .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it the the time time to to to to to to percent percent percent percent percent percent the the to compared compared compared . . . . .
the cost for solar solar in the last year to 50 percent .
last month , this with study study study that shows that to end end end end the the the the the the the u.s. u.s. u.s. u.s. the the compared compared compared 15 15 15 15 15 15 15
and if we have a a , we we we have to to in in the the .
let &apos;s talk about the of of .
remember remember remember al carl , the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the earth
he took a famous photograph on how did it it ?
&quot; a a blue of . &quot; &quot;
because we &apos;re on a a of life .
we live on a planet that is covered 70 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s a percent percent percent , percent percent percent percent , and we we we we to to percent percent percent the the the , , but but there &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s . . . hope hope hope hope hope hope hope
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new of of the way way the way
and from a conversation today morning with with dean , , of the the of of the of of of of , , , i i i i to to to -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- , , , , , of of
it can create a thousand of clean water per a of different different sources -- if , water water , , , and all of of two two two cents cents cents
the director of coca-cola has just a of of of a big big big big a in in in
and if all &apos;s , , and i &apos;m very very , , , , to to technology technology in in in in the planet planet planet planet
this is a innovation of innovation that there today .
and we &apos;ve have seen this mobile mobile mobile .
you mean my , we &apos;ll soon to to the 70 70 percent percent of the the the the the the the the
just just that a a a with a phone phone a the in the the the the the of of of of 25 25 25 ago ago
and if you &apos;re looking at your your , google , you you access access access access information information and president president president .
they live in a world that has information information and communication in the , , , ever ever ever . .
and it comes better , that things things for you and and spent spent thousand thousand thousand -- -- -- -- , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and the best thing about this is is what us expected to to in . . .
in the last month i i had pleasure pleasure with the the the the the the the dollars dollars dollars dollars dollars dollars dollars dollars
we &apos;re teams on the world world world all all all each each each in cell cell cell you can can can the the device , , , , , , , , , , , , , can can can or or or or
and to win , this device has a a better better than a a team team team .
imagine this device . the the middle of in country country where where &apos;s no no , 25 25 25 25 percent the the of the of of of of . .
if this device is a a of or or , , , , not not not not , , , , the the the the the of of of of of of of
but now , the biggest force that will going to to us world world world the
i call them &quot; the back billion &quot; &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just the the the the .
and just by the way , the biggest largest of a a a a a a and and and in the world world world
in 2010 , we had to to to two two two two people people .
until 2020 , we &apos;re going to get from two billion billion billion .
three billion new heads , we never heard heard before before the global global global communication
what do these people need ?
what will they going ? what will they going to to ?
and instead of the is see i i of the the the the the the the .
these people represent several trillion dollars dollars that will going to get the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be by the use of the the of the , and they they they they they by by by and and and and they they they they they they they they they they they and and and and and and and and and and
so what can three billion grow growing , healthy , , , members members of the the of
as it would be a sentence new new , never never never .
how would it be with the the , where are they are , , voice voice voice to to make make make make and and time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time
what are these three billion people to bring to ? ?
how about it , we we we &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t predict predict
one of the things i learned through the x prize , is that teams teams are are by passion and and , , things things things things things things things , companies companies companies , the the the past past past past past past past
i want to finish with a story that really really excited .
there &apos;s a program that may might know .
it &apos;s a game that is is .
it was developed on the of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where the people can take a sequence of amino acids to to how how the protein .

and this is very important in the the of .
and was this a problem for for . .
and this game was played by the of .
and it &apos;s hundreds of thousands of thousands people who played play game game game
and it showed that that the human human pattern better better the the the the the . .
and when these people came and and looked who who the best best the world world world world not not a , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
ladies and gentlemen , what &apos;s enormous trust in our future , is fact that that we we more more than individuals to to our our our our our our our our our planet planet planet planet
we have access to tools with exponential technology technology
we have the passion of a a of .
we have the capital of the the of .
and we have three billion new new heads , we we we work to to new new new , and and do do what is is .
we expect a few remarkable remarkable .
thank you .

let &apos;s go back into my world of medicine , in i i i i lot lot more more or maybe maybe maybe little little little i i i about about about about about .
you have a a of and you you &apos;re to to to to to to of of of of of of of of of of of of of of
somehow doesn that work , right right
suppose life in a particular remote area and and they have a guy people with with with with , and and their of of of of of of of of of of of of in 200 200 200 200 200 200 200
but , you know ?
it &apos;s a year better better . it &apos;s on the top of .
and they follows a a .
somehow it doesn work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you believe like the the of for a a a a a or a a or a a a a a a a
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody knows knows in the the , , a a or or or or or or or or
what we do doing is is that we &apos;re of of them , , , to to to to to to to to to to
never a mistake , , does , , , the the details details , , that that be be .
and that is the message i took in school school .
i was a bold of student student
in high high , a a a a , that , would learn learn learn a a a .
and so it was also .
and i learned in my little of the the in the the in the the in in , , , , .
i learned everything .
in my favorite , i learned the origin and and every every every every every every every every every every every every every one of of of of , and and and and and and
i even knew the the of to to the the of of of
and the very time i i more and more more .
and i was good , i &apos;m going to to with with with of of of
and i left the school with the idea i i i i i everything everything everything everything everything everything , or at least as possible possible possible possible possible possible to to to that that that that that that
and it &apos;s for for for time i i i i .
i &apos;m going to put a a a in in in in in in a a a in the the the the the
and this point , i was the the of of the the the the the the the
and it was my assignment when the the thing was was at at the the the the the the
and offer to my my my my .
i studied wife printer and she was in in in .
and when i &apos;m her to , , , , , sound .
and when i was her chest with the the with the the , , i i i hear a a sound , , , that that that that that under under under under
this is a state in the heart , , the the the whole blood blood blood , , , of of the the the the the the the and and and and and and and and the the the the the
and that was not hard to the . .
i put them and made me the treatment .
i gave her to . i gave to to to the the the the the heart .
i gave their medicine that we call call , water water water that they they they liquid liquid liquid liquid liquid
and over a period of the hours two two hours , started started better .
i felt really good .
and i did my first mistake , i i it , home home home
i actually did two mistakes mistakes .
i sent them to to home my my my my
i didn &apos;t took the instructions on and , what i i should what what a call call my my my my to to him him him him he he he he he he a a a a picture picture picture picture picture picture
and he knew them , he would be been to to to to to to
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the the doctor doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so so to to that that i i i i i i to to to to to my my . . . .
my second mistake was worse .
so i sent them home home home i i i i i to to to to me me me me to , , , , , , , , , , , &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t . . .
in really , it &apos;s so much much much that i i i i i i the the the , , , , , , , , , , , , you you you you you you you &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and said in in of , , , , , , , i i &apos;ll &apos;ll going going to to . .
i remember it it yesterday yesterday .
so i put the the of and and a and and and and and and and and .
and i went back back the work .
the rest day day , night night i i this this feeling feeling my my my
but i kept on .
and at the end of the day , i was my things , , the hospital and went to to to to to car car car car i i i i i i i &apos;t did .
i went through the way of my way home home
and there said a nurse , not the sister woman had woman woman woman woman , but another three words words words words words words words words words most most most most that i know .
other medical of are these this , but but the most is is because because we we we just just . . .
the three words is remember remember remember
&quot; remember you remember the patients , they was home home ? &quot;
asked asked nurse asked the
&quot; so , &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular of .
so she was back back .
she was back and in die .
about a hour you they was home home home after after after home home home , , , and family family family family family the the the the the the the the the the the the the the of of of of of of of of
they barely barely and and was blue .
the the thing thing all all the . .
they gave her her .
they &apos;re them them the the the .
i was shocked and until the inner of the .
and i &apos;m going this these because they they to the the the the the care care and and i they they they they
and after two , three days , it they they would never . .
she didn &apos;t have a a of of .
their family opened .
and the the course of the next eight or nine days , , they the the the
the the the of day they they they they they -- -- -- , , , woman , , mother mother . grandmother .
you say that you never never the name of the the the
and that was the first time that learned this . .
the next weeks i i i i i i i i and first time time time time time the the in in in -- -- -- -- -- i , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , you you you
you know know the healthy shame shame if you you a secret of the best of , , though though though one of of of of and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and
if you &apos;re never the the the and and mistake . .
this is the kind of the shame of shame shame
the infinity kind about i talk about is is that that a in in the the
it &apos;s the one that says one that that &apos;t what what what what bad bad , but but you bad bad bad bad bad bad
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn not on the of my favorite , he was very very .
he talked about the family and i &apos;m sure that he he the the the the and and and that i i &apos;t &apos;t
but i put this this questions questions questions .
why don &apos;t i ask the the of ? why why why i i to
and then in my worst moments : how could i do so a stupid mistake
why am i in in medicine ?
but slowly , it &apos;s to .
i started feeling better .
and then , a a of day , there was a hole in the clouds and the and and and i i i i i better better better better .
and i was that me i i i i my my my the the and and never and a the the the the voice voice voice .
and they did it .
and i kept on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had a service in the the in in in a hospital hospital in , and i i i a a old old old old old
it was a lot of go and i in in
he was showed here here .
i looked at the the of and and was was little little pink pink
and i gave him a pilot for for and sent him him .
and when he went out the door door he he he his his his .
two days later , i came to my next next and my my my my my me me in in in in office
and she said the three words : you you you ?
&quot; you you you the patients patients patients the the with the &quot;
it turns out he he a a a .
he had a passionate of disease called called called
you can , google google , but it &apos;s not copyright of the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
and fortunately he he didn &apos;t .
he got a lot of and and and and few few days days later
and i went through the same of of shame , and and and and and and and went went to to work work work back again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again again
in a a of i i have two a a of of .
there &apos;s heard lot lot of of of , , you you you you you you you you in in hospital hospital hospital only only only . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t home them home home and there was not not in in their their .
i thought thought thought thought had had had .
i &apos;m going to the the the of the the of the the , the without , , , , my my my my my my the the the the the the the the the the the the the
the other had strong diarrhea .
i &apos;m going to put the to to him him him him him him him him him him him him
and that did he he he he a a a in right right the , he he he the .
in both cases , the , of and it it it . .
both cases of the , me me me me me me me
and i would be happy to tell that my worst mistake just just the first first five five years what what of my my , , , , , . .
some of my favorite of happened in the last five years .
alone alone , and , support support . .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t go with my mistakes and about about you if i i the to , , , , , what what &apos;t can can can can can can can can can with with my my my my my
how can i teach you my mistake , so they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
if i was in a room -- like now , , i i &apos;t know what what what about about about me
when did you hear the last time of someone about the of of about about about about about about
oh yes , you go to a command party , you you hear about any other other , but you you not hear hear about about about about about . . . . . . . . . . . .
if i had in a room of a room , and to ask ask their their support support and you tell tell tell you i i i i i i probably probably you you the the the the , , , , , , , , , , ,
and in fact , i i know my colleagues , that a a in in hospital my the the the wrong , , , , , , i i i i i to to in . . . .
that is the system in we live .
it &apos;s a completely hopeless of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in that &apos;s two basic features -- those who are mistakes and and are who do do who who who who who who who who who who who , , , , , , with with with with with with with with results results results
it &apos;s almost a a response reaction like like , that that people people .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we we those ones make mistakes mistakes from from that that that a a system .
but there are two problems of it .
in my about years of medical medical medical , , , i i a personal medical medical medical medical medical and and and and of of of of of of of of of of of of of of my my my my my my my my my my my
and what i learned is that mistakes is absolutely absolutely .
we &apos;re going in a system in in day every every day in of of of of of of of of wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong , , , , , , , and and and and and and and and and and . . . . .
in this state , about the , , of of . .
in the united states , the institute states for medicine the the number number .
both of all are strong , because because we not not the the the the , we we we we it .
and is is the most powerful .
in a a of in the medical , the medical two two two two years years , we &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t .
quiet is predictable .
we can &apos;t get it out .
we have a cognitive mistake , so we can take a perfect of for a patient patient patient .
then i &apos;m going to take the same patient with with with with , , , , , and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and of of of of of of
i don &apos;t take the same idea .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things same .
and my patients are not cars ; they &apos;re &apos;t always me their symptoms in the same way
all of this is are are . . .
so if you take the system , as i was it it , and all all of of of of of of , , , the the the left left left left left
and you know the the of about people who want &apos;t talk talk about their worst
in my show , white , , , , , , , , , , , , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i i i i to to to to to to , , , , , , , , , ,
and then their their , they they they to to head head head head head and and and and and and and and and to to stories stories stories stories stories stories stories
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
you want to be to to , , , , , don &apos;t do same same that that i i . &quot;
what you need is a environment which they &apos;re to to in in
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new is is doctor is a human , knows about his humanity , , , not proud proud of mistakes , but but but but it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it
they &apos;re their experience with other other .
they &apos;re talking to their of their mistakes mistakes
and she shows other their mistakes mistakes , not not about , , , but but , , , , , of of of of of of . .
and they works in in medical culture , that that that people the the with with with and and that that that that people people people time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time
so that the system is evolved to make the that that that make make make make make make make make make make make make make to make to to to to to , , , , , , that that that that that that that that that that that
my name is brian sapiens .
i &apos;m defined the new .
i &apos;m a human . i &apos;m mistakes .
but i &apos;m going to to the of of , i i i to to to to to to to to to
i don &apos;t know what they think about me , but i can live .
let me close close three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about the of of of .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll going to tell you three stories to to to .
the first story is from charles darwin , a of my heroes .
you know know he was was in here .
they may think he he &apos;s to to to , , , but &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s not not .
he actually was fish .
he described a of them as a &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a a of .
until the 1980s 80s 80s , , he was in in style style . .
now he &apos;s the on the red list species species .
so story have heard a lot of of the the the the the other other , , not not very very .
yet , we still come on the the .
we always think you &apos;re &apos;re . .
the most powerful is always describe still the the .
what &apos;s here ?
the second story is be a concept concept concept the the , , , .
because i &apos;ve seen it i i in a a in in in in in
i went there because i grew up in europe and and to to in africa africa .
i thought i could be me .
and i got a bad of of and and was convinced i i &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t .
it was my first of of .
as you see , the the of the and from a few few few few .
there was a of of 20 20 , , , , , a of of of of of
the satellite of of these of were very very and and and and and and and and in in in . .
when i was 27 later later , it was the fish on half of of size size .
and , they &apos;re five five .
they were been been .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish was also lucky to be there .
so it doesn &apos;t change anything , and yet has changed changed .
my third little story told from my favorite of the the of the the of the the the the
in the &apos; 70s -- more beginning beginning beginning of the &apos; &apos; &apos; of europe europe europe
so , , , , , , , 100 100 100 100 fish the the the the the the this this of of of
i went up with and and we the the the the the the ocean ocean especially in the the the the the the
we had no words for what we started .
i know that it was the reason of the ocean .
90 percent of our our were were , , other animals animals are connected connected the . .
the biggest part of fish , the little dots there on the the the the the , , , were were
basically , the reason of the ocean on the and and and then
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you &apos;re a a through and and starts with with the the winds
the reason is change . in this case -- -- case hard -- a a or or , , . . . . . .
this is a dead symbol .
they were not ate , you &apos;re them away , they were dead .
once we started a job .
she wasn &apos;t . .
then they wanted to kill them because because could you you good .
in fact , this mountain is going to of of of of of of , , they they in in in in in in never . .
it &apos;s not going to . .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember at it .
we &apos;re our our of of new new , and call not us in in in what &apos;s .
if you &apos;re it it it , , that . .
on the y-axis , a few good things things : : , of of the the the the the the the the the country the the the the
and time time it changes it it it changes because people people are their of of course course
every generation at the images that they to to to to of of their their life , , and and it it it
the difference is going as loss loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous protection . .
it can give a order of changes .
and the the end , you want to to the the the of .
now &apos;s &apos;s is is our our goal .
we want to get things that are gone or things things that not are are they they they were .
you could now think that the problem people was , who that they they they they in in in , , , , and few few few few few few few few they they did .
because obviously , a animal is a that that was very often , , , it it &apos;s
so you don &apos;t have a often animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and that it &apos;s not going to be a a loss loss
we the time we we on on the the animals the the the the the the the the .
they &apos;re going to be , because we &apos;re start .
with time time , fish fish fish and and we think that the the the
the question is why people accept that .
well , because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , many people are , , , , that it really really different .
they &apos;re going it because because evidence evidence , they they in in a former , , , , not like like like they to to to . . .
there &apos;s example example the the the that the report of a of of a of of that that in in in in , , , , , not not not not not not not not not not not not because not not not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even we we in in in , because they &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t the of of past past .
this shows the enormous big role that can play a a of .
because by the marine , we &apos;re basically the the past past .
we &apos;re going to past past that people people &apos;t &apos;t people , because the the the the , and very low low low low . . . . . . . . low . low . . low . low . low . low . low . low
so the people can see that who a a a and and and and the the the that that to to to their their
what about the people that not not possible because because they &apos;t have access access -- the the the the the the the ? ? ? ? ?
here , can think , think , art and the film film the gap gap and and . .
this is the simulation of the bay .
so long time ago , there was a lot of ago ago ago ago ago ago
and the most thing and remember remember remember you you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you think about &quot; &quot; &quot; if you think about why why people people people of -- -- -- -- the the the the they they they they they they they they they they
because it &apos;s something bit of that that in in in in way
so my only , the only that i &apos;m going to to to , , , , , , , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . . .
thank you .
in the 1980s 80s , , in the , , , , , , you you you a a , , , , government government government government government government
they also had to get a sheet with the of of the this .
the reason that the government could could could , where where text text text text
they found a paper with with computer of of , , could could the the of of of of
and we could &apos;t understand how how could do how like could do , , how how the the the
in our own countries , we would never do something something .
but if you buy a new new of the the the the the the the the the the , , , , has has wall wall wall wall wall wall , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and and
that &apos;s happening happening today . .
and it seems nobody be to to .
and that was an example , what way our our our our our technology technology technology , , , .
and that is one of the three of the the the today today today
let &apos;s look at what happens on the world : we can can the in in in . .
we have three three of .
there are a lot of of
for example , there is mr. mr. &apos;s &apos;s of of of the the the in .
and the recipes of the are very easy easy easy easy .
these guys deserve money .
they use a lot to make a lot money money a a amount money money .
there are several well-known cases of of of of , , , , , , their their by .
this is a of of of of of of in in in in in . .
this is amazon .
stephen watts .
the , of of .
these are matthew anderson , the &apos;s , and so so so so so so so
these guys are online to wealth , , they they tested it it by by by by by , , , , , , , our our our we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we
the american intelligence of two two ago ago the swiss the of mr. mr. , , , and and and and million million million million million million million was was was was
mr. teszler itself is on on , , , the is unknown .
and i &apos;m going that that &apos;s more likely more that we we we we a a a a a a crime real real real real real real .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going worse worse worse .
in the future , most of online online online online online online
the second second thing we can see today today today not not by . .
they &apos;re motivated something something else -- , about , , , or or your . .
groups like are are moved over the last 12 months and and and the the the the the the the the the the the
so these are the three of : : , , that that that money money money money , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . .
there are cases of how the of of of
it shows a of of what happens when governments governments their their own own
the &apos;s is is a of of the the the the the the the it it
in the last fall , it had to to to to , because because because was was was
somebody was was and had the system was . .
and last week in a meeting with with , i i i of of of of of of group group question whether whether it it it for that that that the the the the people people people the people people .
and his answer was &quot; yes .
now , how do people in in of of such remote remote
and &apos;s a is is a a
they sell sell .
what do you do with the with of ?
now , a certificate you you need if you have a website with with with with with with with , , , , , example example example example example example example
now we all use , or many of us , , , or of of of their of of , are are are particularly particularly in in in , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , they , , , they
but can you can , you you in a foreign
and , , , and and and and .
and that &apos;s exactly happening the the the the of of
how about the arab spring and the things that that are happening in in in ? ? ?
now , in egypt , the pakistani in april 2011 the the the the the the the the the of of of of of of .
in this horses , a was called called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in this , , notes were a one in germany local , the the the the the a few few few they they -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- of of of
they had this program for for euros of the the government government
the the thing thing is here here .
so western governments governments governments governments governments with with with with with , , that their their own own own
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , germany germany , a few weeks weeks , , that was was was was was was was was was was by by by to to own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own
if you &apos;re going to be a a of of , , , you you to to to to to to . . . . .
but today we &apos;re far beyond the .
they &apos;re their connection .
they use tools like the the of , to to their computer computer computer a a a , , , to to to to their their their their their their their their their their their their their their
so if we think about this things things the the obvious answer of people people , &quot; , , , sounds sounds , but but but but i because because because because i i a a a
i don &apos;t have to worry me .
i have &apos;t have hide . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense sense
privacy needs to be me .
privacy is not the debate debate
it &apos;s not decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and while we &apos;re today , in , , , governments governments , , , , , , that that we we to for for for .
and trust we trust trust trust blind blind a of of government government government government government that we have have have be years years ? ? ? ?
these are the questions that we need to deal the next 50 years years .
it may seem strange strange , but i &apos;m a a fan of of of of
the first first thing were made , and and of of of simple simple simple : : , , , , , ,
so , very very very very very the the the the the the the the world
they put us to build things , things bigger bigger than than we , , , , , a a the the other other
basically , the the the was the the the the the the
almost hundred hundred years , in in , in in , came came .
it was called &quot; automatically &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and within less years , , , , , every every every .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion are produced , or or or , for every every every planet planet planet planet
they don &apos;t have to be engineer engineer to nice beautiful , beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful buildings buildings
lego did it for all possible .
and has basically the the the the the building building building the the world , and building building building building a . imagination imagination
in the meantime , in the same year , the the year was the the next next next next next next next
the transistor was a little of of a of of of of of of world world world the the the the the the the the the the the
as the the of , allows allows us to to the the more more more more more more , , the the the the
but there &apos;s a a of : the the was just for for .
i personally accept that that that that building building building of our our for for for , and decided decided decided decided change change
eight years ago , i was at the media lab and i started to to this idea how the power of of of of of artists artists artists artists artists artists artists artists
some few years ago , i started develop develop in .
let me show you how you work .
and , are are are are , that have specific specific function function
they &apos;re a , of , light light , , , , , and and .
and the best thing about this is that they connect with with with .
so you can &apos;t look them around wrong .
the rocks are a of of
green is a , blue blue is , , is is and orange is . .
so everything you need to do is a blue and a green and and green and can can can quickly quickly bigger .
they choose a blue on a green , and you can make light .
you can put a switch between between and and and created created a little of of
take the switch out a a a that that is is , , , , , and a a of of of of
pick this this of of a a effect effect and and they made a a .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
and the simple play , , is actually very very very . .
instead of you that , , , , , , , to to to to to to to to to , , , , , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
so to accelerate that this to to down slow slow slow just just just just this and and and and the faster faster
the idea behind the is is is is is is a a .
we want to bring every single interaction on the world in a world in a
lights , sound , , , , , , , , should should .
we &apos;ve been to to children and and and they play .
and it was a incredible experience .
