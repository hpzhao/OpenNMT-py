you know , one of the great things that travel in the travel and one of the pleasures in the field of research is to live with people who remember the old days . the past still feels the wind , they &apos;re still touching the wind of the plants .
just knowing that the way that the way that the world &apos;s way to travel beyond the milky way is to be the importance of the oldest of the inuit , or that in the himalayas , the buddhist is still the breath of the world &apos;s breath , which is the idea that the world is in the world , which is even successful , but a model of reality , which is a group of certain possibilities of adaptation , which is the idea of a group of certain possibilities of adaptation .
and of course , we all share the same thing .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing kids to the world .
we go through the street .
we need to deal with the inexorable separation of death and so that we shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dance and art .
but interesting is the unique tone of the brain &apos;s brain , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the most important in the forests of borneo , or the warrior in haiti , or the warrior in the world &apos;s office , or the warrior in the middle of the desert , or a more , in the middle of the sahara , which is the mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother , or even a more , a the mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother .
all these people teach us that there are other kinds of things that are different , other ways to think about the way to make a handle on earth .
and that &apos;s a notion that , if you think about it , can only fulfill a hope .
together , the myriad cultures of the world are a net of a network of dna and cultural life that &apos;s the earth , and the world &apos;s most important , as the biological energy system , which is the biological power of the world you know as biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural design system as a computer model , and it can be considered the most important of all thoughts and dreams , myths , myths , inspiration and intuitions that have been generated by the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
the most amazing legacy is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we &apos;re capable of , and what we &apos;re capable of as amazing species .
and as the biosphere was very disconnected , this was happening with the most powerful -- just more than even greater speed .
no biologist would say to say that 50 percent or more of all species are just about extinction , because it &apos;s just not true , and yet , this -- the most important thing that &apos;s known to the field of biological diversity -- is hardly the one that &apos;s known as a computer designer on the cultural diversity .
and the key indicator of this is extinction .
when everybody was born in this room , 6,000 languages were spoken on the earth .
now , a language is not just the full of the vocabulary or a series of plastic types .
a language is expression of human mind .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a particular culture finds access to the material world .
every language is like a forest forest of the mind , a turning point , a thought , a ecosystem , a ecosystem .
and from these 6,000 languages today , while we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , the half of the children are not in the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught to be taught to be the infants , which means that if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely than being the silence of being a silent person who &apos;s talking to your language , who are talking to your language , no way to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or hope to expect children ?
and yet , this terrible destiny is actually someone on earth somewhere on earth , about two weeks , because all two weeks , a elderly dies , and takes the last bit of the old time of an old language with the grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; it &apos;s not better ? &quot; would not be the world , if we all talk a language , if we all talk to a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be a little bit of this language . &quot;
let &apos;s be a kogi . &quot;
and then you would suddenly recognize how it would be , if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so i want to take you in a way to take a trip through the ted process , a short journey through the most powerful , to try to understand what &apos;s actually lost .
now there are some of us who forget that i say , &quot; different possibilities of his being , &quot; really different possibilities of his being .
for example , take this child of the world &apos;s most popular in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the world &apos;s people , believe that they &apos;re going to be the most prolific of the east of saint snakes .
this is a people who don &apos;t distinguish cognitively between the colors and green , because the forest is the forest , the people who depend on the forest , is the people who are dependent on .
they have a strange language , and a more thoughtful language called the linguistic language , you have to marry somebody who talks a different language .
all of this is the most consistent in the mythological past , the strange ones that are spoken in the very large houses , where the most of the time that we have six or seven languages are spoken , but that &apos;s that you &apos;re never listening to somebody who learns a language .
you just hear and start talking .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the most amazing in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people who was first contacted in 1958 .
in 1957 , five commandments were trying to contact and made a mistake of a mistake .
they threw up these shiny photos from the air , which we would be as friendly as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people had never seen anything in their life .
they took these photographs from the forest forest , trying to see behind the face or the character , didn &apos;t find anything and the character , that this business business of the devil was and killing the five commandments with the spear .
but the most important thing was not just killing the spear with the spear .
they &apos;re going to be a different one .
54 percent of deaths happened by the deaths .
we &apos;ve been looking back at eight generations and found two cases of a natural death and when we were doing the people with a fool about it , they gave that one of the people was so old that he died because of his age , and we killed him with the spear .
but at the same time , they had a clear idea of forest , which was amazing .
their hunters could smell the urine of a animal from 40 steps away , and determine what animals of these were .
in the early days , i got a really amazing task when my professor was at harvard , whether i was interested in walking to haiti and to infiltrate the secret societies that were the foundation of the strength of the sun and the poison , which was used to make a difference for making a difference .
to give this sense of a sense of a sense , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of the most remarkable faith and voodoo is not a cult of the black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex kind of metaphysical worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked them , the great world world &apos;s world &apos;s great world , what would they say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , or whatever .
a continent will always leave , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious belief , of course , and there &apos;s just a little bit of the little religious thought that &apos;s been the tragic religious thought of the tragic religious thought .
but what &apos;s interesting is that this is a living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living give the minds .
the minds can be made by the great water , answers to the rhythm of dance to be temporary to the soul of living , so that the most subtle moment for a brief moment is going to be the god .
the most important thing is , the most popular thing to say , &quot; your white is going to church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the mind , you &apos;re going to get off the mind . how can you get damage ?
look at this amazing demonstrations : the most amazing thing in a computer scanner that &apos;s the red coal without combustion , an amazing illustration of the ability to influence the body that this is the body that is going to be the extreme , if he &apos;s going to be able to put it in a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all people i met , the kogi from the sierra nevada de nevada in northern nevada , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the old civil civilization , the caribbean that the caribbean &apos;s caribbean , and in the aftermath of the railroad , was moved to a massive massive , massive back , which is going to be cut over the caribbean in the caribbean .
in a very troubled continent , these people were the only ones that were never conquered by the most cosmopolitan .
until today , you &apos;re going to be led by a ritual priesthood , and the education is very extraordinary .
the young people are separated in age three and four years from their families , and in a world of darkness , in the front of the glacier , for 18 years , to be able to mimic the glacier for 18 months , and two times of the nine years of pregnancy , they &apos;re going to be elected to the lap of the great mother .
and during this whole time , they &apos;re introduced to the values of their society , values that sustain the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
at the end of this amazing , you &apos;ll suddenly be taken out of one day and the first time in your life , in the age of 18 years , you see a sunrise , and in this particular moment of consciousness , the first light is going to be the same thing that you &apos;ve learned in the abstract , and the priest will come back and say , &quot; look , it &apos;s really how i told you . it &apos;s really what i &apos;ve been telling you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now , this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think about native and landscape , we either have a little bit of the old wild and the old wild of the fancy wild , which is a thought of a thought of the thought , or the other thing , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we do .
so , indigenous are neither a sentimental , nor they &apos;re going to be a vegetarian .
it doesn &apos;t remain much space for the most powerful of the world &apos;s life , or the cold winds of tibet , but they still have a mystery of the earth , which is not based on the idea , but it &apos;s a very subtle intuition that the earth can only exist because they &apos;re in the human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child from the andean , which is growing up in the mind that the mountain is a very different , which is a very different person , and a different relationship to this resource , and a different relationship to this resource , and a different relationship to this resource , is that a mountain can be a bunch of rocks that can be worn away .
whether he &apos;s a shocker of a mind or a bunch of sugar , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor , which defined the relationship between the individual and the nature .
i grew up in the woods of british columbia , and i believed that these forests are there to become a more inclusive .
this made me a different person as my friends under the most violent , believing that these forests of the blade of the proton and the curved spirits are the ones that live in the world , minds that are going to live on their own business .
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took only last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is a lot of the people who have heard of the most powerful , the most powerful logic of the repertoire of the body .
what makes the most intriguing thing is not just the potential potential of this kind of thing , but it &apos;s actually made of two different sources of information on the one hand , and there &apos;s a side of the wooden , which is a series of plastic , which is a series of plastic , which is a series of a car , which is a little bit of a light of the family , but it &apos;s a little bit of a light of the family .
this plant contains some very strong , very strong , the serotonin , and the oxygen system is very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the most sophisticated , you &apos;ve seen this stuff , that substance that you have made of different kinds of things also .
this powder is about being shot from a kind of a football event , and the landing of the painting , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to create a bias of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have my professor , richard evan , who &apos;s the man who was the most pessimistic of the magic mushrooms in mexico , and i said , &quot; well , i said that you couldn &apos;t be able to experience this kind of thing as a hallucination , because in the moment you feel the impact , you &apos;re not going to be there to experience a hallucination .
but the thing about the brain is that they can &apos;t be taken in , because they &apos;re in the human gut , of course , by the name of the human gut , and they &apos;re going to be called the name of the name .
you can only get rid of some other chemicals with some other chemicals that mao &apos;s .
now the fascinating thing is that the most amazing thing that contain the most important ones in the world &apos;s brain is the way that they &apos;re necessary to be able to get the power of the way to get the power of the world . so ask yourself .
how can these people from an icy species of 80,000 species can &apos;t find these two types of plants that are not related to plants that are in this way , a kind of a kind of a design version , so that the whole amount of the parts of its parts is ?
we use this great euphemism , trying and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
but you ask the indians , you say , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the most 17 , have 17 varieties of plastic that you all recognize in the forest , which is a way of looking at our eyes as a kind of .
and then you ask them how they &apos;re making their own , and they say , &quot; i thought you &apos;re going to understand something about plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you take every 17 varieties of food in the field of time and you sing to a different set of different forms .
now , this doesn &apos;t bring you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting .
now , the problem is that even the problem of us , the sympathy for the difficult possible situation , they have to look at the wildlife as a function of the world &apos;s and the most powerful , but they &apos;re kind of just on the past , as the real world , is , in the world , is accelerating .
so , the fact is that you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century , in 300 years , or technical innovation , but rather than an era where we were present and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth either actively supported or passive . so the problem is not the change .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new zealand .
and the problem is not the technology .
the most important thing was not to be less on sioux than they stopped and arrow and arrow , when americans stopped being americans when they stopped the horse and the task of the task .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of the world &apos;s integrity ; it &apos;s power . ugly face of the rule .
and wherever you &apos;re in the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures are not the doom of the decline , which is dynamic living peoples , which is being emitted by the visible forces of the land , whether it &apos;s the most powerful , and the most powerful , which is the most powerful , which is the most prolific , which is the most prolific , and the most prolific , which is the most prolific , which is the most prolific , which is the most prolific , which is the most prolific ,
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m going to work a lot of work , you &apos;ll see ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the most violent extinction of people , is generally convicted , but the most vulnerable , the destruction of the human being , is not just being convicted , but generally , as part of a human being celebrated .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of the suffering , if you haven &apos;t experienced it on the ground level .
i was traveling with a young colleagues , 6,000 miles from pac-man in the coastal village , by the glasgow and only when i came to the f. of the statistics , and i was seeing the face behind the statistics of which you were killed , 6,000 sacred monuments that were killed in the cultural revolution .
the father of this young woman was identified as a followers of the original lama .
that meant that he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle fails with her holiness , who brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked in , as punishment for -- to be wealthy for the crime .
he was imprisoned in the prison of two years in prison to hide under her favorite , because she couldn &apos;t live without life .
the sister who did this brave did was brought into a more mature .
one day she came out of a puppet , and she had to put it for a heavy job , and for this kind of thing , she had to work for seven years .
the suffering of the berlin can be testable , but the most powerful mind of people is something more nuanced .
and at the end of the line , we really have a choice . do we want to live in a world of the world &apos;s world , or in a world of diversity , in a world of diversity ?
margaret ornish , the great anthropologist before she died that it &apos;s her greatest fear that we &apos;re moving towards a thread , and we &apos;re not just going to be able to see the whole range of human imagination , and we would have to wake up one day , and we have a dream of the dream of a dream , and we forgot that there was ever other possibilities .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species may have existed since 600,000 years .
the most popular revolution that brought us to agriculture , and we &apos;re in this moment of the cult of the world &apos;s brain , which replaced poetry of the priesthood through the prose of the priesthood and the hierarchy of the priesthood -- just 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we are in the next millennia .
if we ask these myriad types of information to the meaning of human questions , they &apos;re responding to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to be able to bring the possibility to be what we are : people with full consciousness that are aware of the importance that all people and gardens have to be able to flourish , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took on the northern end of the mountain , when i went to the most of the time , and this man , the guy , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather &apos;s story .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the years of the world &apos;s population , the most prolific of our rule , they were forced to pull into settlements .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather refused to be .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit don &apos;t have fear of the cold , they used them to their advantage .
the most popular of her sledge were originally made of fish that was wrapped in the wooden valley .
the man &apos;s grandfather didn &apos;t fear the arctic night or the flying storm .
he was looking outside , he made his pants out of the street , and he &apos;s got a little bit of his hand , and when the feces started to market , he shaped her in the form of a single one .
he &apos;s got the saliva on the side of the mountain and it was completely frozen , he was a dog with it .
he &apos;s got the dog and he was a given a given , took the skeleton of the dog and a ride , a different dog , and he started a different dog , and he was looking at the most powerful dog with the air table .
so you can &apos;t do anything like that .
and this is a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all indigenous people in the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april 1999 , the complete control of a field that &apos;s bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country , and it &apos;s called the &quot; water . &quot;
it &apos;s an independent area . it &apos;s all the most independent .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state , the state of the people who are looking for their people and can reach .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are traveled to these distant goals of earth , that they &apos;re not even away from the ground .
they &apos;re the most prolific of someone .
they represent parts of human imagination , which go back in the past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , are part of the geography of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we believe that politicians never achieve something .
we believe that the most important thing -- we believe that the fact that the belief is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world and so we probably have the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website is 35 million more than every month .
gh nations send our transportation team .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we have a series of trips to the most sophisticated , which we take our audience to places like this , that they were blinded by the things that are blinded and hopefully , they will be able to find a central revelation in the world that we can find a very multicultural world in a really multicultural world where the wisdom of all people can contribute to our collective well-being .
thank you .
what i first do first , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we have microsoft as part of a year ago , and that &apos;s a very , very important one , and it &apos;s a environment where you can either deal with local or distant amounts of visual data .
we see many , many books on digital photographs here , which you can do , and then you can get a new set of things , and you can get a new set of things to be able to do .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of the library of the library and it &apos;s in a field of 300 , and it &apos;s a field of 300 .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that the performance of a system can be like this is the number of pixels on your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of the design .
this is a house house of dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it really is about a text and not about a picture , we can do something like this to really show that this one is a real representation of the brain and no image .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a more powerful way .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a case of a case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a section .
and that &apos;s really what you &apos;re doing , and the good experience of reading a real piece of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of a medium with multiple scales .
we also did something about the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a false display with very high resolution that is much higher than a normal display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specs .
and this really reaches these ideas , these limitations for the available place on the screen .
we hope that this is not a lifesaver and other nonsense , which is not necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i &apos;m really not going to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re going to be able to do this area .
but these are all roads in the united states .
the top on the top of nasa &apos;s picture is the nasa image .
now let &apos;s get something else .
now , this is actually live in the internet . you can do it .
this is a project called the name of the name , which is really two different technologies together .
one is a very good research , and the other is a very good research about the noah who &apos;s from noah , a university student of washington , under the counseling of steve .
and rick &apos;s research was done by microsoft research , a very good collaboration .
so this is live in the internet . it &apos;s driven by the internet .
you can see that if we can create this kind of view , where we can penetrate through images and make these experience of the stress resolution .
but the spatial structure of the images is actually in the matter of meaning .
the most common ones have been held together with these images , and they were in the real room that these images were made in the nearby , which were made in the canadian , and they &apos;re all looking at the same in the relationship of the world , and they &apos;re all in the relationship of the relationship in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are what &apos;s much of the spatial .
i &apos;d like to show you a straight data set of noah and that &apos;s from a early prototype of the first time we &apos;ve been working on the summer to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology that is the most obvious thing that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers , and we had to worry .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral of babylon dame , who &apos;s just in the computer with images of flickr , and just give you a little bit of the pictures of flickr , and you &apos;ll get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the front of the day , and every one of these orange displays is a picture that was discovered as to this model .
so this is all the most sophisticated , and they all stand in the way that they &apos;re in relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i &apos;m going to work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception in here .
i suspect you can see that this is a lot of different cameras : everything is about the professional of the professional , a very large number of them , a pretty large number of them all in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird ones .
many of you are covered by faces .
there &apos;s a series of photographs here -- here they are .
this is actually a poster of notre dame , which was really recorded .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point is that we can do things with social environment , and now we &apos;re going to get data from all -- from the whole collective memory of how , visual the earth looks like -- and everything is connected .
all these photos are connected to each other , and it &apos;s something that &apos;s bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from all the earth .
look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen kamen &apos;s work .
and that &apos;s something that is through the complexity , with the people that are using it , and the use of the user is getting bigger .
their own photos are going to be with a mile , which has a different person .
if someone has done the trouble and all of these sacred identified , and who they are all told , then my photo is going to be all the time of the babylon , and i can use it as a starting point to use the other of the other players , and so i can use it to be a kind of a kind of a social experience of social experience .
and of course , byproduct of all of this are the immense rich models of every interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not just through the surface of the earth , and that &apos;s not just by the collective memory .
thank you .
do i understand it right ? your software allows you to have a certain time within the next few years , all the images that are used by someone in the world , basically , in the world ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t make anything else than discover .
if you want to make them , they &apos;re making them the same .
and it &apos;s doing this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the amount of the brain &apos;s information that many of these images have .
as if you do a little bit of a video for images , where you &apos;re going to put sentences and the text of the website , a lot of information that &apos;s the picture .
but how would it be , if the picture is connected to all of your images ?
then the volume of the brain &apos;s wiring and the abundance of the body that makes it really , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic classic .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , how i hope to be in unison with other things that you &apos;ve already heard about , and i &apos;m going to try to create some connections , if you haven &apos;t noticed this .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official &quot; official .
the official of what ?
the official of all western societies in the industrialized industrialized societies .
the official business system works like this : if our goal is to maximize the common of our citizens , it &apos;s all about the most important of the freedom of the individual .
the reason that is that freedom is good in itself , valuable , meaning , a more powerful assumption for human .
if people have freedom , everybody is about to do things for themselves , to maximize our good and not to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply that it would not come to the sense of the mind .
and it &apos;s also deeply rooted in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what makes us modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say something about the ted story .
there &apos;s 175 main sheets in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t get the 10 different extra extra extra extra extra pieces of light and 12 and 12 , which you could buy to make a big number of their own squares in the store , which is unlikely , that no one &apos;s the last one in the store .
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the business store to put a stereo -- speakers , a speaker , a radio , radio , radio , and in this one electronics , there &apos;s so many stereo plants .
we can put a million different stereo in different regular plants , which are going to be offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , because you could have every phone , you wanted to have a phone , as long as he came from ma bell .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
one consequence of that was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have a infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is in the middle -- the middle of the middle -- and a computer-generated , computer-generated torch .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that , you can &apos;t have seen it in your business , you can be sure it will be soon .
and what it does is it makes people run into business and ask this question .
now , you know what the answer is to this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life , which is very important than buying the objects of objects , the same explosion of choice is to be true .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could make a do or we could make b .
a has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift of the burden of responsibility for someone knows about the people &apos;s own thing -- including the doctor &apos;s -- to someone who &apos;s not a choice , and that &apos;s why the patient &apos;s not in the best constitution .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like them and me , if they think about it , because we don &apos;t have any sense of it .
why do you advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , you expect to call the doctor &apos;s next morning and ask a change of the prescription .
something so profound about our identity is now a question of choice , how to show this slide .
we don &apos;t inherit identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re so often reinventing ourselves as we want .
that means that every day , if you wake up the morning , you need to decide what a kind of person wants to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where the most common one was that almost every one had one and that they could get married as quickly as they could , and then they got so fast kids like they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that .
now , it &apos;s all just to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i get married ?
should i later marry ? should i have kids , or just do a career ? &quot;
these are all the questions that are all about .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether that means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m going to give you , and not a good note in my class .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important questions to be asking .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl demonstrates , with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every day of every single place on the planet -- until the most cosmopolitan hotel .
there &apos;s a corner of the corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you about , which is the most powerful thing that i &apos;m going to do .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions , again , and again , if we should work or not work .
we can watch our children playing football , and we have our mobile phone on one hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and even if you &apos;re all off , every minute we &apos;re going to ask our child to the break of a child &apos;s child , we also should , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even though the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be your experience of the child &apos;s experience , very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and little things , material things and lifestyle , is a question of choice .
and the world we were living in the way that we lived .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not all of it was a question of choice .
and the world we &apos;re seeing now is this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to do something bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , the way it &apos;s , is that it &apos;s going to be flooded instead of free .
so with so many options you can choose , people are very hard to decide to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another more sophisticated example of this , a study of investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to the most violent of the plastic , the giant plastic of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 of the 10 times the employer that was offered the participation to two percent .
they provide 50 percent of them -- 10 percent less employees than if they only offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 more powerful , which is to be the choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide what you want to pick it up tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never come .
you know , that &apos;s not just what people have to eat when they go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go to the burning , it means that they &apos;re making the decisions that they miss great amounts of their employer .
they &apos;re not participation by the age of 5,000 u.s. dollars a year , which would have been happy to reproduce their contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
and i think it &apos;s going to make the world look like this .
they really want to make the decision right when it &apos;s for all the eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund , or even the wrong thing .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end up with less happy with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is , by the great choice of different kinds of information , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is a perfect thing , it &apos;s just a different decision to make the decision that they had made a decision , and what &apos;s going on is that they have a different decision to make the decision that they had made of their decision , and what &apos;s going on is that they have a choice of choice .
the more ways there are , the easier it is to regret at all , that &apos;s disappointing the choice they meet .
second , what economists call the military revolution .
dan gilbert has made a big point of this morning by telling how much the way we judge things , depends on what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to think about , it &apos;s just attractive properties of alternatives that they &apos;re pursuing , which makes them feel less happy with the alternatives that they chose .
here &apos;s an example . for the one of you who are not new york , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . they have all of them .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; man thinks &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my neighborhood is gone .
i could park directly from my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks of the thought that he &apos;s missed the possibility of day , day , a great parking lot .
and the satisfaction of happiness is the happiness we get through our selection , even if what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more possibilities that there are the choices , the more attractive properties of these choices are going to be taking place in the world .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon is a few statements .
he makes a statement about life now and maybe things slow to do about it .
but a more important point he &apos;s doing is , always who you decide to do for one thing , you don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things like many attractive qualities , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do less powerful .
third , the expectations of expectations .
this was what i met when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost the whole time .
and there was a time in the only way that there was a kind of jeans , and they bought them , and they have bad , they were incredibly reactive and they were incredibly preserved , and they had a lot of enough , and they &apos;ve been starting to feel &quot; ok . &quot;
so to buy new jeans , after many years of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the salesmen said , &quot; do you want a decent , easy , or a big ?
do you want buttons or half ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you want to cut down far , you know , blah , blah blah , blah , and so on .
my jaw was down and after i recovered , i &apos;d like to have the way that the only way was the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour with all of these damn jeans , and down the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best right jeans i ever had .
i had better . all these choices allowed me to have better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it to myself .
the reason i felt worse was that i felt bad with all these available possibilities , my expectations for what a good pair of jeans is , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations than it was in a kind of way .
when they came in 100 ways , it would have been perfect , one of them would have perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i expected to do , and what i had was , i was disappointing , and what i expected was to be a comparison .
and the addition of opportunities in the lives of people are inevitably increasing expectations that people have to be about how well these possibilities are going to be .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world knows this , because if you would , you know , you know , you don &apos;t know what it is .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that it was all better than anything was worse than anything was worse than anything was worse , it was possible to make people experience a pleasant surprise .
today in the world we live -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best for that you can ever hope is the things that you expect to do .
they &apos;re never going to be comfortable because their expectations , my expectations , are big .
the secret to the most important -- that &apos;s what they all came from -- the secret to the most -- the secret to the most low .
i want to say -- a short moment of a moment -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t have a lot of time .
but shut down is not always a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of a bad sitting sitting in a bad jeans , when there &apos;s only one kind of purchase , if you &apos;re a little bit of a way , and you &apos;re wondering why , who is responsible , the answer is , what would you do ?
if hundreds of different types of jeans are available , and they buy one of the disappointing , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to the question : it &apos;s .
they could have done it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , if people make decisions , and even if the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant -- not the only , but a significant , significant thing to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced the improvise because they &apos;re so high , and then they have to explain their fault .
and so the most important thing is that it &apos;s generally better , objective , and we feel bad .
so let me remind you .
this is the official business system that we all think of right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow , but it doesn &apos;t follow more choices than something .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time to make our good lives .
now , as a rule of question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a rule , the thing that is about thinking about it . what all these choices allow in the industrialized societies is the material of wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of them whose problem is not too big .
your problem is that you have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry is steve levitt told you about how these expensive and hard car seats don &apos;t help to help the car seats . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
they &apos;re even hurt .
they &apos;re worried about that we &apos;re bad .
if something of what people are allowed to make our society make decisions like that , people in the societies have shifted to too little choices , wouldn &apos;t only be improving the lives of people , but we would also improve our dignity .
economists call this a nuclear application .
and it &apos;s going to be a lot of time that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all these big choices are all of us .
finally , read this cartoon , and , you know , a very advanced person , and , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this kind of thing . &quot;
1.8 imagination , a more powerful view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to think about the fish that the fish know .
because the truth is that if you break the most , it &apos;s so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the water , it &apos;s so that everything is possible , you get the happiness .
they increase the paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a more powerful .
this is almost safe to limited -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the most important thing about a metaphor is a recipe for misery , and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what could mean , and about the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology and now try to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new lives and build .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried to make different approaches to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve been digitized almost 20 years . when we sequenced the most sophisticated , the change of the analog world of biology is the digital world of biology .
now , we try to ask if we can regenerate life or can we make new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma , which has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we tried to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it on a hundred genes of the 500 or something that &apos;s here .
but if we look at this metabolic map that is very simple , compared to our own trust , it &apos;s simple , but if we look at all of these genes we can eliminate one of the other genes that we can eliminate one of the other things that we can do is a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to go forward , this chromosome is actually to be able to vary what allows us to vary the individual components and to ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we get a chromosome ?
does it allow chemistry to make this really big molecule , which hasn &apos;t been done before ?
and , if we can , we can start this chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
our steps at the translation of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has been very slow , but yet , we &apos;ve been able to put it on an exponential curve now .
we started with this 15 years ago .
it actually took some years to start with a tour review before we did the first experiments .
and it turns out that it &apos;s very difficult to do .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a piece of a process that &apos;s going to happen , the more mistakes you do .
so we had to develop a new method with that we could put these little pieces together and correct the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x .
it &apos;s a little virus killing bacteria .
we made small pieces , made a error error and a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of chemical chemical and gave them a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then released by the cells , and they came back and killed e. coli .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said they really understood this model .
they laughed more than they do here .
so we think that this is a situation in the software actually can build its hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole universal chromosome . it has more than a more than a black letter of genetic code . so we thought we &apos;re building it in cassette tapes from the size of the virus , which is the size of the individual cell .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information really is accurate .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the most popular thing was a mistake of a 10,000 base base .
we found 30 mistakes in the world , if we had used the original sequence , it never had been possible .
part of the design is to create pieces that are 50 letters long , and they have to overlap with other people &apos;s pieces to build smaller amounts of water that fit these .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built it in .
think about it : we have a new code : a , c , g and t.
and the letters of this letter -- this letter encode about 20 amino acids ; and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we just signed up with signed .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we &apos;ve designed the pieces that we could just break them with enzymes , and there are enzymes that repair these and bring them back together .
and we started making pieces , starting with the five to the five to the letter of the five to the other letter , to make these together to rebuild these together , to the back of the world .
in every step , we have this pieces of stuff that we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get the point of the world &apos;s point .
so , this looks like a computer designer .
if we get to these right big pieces -- with 100,000 base pairs -- then they &apos;re not going to be just growing in e. coli , and it &apos;s all the possibilities of modern molecular biology , and so we used to do other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of the world &apos;s mechanism called the biology that uses biology to repair dna that can bring these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s a organism called the so-called the three million rads of radiation in radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything has been going to fill together like it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely dried , they can even live in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life exists in space and can move to the search of aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a key of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve used it only to use the right design of the pieces of the pieces , we have it automatically , yeast , then , automatically put it together .
this is not a regular , regular blood system .
it &apos;s a big molecule that we can even see it with the most powerful .
these are footage about a long six seconds .
that &apos;s the publication we &apos;ve just done recently .
these are about the most popular letters of the code of the code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with the structure of the structure that has ever been created by people .
it has a more powerful of over 300 million .
if we would print it with a computer of 10 and without distances , it would include the pages of the pages , just to make this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus , it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier when you &apos;re in the way we &apos;re doing it , you just take the nucleus out and you have another in the same , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the clone .
in the cell , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but only recently we showed that you can do a complete transplant of a chromosome to another , and that can activate .
we were documenting the chromosome of a laser , and , roughly , these two are from each other , and we were able to choose some of these , and we could choose some of these things , and we could choose to destroy it with enzymes , and it was very amazing to us in a cell -- and it was very amazing to be in a cell .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that there is the end , but we tried to get the process to get something further .
this is the most important of evolution here .
we &apos;re all finding species here , and we &apos;ve taken a second chromosome , or a third of the kind of a single chromosome , every time thousands of characteristics in just one second .
so people who think of evolution as a gene is going to have changed a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called the most primitive , which actually digest dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no one ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve added already .
it was in the cell , and it realized the other chromosome as foreign material , and so we had just one cell with a new chromosome .
it &apos;s the blue , because of the genes we put on .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species and converted completely into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we have to go running .
it may sound like genomic engineering , but we can , by moving the most dramatic , things quite dramatic .
now i argued that this is not the most important thing -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i have argued that we may be able to create a new form of the cambrian explosion in which there could be massive new new types of technology based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re in the next 40 billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context : i was born in 1946 .
today , three people in this planet are born in the year for every year , within 40 years , it &apos;s going to be four .
we have problems with food , with fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
it will offer a challenge for nine .
we need about five billion tons of coal , and we need to have billions of barrels of oil , and that &apos;s a hundred million barrels per day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace this , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material that lands in the atmosphere .
we now have , from our discoveries from all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the most important the future of the future .
the most powerful one had a dozen components and see the diversity of that .
we &apos;re going to be here in the first line of the biological reality and the idea of our imagination .
we have technologies today because of this fast , to do what we call the genetics of genetics .
we have now the opportunity to build a big robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine these 20 million different genes , or to optimize these processes to make food , or drugs , we can change a little bit more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just selection selection . we can get to the fossil flu , production of chemicals or the chemicals that are so on .
this is a shot of actual design that we &apos;re working on , and we &apos;re actually going to start designing new species in the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it will look like it , we know exactly how to look at the genetic code .
we &apos;re now focusing on fuel of the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn recently , which is just a bad experiment .
we have fuel of the fuel and third generation , and the third generation will be coming out of the very soon , as a way of the food , or different species of plastic .
but , as we think the only way we think about biology is a big impact without any more increase in food or the limitation of their availability , if we see co2 as a source of co2 , and therefore we work on cells that go to this path .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery , we have all kinds of different ways of doing .
this is a organism we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about a month , about a month of almost a little bit of time , in almost a little bit of time .
it &apos;s turning co2 into methane to use hydrogen as a source of hydrogen .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use carbon dioxide , which could be just being brought to the surface of the co2 , which could be put in the fuel , to drive the co2 .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- we have -- the targets like the whole drip industry of the entire drip industry . right . if you couldn &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? a key one of the energy .
but we &apos;re working on the same way that we &apos;re using the same approaches to the development of vaccines .
they saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year back , and we have a dollar to little , if it &apos;s about the right vaccine .
i think that &apos;s going to be changed by creating vaccines in the field of water .
this is how the future might look like the future , can be accelerated today , and now , today , the most synthetic bacteria can be accelerated with synthetic bacteria , and perhaps the most powerful .
we &apos;re moved away from people to improve people , and our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you .
and on the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far . and for all those who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that was ever been addressed -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a second second after the universe -- and that to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine below geneva .
we take images of these online centers in detectors .
i &apos;m working on this . he &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 feet in the width , 22 feet in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction that you see the scale .
at the 10th of september last year , the machine was going to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it &apos;s caused huge amounts of control in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first , which is the entire route to make the lhc , then , with a part of the lhc , to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture on september 10th , we knew that the machine works , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this is the biggest largest design system , or this , when someone went to google side and the front page .
it means we reached a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires here -- this golden wires here .
these wires are running out of the air , when the machine runs on the street .
now , the engineers under them will look at them and say , &quot; no , don &apos;t do that . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you &apos;re very far down , you &apos;ll be called the so-called carbon dioxide .
so , in minus homer degrees , cooler than the space between stars , these wires can be the tension .
in one of the connections between the surface of the sun , there was a plastic factory .
and so , by turning the wires up , they suddenly have a more electric resistance .
this was the result .
now , this is even wonderful when you imagine that the magnet weigh over 20 tons and move around about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we called them new , they &apos;re called .
they &apos;re all back to their way back .
and the lhc will be functional again .
we will turn it to it , and we &apos;ll expect to collect the first data in june or july , and we &apos;re going to go on to see our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , in a way of a kind of spark of accidents , again , the debate of science and engineering on borders , it &apos;s easy to reject something like that .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to reach the fact that we &apos;re going to reach beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words , a english scientist , and i &apos;m going to leave you with the other scientist , who i suspect when he was attacking the most powerful experiments of his life , his apprentice , he said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of human mind , &quot; that we have our scientific ideas , that our scientific ideas are more , that we have our scientific ideas , that our scientific ideas are more .
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my job , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big life , dear love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that to change that .
but the recent thing is a recent thing in my life , and my career has happened to me that i &apos;ve got to rethink my relationship with this work completely .
this strange event was that i recently wrote a book -- a biography called the book of a book called the , loving love , love , love -- that decided to be different than all my previous books in the world and a big , international , international , international engineering .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to get treated as if i &apos;m going to the fall .
seriously -- the fall of the fall .
for example , you &apos;re going to get to me , and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you never get rid of this success ?
don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re going to have your whole life and never create a book that anyone in the world cares about ? never again ?
okay , that &apos;s really what makes you courage .
but it would be worse when i didn &apos;t remember that i was going to be a teenager for the first time when i was a teenager for the first time , i was told to be a writer with the same kind of engineering response .
people said , &quot; did you not fear , never succeed ?
did you not fear that you kill the humiliation of a letter ?
do you have no fear that you &apos;re going to have your life long and never come out of it and you &apos;re going to die on a computer party , and you &apos;re going to die on a car &apos;s dream of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : yes , yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had .
and i &apos;ve been afraid of a lot more things that nobody would recognize .
like algae -- and other scary things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it for recently and question , why ?
is that sensible ?
is it logical that by someone &apos;s expected to be afraid that he &apos;s afraid to do the work that he feels ?
and what about the creative enterprise that you &apos;re doing is to make us insecure about the underlying mind -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemist and i can &apos;t remember a chemist in his 40 years when he was asked to be a chemist .
with your favorite , john -- how do you do it ?
it just didn &apos;t come , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of the chemist has not given the reputation of the people &apos;s reputation .
we seem to have the kind of call , but not only the writers , but the creative of all the olympic , seem to have this call , mentally unstable .
everything you need to do is look at the bitter , really great head of really great minds from the 20th century , who died and often died of your own hand .
and even the ones who don &apos;t actually have the interest of their talents seemed to be really neglected by their talents .
norman ornish said a little bit about his death in his last interview : the one of my books killed me a little bit more .
a remarkable statement that you can do about your life &apos;s work .
but we don &apos;t even know if we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve seen this kind of statements since so long . somehow we have the notion of that , and we &apos;re very collective that creativity and suffering -- the end of the end -- always leads to the end of the day .
the question i want to ask you today is : is this idea for you all right ?
you feel like you &apos;re going to be looking at this ? because just a centimeter , i don &apos;t feel like this , i &apos;m not feeling at all .
i think they &apos;re doing it .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to watch how you get taken into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we encourage our great creative creative .
and i definitely know that it &apos;s for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start , to start this dark path of the idea of the idea of the kind of thing that i &apos;m in my career right now .
this is -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 more , more than 40 .
and it &apos;s extremely likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now is the world &apos;s work as the work that &apos;s been successful after the most successful of my last book , right ?
i say it &apos;s a little bit of the time , because we &apos;re all now friends -- it &apos;s very likely to be my biggest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that someone can get to start to get nine o &apos;clock in the morning , drink gin . and i don &apos;t want to .
i would rather continue to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of the most popular , i seem to be able to write to write a way of designing a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a nuclear psychological construct .
somehow , i have to find a way to get a safe distance to true , and i &apos;m very natural about how the reaction is going to be on the writing .
while i was looking for models of models for doing this , i also looked for the past and i tried to find other societies to see if they might have better or more of the ideas that are related to creativity .
this quest to me in the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will be close again .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of meritocratic , unknown source of the people coming from a distant , unknown source of people -- from the street , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these divine folk scientists of creativity , the demons .
by socrates , he believed he believed he had a more threatening , which he would have to know from the distance .
the roman had the same idea , called this kind of kind of creative creative mind , a genius genius .
this is great . the roman thought didn &apos;t really mean that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical divine creature , which was believed that it was literally living in the walls of a football system -- about as much as the kind of energy , the most primitive and the artist in work , and the result of work was invisible .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s this , because it &apos;s the distance i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked like this , right ?
the artist of the world &apos;s office was protected in a certain way , like , for example , too much bribe , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at all of you for you , and everybody knew that you had this kind of genius genius that helped you .
if your work is going to be , not entirely your fault , right ?
everybody knew her genius was a little paralyzed .
so the people in the west really have thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- all the gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no room for the mystic creatures that are going to take orders from the divine .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism and people started believing that creativity was completely from their individual individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people call this or an artist , and instead of calling that he &apos;s got a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think to allow a naked person that he thinks he or she &apos;s like the vessel , like the pelvis and the essence of all the divine , creative , unknown , infinite mystery is a little bit too much responsibility to make a human psyche .
it &apos;s like asking someone to eat the sun .
the emperor and distorted whole egos and it creates all these dives of expectations to success .
i think that this is the most recent thing that we &apos;ve been doing in the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to a ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creative return .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just eradicate the growth of 500 years of rational humanism in a very much more effective talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would really be blogging , who would be a really popular scientific doubt about the idea of -- basically -- -- -- -- the people who are struggling and they &apos;re using their projects and apply them to their projects .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to address is : why not ?
why not think about it ?
because it makes sense as much sense as anything i &apos;ve heard about when it was about explaining the absolute crazy thing of the creative process .
a process that -- like everyone knows that it &apos;s ever tried to make something -- so in other words , in fact , everyone here -- not always , always , compassion .
in fact , he can feel really a really valid thing .
i had a close encounter recently as i met the extraordinary american poet , which is now about 90 , but she was a whole poet , and she told me that she was growing up as she was growing in the fields of virginia . she said she could feel and hear how a poem was about the landscape on her .
she said it would be like a train train .
the country on them would be going to be on the ground .
she felt , because it would come , because it would bring the earth under the feet .
she knew that she could only do one in such a moment , and that was -- in her words -- in her words -- the hell of the devil .
they ran like the devil to the house as they were tracking from this poem , and it was just that they had to get fast enough to a sheet of paper and a pen so that they could get it through them , and put it on the sheet .
in other words , she was not very fast enough , and they ran and ran and ran , but they didn &apos;t get the house and they were making the poem through them and they were told , and she would say , &quot; well , it would go on to a different poet . &quot;
and then there were these moments -- the part i never forget -- she said that there were moments in which they were almost missed it .
so , she runs to the house and he &apos;s looking for paper and the poem through her and she &apos;s taking a pen as it &apos;s through them and then she said -- she was like , it was like that with her other hand , and it &apos;s going to get it to be able to get it .
they caught the poem on his tail and he pulled it back into their body and took it on the sheet of paper .
and this is the opportunity that the poem came up with , and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
when i heard that , i was a little bit skeptical -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going to be .
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a computer designer . i have to get up to the same time , and i have to sweat every day , and i &apos;m really uncomfortable with it , and really awkward .
but even i have this thing in my favorite room sometimes , sometimes .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
even i had work or ideas that made out of a source of me , which i really don &apos;t really identify .
what is this for a thing ?
and how do we get to lose with our minds without losing our minds , but to keep ourselves in the opposite of mental health ?
for me , the best living example is how to create this , the musicians tom , i was going to interview him a few years ago .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of his life was tom the embodiment of the modern artist , who tried to master this , and to engage with them .
but then he became older and quiet . he told me that he was going to los angeles , and there was all of it in los angeles .
he went to high speed as he suddenly hears a little fragment of a melody , which is how it &apos;s often been difficult for him to be a lot of physical , and he wants to have it . she &apos;s going to be able to do it . he &apos;s not able to believe it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil .
so he starts to get this old , old , and he &apos;s going to be able to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be tracking this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t do it .
but instead of getting out of panic , he just stopped .
he ended up all the train and did something completely new .
he just looked at the sky and said , &quot; sorry , can you see that i &apos;m driving car ? &quot;
so , i think , i think , as i could just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a second moment , if i can take care of you .
if not , somebody else &apos;s day .
go and get leonard cohen .
his whole process has changed after that .
not the work itself . it was still as dark as ever as it was .
but the process and the heavy design system that surrounds him was , when he was the genius of the genius , where he was not going to be in trouble , and he was walking out where he was in the way he came from . he realized that it didn &apos;t have to be a fair thing .
it could give a strange , surprising , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the stranger , central thing that was not tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit like i worked and it has been saved .
this idea saved me as i was in the middle of the middle of the street , and i was in the middle of the street , love , love , and i fell in one of these these these two things that we all fall when we work on something and not work . you start thinking that it &apos;s going to be a disaster .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just be able to get the project out .
but then i remembered how tom had spoken in the free sky , and i tried it .
so i took my look at the manuscript , and i talked to my comment towards a blank corner of the room .
i spoke to him , &quot; listen , you know , you know , you and i know both if this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i &apos;m all investing , i &apos;m not investing . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to pop up here and follow your share .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , then you know what the hell is .
i &apos;m going to write on , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you a report that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like following . centuries ago , in the deserts of the desert , people have gathered up with sacred dances and music that were left hours for hours -- until dawn .
these were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , something special happened . one of the actors was actually a lot of the time .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen a performance in your life once .
it was as if the time was going to be a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a computer . he did nothing else than he ever did -- 1,000 nights before . but all of them add together .
and suddenly he didn &apos;t appear in human history anymore .
it was lit up by the inside and down and down and everything is going to be a divine fire .
when something happened then , people knew what that was . they called it at his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : &quot; ugh , allah , allah , god , god , god . &quot;
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historical , when the most exciting of the ocean came out , they took this practice . the netizens changed over the centuries of the centuries of the world &apos;s disease , allah , allah , the oceanic , the most powerful , the most powerful , and the most powerful thing you &apos;re hearing in the world .
if a performer in spain is doing something impossible , something magical has done : the existential allah , the unions , the nano , great , educated , great , educated , which is a glimpse of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need it .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning when the dancers wake up and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he doesn &apos;t have a more of a designer &apos;s name of god .
he &apos;s just an aging knee with a child &apos;s knee , and maybe he will never get back to those heights .
and maybe someone will never call god &apos;s name , if he &apos;s going to go . but what do he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most popular numerical collider of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of anguish if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence of your existence is coming from you .
if you might just believe that you &apos;re a loan -- from a spectacular source for a time of your life , that &apos;s passed on someone else &apos;s life , if you &apos;re done with it .
if we start thinking about this , it changes all .
so i started thinking and i think that i &apos;m going to be with security in the past months , while i was working on the book , which is soon going to be -- as the dangerous , frightening , strong , expected of my life .
what i &apos;ve got to say constantly when i &apos;m going to get crazy , is not fear .
not a fool .
just do your job .
it &apos;s still for your contribution to what it is , whatever he might be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the dumb divine genius , that &apos;s what you &apos;re asking to be a little bit of a moment , you decide to show a little bit of wonder by your effort , then you &apos;re going to be able to get a little bit of a miracle .
and if not , dance still , your dance .
and the most powerful thing , for you , is all of that .
i think it &apos;s and i feel that we should teach this .
and the most important thing for you ! for you , for all of you , just for you , you know , you just have the only human love and the most powerful , for being there .
thank you .
thank you .
the question !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic sea &apos;s ocean , which had almost three million years of the size of the lower 48 states , has gone down 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t push very enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .
in a certain sense , the arctic is the most appropriate heart of our global health system .
it grows in winter and it &apos;s freezing in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a little bit of a design of what happened in the last 25 years .
the most important thing is to cross red .
as you can see , it &apos;s growing on the dark dark , and this is the annual ice in winter ; it &apos;s in the summer .
this is called the so-called , five years old , or older , almost like blood , which is out of the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here .
this is a problem , because warming is the frozen reason to put the arctic ocean in the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s huge amounts of carbon dioxide , which , if it &apos;s a lot of the microbes , it &apos;s being implemented by microbes .
compared to the whole amount of information , in the atmosphere , that amount of magnitude could double , if we cross this critical point .
today , in some flat lakes in alaska , methane methane is from itself from the water .
professor merchant walter , in the university of alaska , is to another new sea in the last winter of the last winter .
wow !
you &apos;re good . the question is , how will it be a bit of us ?
and one reason is , this enormous heat cooling greenland is from the north .
this is a year of a year .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is the most salient river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how sea level goes up through the sea level , you &apos;re going to be able to get into the ocean .
these rivers take fast .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest largest oil system on the planet .
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent has a negative light system .
and the most important thing that we showed about a few of the things is particularly strong in the melt .
this is 20 feet underground , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the most powerful , you see new lakes , you see , the top of a few years ago , glaciers were a few years ago .
40 percent of all people on the world get half of their own family .
in the andean precipice , this glacier is the most powerful for this city .
the most common ones have been expanding .
but if you &apos;re going to get out of the water , most of the water is falling .
in california , a 40 percent reduction was seen in the sierra economy .
this is the most important thing .
and the predictions , as you read them , are serious .
this is the whole world that leads to a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters around the world have never been increasing in a really valid and previously unprecedented degree .
four times in the last 30 years like the most prolific solar-powered .
this is a completely valid of the water .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s going to be .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 all 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific , the american continent of west and wild of the indian continent , where there &apos;s a radical decline of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning from fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most common problem .
the united states is one of the most largest largest oil systems , together with china .
and the suggestion was to build many more of the other more sophisticated .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that were taken in the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
and there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the most important and the most powerful dollar have spent a dollar dollar last last year to promote clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
in order to go around christmas , i went home in tennessee , a billion tons of water .
they &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is in our entire country of the world &apos;s country &apos;s country .
this happened christmas .
one of the commercials of the world &apos;s christmas story was that .
the most powerful thing is a computer designer , happy fellow .
there &apos;s a lot of it in the skin and a lot of america , and it helps to grow our economy .
the most common thing is that the most sweet one is clean .
it &apos;s affordable and it &apos;s a lot of the workers , and workers stay in loans and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful animal is the head of the internet &apos;s head .
let me tell you a very clear thing . al gore , nancy , harry , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection has been called two .
this is one part of her .
in the most recent , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
so we put it on the top of the top , a significant state of education to spend a significant , a major way to get the truth on the way to the truth of coal .
the fact is , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s also good .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s leave that quiet .
coal coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean , clean .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean water .
and yet , the burning of coal of the main global warming is the remarkable clean , which you see here , changes everything .
look at it right , this is the right , clean , clean .
finally , the positive alternative of our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis that the economy , the national security crisis , the climate crisis .
the red thread that all connects this together is our dependence on the fossil fuels like dirty coal and the oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us from this kind of thing .
and the u.s. is new to 100 percent clean electricity within the next 10 years .
a plan , to bring america back to work , to make us safer and help to stop global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
the americas is new . find more out .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a u.s. of america .
one of the fastest ways of our dependence on old , dirty fuels , which are bound to reduce our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to make good jobs for good jobs .
the americas is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african adage : &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
we have to come far , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start asking you to ask the time of your childhood , when you played with a computer game .
while you realized how to reach the hands and get the hands out , the most powerful and move , they actually learned to think and solve problems through understanding and change the relationship .
the spatial idea is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- with my favorite , and my colleagues , i started to wonder , what if we were using computers , i started to wonder , what if we could use computers that are going to be a flat , and they could organize it like a digital , and they could organize it like we could do it ?
this question was so moving that we decided to explore the answer and developed the answer .
and a second , a computer designer is a interactive computer in the size of a computer .
you can be moved with your hand , you can see each other , you can detect your movements and you have a screen and a laser .
much more importantly , are physically , why you can only move them out of the hands of hands and access .
and the most important one is an example of a new generation of the manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools are going to be physical and a conscious awareness for their movements , each other can recognize and see the edges of our own , and then we can start to start with exploration of new and entertaining .
i start with some simple examples .
this is the most powerful thing for the most violent , and if i put it in a direction , the video will play forward ; if i put it in the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits are taking each other true .
so if i put them side-by-side , they make their interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the ones , you can see that and you can get something nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and their tendency .
a interesting consequence of the interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures to data like color , like color , how to do this with the fluid .
in this case , we have three main types of energy as a computer designer , and i can use it to pour color in the middle of the middle where they &apos;re going to mix .
if we go ahead , we can do a little bit of a little bit more .
there are also some nice ways of education , as languages , math or engineering , where we give people the opportunity to get the opportunity to get fast and see the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci series that i &apos;m making with a simple kind of a simple piece of design .
this is a game with words that is kind of a mixture of a mixture of the and a kind of mixture of the brain .
basically , you get every round of every round of the game , and you &apos;re trying to form words , and you &apos;re trying to make words , you &apos;ll be tested by a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , it &apos;s going to be mixed and you have a new kind of new opportunity and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came up on a trip to the media lab , and i could move it to try and get it out and put a video of it .
they really loved it .
a more interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
everything you have to say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest , recent , the bottom right there .
it turns out he wanted to just stack up the world &apos;s test .
so for him , they were just a little bit of a plastic .
this is an interactive computer system .
we wanted to develop a design system for the design system .
this is called the heart .
he can bring new characters into the scene by putting the most of the table off the table , which shows this character .
here he is going to be the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he &apos;s going to get a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the most flexible and you can put it side-by-side , it can interact with the characters ...
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end and it can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example i &apos;ve been doing today is to show you a little bit of a design for the design of the world that we &apos;ve developed recently and in the field of sound as sound , as a sound , bass and drums .
each one has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can put in any patterns .
and you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a time by holding a little bit of a stick on a computer .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filters .
you connect it with a certain note and it tends to be the urge .
and then even more accelerated effects like speed and volume that you &apos;re doing on the whole sequence .
so let &apos;s look at it .
we start in the world that we &apos;re going to do in two main types of water and these in a series of ways , extend them and add a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something like that .
and now i &apos;m going to hook the filter with the drums , so i can control the effect live .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by putting the pace into one or another direction .
and now i &apos;m going to hook up the filter with the bass .
i can change the sequence as it &apos;s going to change .
so , i don &apos;t have to plan them in the front of the front , but it can improvise ; they &apos;re increasing or more .
and finally , i can choose the whole sequence by running the most important to the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my excitement is to develop new design tools that are better to fit how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new computer and some of the possibilities that we work in our lab .
the idea i want to give you to the way is that we &apos;re on the verge of this new generation of design to interaction with digital media , which is the information that we have in our world , which is our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m very pleased to talk to you all .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m very pleased to be there .
yeah , so what &apos;s going to be like ?
i just have to go back to a little bit , and it &apos;s just a little bit of a time with modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology and i &apos;ve been studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been starting to do that because i just wanted to know , and it was really , i wanted to know , and it was also going to be a lot of time , which i learned in the study of theoretical theory .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity and i wanted to get closer to the matter , so .
i think that molecular biology is generally speaking , so it &apos;s all spoken , biotechnology , everything you count to do synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now , is extremely important , and much more importantly , it will be in the future .
there &apos;s so controversial things like this all the way that plants changed in the field of plants .
now there &apos;s craig venter in the world &apos;s office , which is trying to make a lot of the fuel , so gas from algae .
and then there &apos;s also things that are totally in the everyday life , which is most people not aware of , for example , for example , to wash us with 40 degrees of laundry , also genetically enzymes .
and the list can continue on the list .
and so from interest on this technology , i &apos;m just going to continue to go on to this technology .
so what &apos;s the thing that &apos;s going to be like ?
most people know the most people from the most violent .
computers hack , and then it will always be like this , yes , the hackers break somewhere and claws and so on .
this is kind of a very sad thing for the most powerful , because it doesn &apos;t really do what it actually has started , and what &apos;s actually behind it .
and that &apos;s the most important thing , in the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , and it &apos;s also made the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can be just a basic problem , which is how things simplify , so any more of a matter , a question , and how can you do that better or how you can do that better .
and it was just a little bit of software , but there &apos;s also a software in the field , but there &apos;s also a whole whole whole , which is a whole whole bunch of things that are going to do with the whole type of things .
and now , just as we &apos;re in biology , and i want to take this metaphor , which is that we &apos;re going to take that metaphor , that biology is actually a very straightforward code , because , the most important code is a more abstract code , which is , it &apos;s not just the same as computers , because it &apos;s matter , because it &apos;s matter , so it &apos;s a matter of matter .
but it &apos;s also a code , and it can also code and can also be able to use it , so that i think , and i found that i was incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper with it .
it actually has just taken more than two really , really , that these networks .
there &apos;s a lot of dry dotcom , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with cooperation in india , but now , in india , and active people everywhere , or active people around the world .
these are the more artistic moves , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and collaboration with scientists with these technologies , and to ask questions about these technologies , and to make questions , and to process it , there &apos;s a lot of things .
but it &apos;s always about finding a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a practical approach to having a playful deal with it .
and then there &apos;s a dried dotcom , and there &apos;s a lot of dry water .
this is from the most violent , which is actually more like a forum , where you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it online and online .
they &apos;re a little bit of a technical approach , and also a little bit of a little bit of a time , and then they &apos;re going to ask , yes , the questions .
and based on these networks that have made the whole popular , it &apos;s been developed as a scene that i want to be a little bit of social .
here in the picture on the left , you see the same thing that &apos;s a little bit of a school , so basically a kind of school , so basically a school , a private school , a nonprofit institution , where everyone can get .
children , old , all kinds of people go to this , just to have a lab , and they have a lab , and look at what can be done when these are the most powerful ones .
here &apos;s a group on the left , in indonesia , called the , which is , but there &apos;s a pretty long time .
more than these other two networks .
and the way they &apos;re doing this is in an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , also , also , also , and combine it in quite a very noisy way .
a group of ankara i met a while ago , which is a little bit of a time , which is a very , very much more like the public , which they would like to learn in college , and they &apos;ve tried to explain what &apos;s going on in college , and they tried to explain what &apos;s going on .
and i have a lecture on the other image in copenhagen in the medical museum in combination with a show to the subject .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s the most likely people , but the only thing that one thing that is actually all united , is this fascination to the technology .
and what you can do with that , and also to the society , and ask the way to do that , and ask , okay , what do you know what you want to do , you have interest with it ?
so , okay , now to treat biology , you need to kind of have material .
you need biological materials , and you need to have tools , and it &apos;s a lab .
or , in fact , what you &apos;re understanding under a lab that &apos;s kind of kind of like a kind of conceptual machines , extremely expensive , extremely , very distant , just for the long-term , trained academics with a ph.d. and so on .
and our approach was just to say , okay , that actually , you don &apos;t have to do that .
this is not necessary because every single one of the people has actually evolved technology as most of the most sophisticated technology that &apos;s really like most of the time .
and the premise with this premise with this premise then , brian mcchrystal &apos;s in england tried to put a team of a team , then a computer company , and then , yes , so , as a result , and then bacteria , and then it &apos;s grown into bacteria , worked .
so every one that &apos;s been a soup of soup that he has left too long , even before .
i &apos;ve tried to do this in my lab , a little bit of turning , and then i put it on ebay , and i &apos;ve been doing a little bit of a little bit of a test analysis , and so , a little bit of a test , so that &apos;s the way that i &apos;m going to do a test , so that &apos;s the way that you can do home .
now , this should actually not be a joke , but it &apos;s not .
here in the picture , you see the lab , in the lab , so it &apos;s a very different garage with the same kind of thing that &apos;s been the university of the college , which has a group of paris , which is a group of paris , and i want to do a very interesting thing , and i want to do a very interesting thing , and i want to do a project that &apos;s really interesting .
and this is a little bit of a , which is just mentioned , and this is what kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a molecular biology .
and yes , so you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively diverse , so there &apos;s a lot of people who do that in home , and so far larger organizations that are going to be able to do more and more of the other things that are going on in the form of time .
but always the approach that it &apos;s just going to be , and it &apos;s supposed to be accessible .
the first project we did as an international group , when we were really aware of ourselves , are okay , there &apos;s now a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we know the people who always are doing this and so forth .
and then , from the most violent website , the founder of the founder , and i said , well , we have to really meet ourselves , also , really , really , really , make a real hit , and then two events , and then , in the most short , in san francisco , and in the san francisco , in san francisco .
and then , because then , yes , yes , who are we , what do we want to do , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values and what are our purposes , our basis ?
and then we &apos;ve got a very big job of this .
that was pretty intuitive , so everyone just has his wishes , his and what it &apos;s going to be , then , then , then .
and i think , i think , a very good code .
and then we have the one that &apos;s not unacceptable , but that &apos;s , i think , i think , has pretty good , that people are quite convinced about this .
and we even tried to do that in the academic world , but it &apos;s kind of not that way .
so i think we &apos;re in the way that we &apos;re in the way that we &apos;re going to have a step further than the academic world .
yeah , what projects do we actually do ?
a project i did with the most popular in switzerland was that we wanted to build a so-called optical event or optical tweezer .
this is when you focus a laser beam on one in the room , you can catch little particles in the air or in the liquid and then move into this focus , so , that &apos;s where a kind of a computer of a matter of principle is basically .
it really works , that &apos;s done in academic science , and we thought , okay , we might have a webcam , then we took a webcam , which is the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , you have a microscope , which is about a microscope .
you see that down there .
and then we have a little bit of a torch , and we got the torch out of the laser and then try to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of it .
so another project that comes from the french group of paris , that &apos;s been done , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and it &apos;s a really , like , a kind of a , such a kind of a , so a little bit of a , so it &apos;s a little bit of a time , so it &apos;s been busy , his favorite , his favorite , his favorite , is sam &apos;s .
he then made this helmet that &apos;s built in cooperation , and in cooperation with the museum , that was walked .
then , there were the visitors in the room , and they put on this chair , put this helmet on .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought or how they thought they were , then they were different lights in the room .
a pretty nice project was quite a very nice project .
another thing from the united states , which is also to do with this kind of thing , is the most prolific , which is the goldilocks , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , to reproduce , to reproduce , to reproduce , to reproduce them , so you can make them visible .
so if i do this , the most popular thing about the crime scene , then you go to collect any of the most sophisticated , and then you do this kind of technique , and then you can say , okay , this hair is hearing this guy , so .
and the machines that do something like this are pretty expensive that you &apos;re buying commercial , the cheapest ones go to the same as a euro .
and that &apos;s not in the middle of the room , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be a lot of .
so this is just a application of many , which you can do with it .
and they have two two builders , and they said , okay , we &apos;re doing easier and cheaper , and then we have open source , so free hardware , so free hardware , and they &apos;re now the cheapest vendor of these devices .
i think somehow six dollars or something like that .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s in a frame of a framework where it &apos;s clearly available .
so it &apos;s a very unfair hack .
a project i started to do was build a computer company .
and the way that you can see , yes , like a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of thing that goes like this , two centimeters or something .
you add a little bit of the street and the most powerful , and then i put the back of the tape , and then i put the light on the onion and then put it on the light .
so the device you see there is not working .
but this is my prototype , but that &apos;s pretty wild , so that &apos;s a branch of a branch that &apos;s on the ground , electronics on it , and it was the pressure , and that was the pressure , and that was the pressure .
and then i took a laser , and i put it on this .
a computer company , if you do the full power with water , has enough pressure , so i think 40 to the bar of the bar is about it .
and then you can speed the particles down enough enough and then go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about a little bit of a euro or something like that , and something like that , the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
and this is the moment that it &apos;s the core of the scene , and that availability of technology to increase , and also increase the information and the information and the most powerful that more people can get involved .
because , as i said , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it , and also not a chance to make it really good .
because if you just read about it , it &apos;s not the same thing as you did , or you &apos;ve seen it .
and i think technology is always becoming more important in our modern societies .
and if you can also make a common citizen in society , and you can make a commitment to the society , and you want to be able to know the access to knowledge and technology .
and you have to do it and understand it , and you can understand it .
and then the most popular open user and citizen science .
so , as citizens , you can get into the situation , just to be able to do this scientific technology .
and that &apos;s the core core of the most basic .
these are the people who have at least officially officially registered on the website , and they &apos;re a website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and interesting is also that they &apos;re also represented in southeast asia .
this is me , that &apos;s there , there are fewer people there than actually exist .
so i know some who don &apos;t have a fit .
and these are just the curvature , the individual people .
in part , with these very , these places , they put together this place .
and that &apos;s very much in the beginning .
and as i said , it &apos;s just started .
and the most important thing , the most popular , because the most popular thing in berlin was the first one , the first one .
and this is a gigantic network now , and it &apos;s been very good , which is all over the world .
and we hope , of course , that we &apos;re going to be similar to ourselves , and then we &apos;re also very good at that , so that it can be more people involved in people .
and i would invite everybody to deal with it and even try to try and try and test it .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not impossible if you have enough curiosity and you &apos;re going to get enough energy , you &apos;re also going to get there .
thank you very much for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hi .
how do we actually work ?
this is a question that i &apos;m very moving to a designer , but also in the realm of the field of the field , and in front of all things in the field of user users .
there &apos;s about how to meet people in interactive media so they can use these interactive media and create them a very much more powerful experience .
because i think that the interactive media in us , cognitive models , are internet models , so paradigm that has been fixed in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we can just generate the only time through interactive media .
and that &apos;s very amazing because you actually believe that these are the most important ones that you &apos;ve been looking at , that you actually get the one in the future , but actually it &apos;s so , the future is exactly what we &apos;re doing in our own root .
what are the most important models of what are happening ?
i &apos;ve been writing four main pieces of email and i want to explain to you a little bit about it .
to be cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we have in the pre-industrial times , which we have in the pre-industrial times .
and to these sorts of things , we heard that we have a natural relationship to virtuality .
that sounds like this , basically , unusual .
but i &apos;m going to go back to this , and i &apos;ll show you a little bit about trial that you have a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second aspect is that since this particular model of education , we &apos;ve been able to be able to talk very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very careful .
and the third area , actually , explains itself .
we all know that the interactive media is definition of definition , which is the denial of the linearity , and of course , what we say is that we &apos;re feeling the linearity today as normal .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of the world &apos;s place .
now , as it is with the mit virtuality , the most natural thing is the world &apos;s most natural thing .
i want to prove you to this .
how many doors have the house where they live ?
we &apos;re not going to answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s happening right now .
they go through the spirit of this house , in the middle of the house , in the middle of the room , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they &apos;re the reality of the reality , and they &apos;re very much without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and there we are going to be struggling for the virtual reality of the virtual reality in our own business , and we can actually do that all the time .
and this is the virtual reality that the virtual reality has to have to be the reality of the world , and the people in the pre-industrial times have to have a lot of time .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any more sophisticated .
they had no mass media .
the only thing that had had was her head .
and in this head , memory was played .
in this head , we know , and with this virtual images , the imagination , the imagination , became also passed up .
and so it &apos;s so strong in us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
the interesting thing about this is when i can make a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s what it is .
the interesting thing about this is that at this time of human beings , the same thing was the same time .
now , if you think about a piece of time .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i &apos;ll talk to you about this again .
the most fundamental tool of the world &apos;s population has been the stories .
and the priest , priests , so-called the name of the day , were extra humble to keep knowledge in stories .
and we also are very , very strong in stories .
the author of the book the chief &apos;s farmer , jonathan , we &apos;re still starting to get a year of the day of stories of stories .
this means for a child that &apos;s spent it until the most of the time of the world &apos;s life , spent most of the time of his life .
now we think our love is about stories that we &apos;ve been sitting on the lap of our parents .
no , no , no , missing .
this is a lot further back , in the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
but for me , in the realm of interactive media as particularly impressive , we have a lot of time to be embedded in our biological memory , the ability to think of the ability to think .
i brought them to an example of the north american tribe of the u.s.
and life lived in the u.s. bank of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very , very crude area , and you had to navigate there , from island to island to get food .
and they did this with so-called the so-called steel system .
you may know that if you &apos;re interested in this , you know , the australian american americans .
they have similar principles .
they have no more sophisticated , but they have used the same as a result of the same , or also the same .
and what the interesting thing about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be mapped over songs .
and with the language that was ordered by the language of the language .
that means you &apos;re going to be talking about sound and rhythm .
and this sounds and this rhythm , the geology , the topography of a region , and that has enabled , of course , that you could get these songs and put it in different ways , and then go back to the left , and then move back to the left and then move back to the left .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to come from a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s happening there ?
it &apos;s that that &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s happened .
we &apos;ve moved to the so-called so-called the so-called &quot; the &quot; in the same way . &quot;
it &apos;s happened , and it &apos;s the book , and it &apos;s the book , and it &apos;s the most important thing .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens , that we have the responsibility for our memories and the own production of our individual memories of the individual media .
on the book and on the picture .
so unfortunately , we have god &apos;s very far to the very far of the day .
virtuality suddenly has become alien for us , and it has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous master company at the university of the day , is so far to say that this mass mass , it means the book and the image , so not television , the internet , and so on , what we call a mass of mass media , and our ability to have our ability to have a mass of mass media .
let &apos;s make a little bit of a little bit of a plastic .
the news machine for the machine machine .
what has the influences on our thinking and our memory system ?
then the main effect of the pre-industrial cultures are the main of the richest cultures .
and they &apos;re going to be more and more of the centuries of the centuries , and more of the things that have been done by the influence of the brain .
that means that instead of remembering us , we have a standard , far common , common patterns of memories that we can depend on our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more ourselves .
we have an abstract language .
we don &apos;t think of the thing anymore in images that are not more in pictures , but we &apos;re going to make them our language .
we &apos;ve used to have things linear .
and we have the linearity as law , and there &apos;s only exceptions , like the most important .
what &apos;s left is the most important thing .
still , we &apos;re the most arrested as a computer designer , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s coming ?
we had the most sophisticated , we had the machine machine , and we &apos;re going to go and go to this so-called so-called the so-called machine .
it sounds very , very much , and it sounds very , very much about science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of the design system that bring us these opportunities back to our skills again .
there &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about the design of the world , it &apos;s about the design of the world .
i want to explain a little bit about this .
there are technical concepts like this , for example , the augmented reality , which means the extended reality .
so if you look at google , for example , then a concept is what the virtual world is doing with the real world , which is our unconscious to the most profound world , which is the virtual than something normal , to feel more natural again .
another example is that the so-called virtual reality is .
so , of course , the way that i hear that is in the context of my talk , because we &apos;re moving into the existing , virtual worlds , all of the way to the model of the brain .
and other examples are the most powerful , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a human being .
all this needs to take our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i &apos;ve been in the end and i hope that video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the most powerful project of michael &apos;s , and the most powerful , the most powerful , and the most powerful , and the most powerful .
and the two of these are also here today .
maybe you can stand up for a minute , so you can talk to the two of the things that you &apos;re talking about .
and this project i brought in as an example of how again , cognitive models are related to this .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
what the most powerful of course , of course , is a computer game .
and if i say computer games , they probably have a very likely to have people who are people who are doing some people who are doing some people who are playing with some of the people who are playing with any other kind of thing .
anyway , they &apos;re doing that in the way .
this is a game for outside .
and that &apos;s what i thought is that i discover the outside world , so i discover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data that we produce is the real world we produce .
i apologize that i have to shrink so much .
you can explain that much better , because there &apos;s more than that .
and it &apos;s about that i &apos;m discovering a city by looking at what was positive or negative .
and so i get a whole different sight of the city , a very different impression , which is , i see negative and positive zones of a city and get a whole different , virtual map of a very real city .
and we can now look at this .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you see right now .
of course , these virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , is clear .
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize my talk , and that &apos;s the way that the qualities and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the most violent , and we &apos;ve gone to the machine that we have a little bit of a little bit of a time , and that we can actually get into our roots , and that we &apos;re going to get to our roots , and we &apos;re actually going to come back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be able to be in you .
i &apos;ve been asked to be a bag of a bag , and i &apos;m going to talk to you about it .
it &apos;s not going to do it .
i &apos;m also going to get the same way to get what &apos;s inside .
but i just do it as a little bit more curious .
yes , kids are curious about nature or should be curious , designers also .
i &apos;m a creator of house , so i &apos;m also involved with the subject of curiosity and how curiosity is also changing our thinking , and why we might be losing curiosity and we need to be a new way of doing it .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re dealing with next to the actual existence of the actual existence .
if professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to be in the n of the n .
and that &apos;s what i had half the year .
a more natural user interface for natural user interface .
now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself why all the designers are going to start with such natural , more natural , more natural , interaction and so on .
and i just think of one of these little devices , because things are always supposed to be more intuitive , always natural , and there &apos;s a look at what &apos;s actually going on for us , of course , what &apos;s really a human , of course , which is a little bit of intuitive or intuitive .
and before the background , i have a natural user interface interface , so the next generation in the process of human computers in the relationship of the human computer is busy busy how our tools or how the computer is changing from the machine to the digital assistant .
so i &apos;ve been busy , when , of course , what or intuitive .
maybe again , a look at it .
why does that happen ?
so if we look at the development of our society , here &apos;s a moment of view , we &apos;re going to move from the third to the fourth , or the fourth of the time .
so from modern in the world .
every society is shaped by a long-term system .
the first thing that the language is about .
that means you &apos;ve found a common language , you could communicate with each other , is in the same cave , or in other areas , has developed cities or villages and has a kind of a turn of the way that it &apos;s created .
the most natural thing was , the language , something very natural , something very natural .
you also had to learn , so no a toddler can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it , and we &apos;re learning it , of course .
that was then harvested by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
that was a computer designer , because of course , the living language started to capture the way that we started in the form of writing , which is what &apos;s called what &apos;s called the most important and alive , and i &apos;m going to start it in stone and so forth .
depending on how i &apos;m going to go and see when i &apos;m a little bit of a , of course , it &apos;s a very different story when there &apos;s a living in a way .
but then , the thing that was going on was that this script was going to be a computer designer , got it .
then the next generation we actually have in the most primarily life .
this is just the pressure of pressure and print with impass and others .
it was just a very , very small , where the victorians , and other people , were saying , are you really crazy when the people start reading , then the next one is , you know , the next thing to be able to do , and that &apos;s completely deadly .
and now we &apos;re going to come into the next generation and the exciting one , so a little bit of a hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this very , very moment , that we &apos;re going to be involved in this in this field of time .
and of course , the confused us , because we see the new media , the new media , the social media , facebook , and so on .
with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what the old thinking is , don &apos;t tell you that in the most violent , and no beef is more or more phenomena , i want to just do that , and i want to do that .
and these two worlds are just going to pop up , new and old thinking .
so the exciting thing about this is , if you look at this , this new society , these new societies , the most powerful , and the principles of the field of influence , and the key paradigm from the most violent .
but now not on local level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the theme of ecology is a global .
not if i think of local organic and the neighbor is less internal , then it doesn &apos;t work all the time .
that means that the local village is actually a global village with the same principles , of course , of course , but also the total transparency .
so as you knew in the village , who has what and when , and when , this is what happens today about this extension of our self through these mobile devices .
it &apos;s that we know global warming and always better and better and better .
it was like it was just on the village .
so , before the background , i just started looking at what &apos;s called what &apos;s going on for us , what &apos;s the point of , what &apos;s the point of that , but what &apos;s the difference for us ?
because often people are coming , they can &apos;t do it , so that everybody can handle it .
so you have to deal with what &apos;s called the , and not just change it , it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s going to be better .
and when it &apos;s also something intuitive , and as i can take as a creator , and as a creator , it &apos;s so much that they &apos;re making a sense of a , so they &apos;re very intuitive , so they &apos;re just fun to use and they &apos;re just using it .
you &apos;re doing it , even during the study of perception and the subject of perception .
and that &apos;s , of course , what you &apos;re going to start and look and look and say , okay , now i just look at the inside of the inner self .
and what &apos;s it like in this ?
so how do we work when we &apos;re going to get there ?
and what does it mean , of course , intuitive and how do our channels work in perception and how works the cognitive process ?
because steve jobs said you &apos;re going to dig up to dig up to dig it up .
so you really have to look at the details , if i want to make something more intuitive or intuitive , which is what it means in the core .
and there &apos;s a lot of our seven senses that most of us think we have only five , now , now , there &apos;s seven , there &apos;s still seven , there &apos;s still the next , eighth sense , and as an extension of our self , again , and then we &apos;re going to be able to do it again .
and to look at how we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that is a difference .
many use the word , but not what it means to be a detail .
but i have to understand in the core , understanding when information is information , when information is information , and from information , so i know how to do things , i know , as i can , after course , as well as i can do things .
and of course , how design influence is the perception .
we see this , if i make things , then i can make them confusing how to do it on the right , where i don &apos;t know what is salt and pepper , or i can make it intuitive , by showing things .
so much natural , in a head , but i look at the same , where is salt and pepper .
and if i tell someone , i give you salt or pepper , then he &apos;ll be thinking about where it is in the right .
and the left just intuitively access and then hopefully , that no sugar is in there , the salt just gives you a bit of salt .
but also our perception itself , how does it cause us .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the little , although it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just the same big , and yet our perception is changing , depending on what context we do .
anybody know what that is ?
come on .
and the main thing is that it should work .
there &apos;s a little bit more to my glasses .
so it &apos;s n .
a second circle starts to be able to fit certain resemblance or associate .
and if i look at a more powerful , and then we don &apos;t see a unit of a unit , which is , circle , circle and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle , a different circle .
this is what you call the most powerful or just a little bit of the way that we &apos;re in perception .
so , for the creator , the most important semester , the great semester , the great ted system .
so , the middle of the continuity , the continuity of the continuity and so on .
and then , in the third , again , forget .
but this is essential to a key component , if you want to design things in the same way as well as you can .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting , is that .
sounds very banal , but it &apos;s very exciting to be very excited about it .
so we have the eyes , and now you think we &apos;re looking at the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you can see from the back to the front .
because they &apos;re a assumption to the front that they see something they recognize , the circle of the circle .
that means we &apos;re only seeing our vision before we see it , and then we see it back to our own online system , to say , okay , okay , okay .
i have such cognitive cognitive systems , you have what you want to see .
and that &apos;s then there , that &apos;s coming back .
then again , it goes back to the front , because the back of the back is not going to go back and say , well , look at it , and sure , if you look at what you see , that &apos;s what you want to see .
and then again , it &apos;s going back to the back and then it &apos;s just seen .
so a very , very , very , very , very , very , very different process , and what &apos;s going on for the things that are happening .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s familiar with this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve described .
now , everyone &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
does anybody see something a little bit ?
a very , very , very simple one .
if i saw that , that &apos;s a computer that &apos;s in there , then you know that .
they &apos;re never going to forget anymore because i &apos;m going to show you where the most popular thing is .
now you see the most powerful .
and on , you &apos;re going to see it always .
so , i actually have to get them to actually be able to see that they don &apos;t recognize any pattern , but i have them in a very short time , and i &apos;ve been able to see this dog in a very short time .
and this is the projection of view , and it &apos;s a projection , you see , look .
now i know , and now i &apos;m going to go back to the front of the day that i see the most powerful .
i see the most powerful .
so , very exciting processes that then , in this , yes , gray is actually not , but here in this particular crowd , it &apos;s just just going to work on this .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know something three seconds , until i kind of look at the present , i can also bridge very well , and i can also bridge it very well in the way that i &apos;m doing it by three seconds .
it &apos;s just to process it as a present .
then it goes into the past and so i can bridge very elegant , for example , when i know this phenomenon .
what does the math take down milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time that you fall in love .
that means , if you know that , you know , if you look at who you look like , because i don &apos;t take a gun for what you can do , you can &apos;t get a gun for what you can do .
and 16 milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time of most perceptions that we have .
that &apos;s what happens to this first impression in a rapidly fast speed , as we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at and how we &apos;re going to protect ourselves against our environment , so we can think about it as well .
of course , the creator of the world is not just the perceptions of perceptions and neural activity , but primarily , of course , with the subject of the world &apos;s subject .
so , like a human being , a human being is about things .
there &apos;s a time that &apos;s practical , so that &apos;s the practical features or the other things that are happening .
there are a lot of time where i know exactly where i have to get to the grasp .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why is there any such thing for a small , small , little bit of money , where no matter what &apos;s going on , so that it &apos;s not so practical ?
we &apos;re more likely to be on the symbolic , on the top of the world that we &apos;re also dealing with as a creator .
back to my actual topic of natural user interface and the subject , which of course is also a lot of the time , is the most important thing .
and the thing that is , i think , is how to get a certain goal , or how can a user be able to get a certain degree of a certain , efficient and more effective , and then the goal of the goal is to achieve .
so it &apos;s more like the norm .
how do i make something more like this ?
i can use that directly or need to be the n , or i need to have a lot of training for it .
and less of the time , or a little bit of the time , it &apos;s .
that i just make that differently and make beautiful , is not that it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that too .
and then if you &apos;re in part of the software that we &apos;ve seen , you &apos;ll see , then you &apos;ll understand why 99 percent of our software is a little intuitive or not on the surface of the software , which is a lot of intuitive , and it &apos;s not embedded in a lot of the way that it &apos;s a classic software .
and so , intuitive , intuitive , is not just a fundamental climate crisis , and a fundamental climate system , if i want to use technology to use the people &apos;s devices .
why ?
because in the rule of the new species of the world , the natural user is going to be five times more quickly in the average of our goal .
you have to imagine that if you do something of the classical , five hours , and you need to take a little bit of the kind of natural software , just a hour of the natural software .
it doesn &apos;t mean that you can probably go home four hours , but your employer or somebody will fall , you know , how he &apos;s busy doing it with the four hours .
but i want to say that it &apos;s a very , of course , a very small thing to do , and also to make certain things .
and then if we go back to the software of software , this is the first one of the first , the first ever abstract line , which was very abstract , where you needed months to deal with these systems .
then the next one , the next thing that we &apos;ve been doing with the studio , or mental model , is the software that &apos;s going to be working on , which is , you have a idea of something that &apos;s metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop to make the computer useful .
so no longer zeros and ones or the ones , but just a metaphor .
it &apos;s been a lot of the time that it &apos;s been happening , but it &apos;s also much better .
the next generation of graphics is working very much more with behavior .
so i &apos;m designing as a creator , as a creator , as a lot of the behavior .
this is also a paradigm paradigm .
that i &apos;m going to look at that , and that &apos;s the case of success , just the most successful one .
and if i &apos;m going to go to this natural user , in these natural users , where i &apos;m in voice , by language , by the touch , by the gesture , and no longer a mouse , and the things that have to control things , i &apos;m still faster and more .
but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do again , when the things are going to be more intuitive ?
if you &apos;re more intuitive and then i have to be trained to see my little friend here , and see what does it mean for the point of view of the brain &apos;s point when it &apos;s really something intuitive ?
and that &apos;s for us people &apos;s always intuitive , if i have to think about it very little .
so it doesn &apos;t seem to be like , but it &apos;s just going to be true .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for designers ?
that means that we can transmit existing growth of a little bit of a different way to put the metaphor , for example , the metaphor , i can do that as a creator .
that means i can just transmit a intuitive , human health system on a software and make the software much more powerful .
and of course , the question is , what is the most important thing that &apos;s going on from us , and now i &apos;ve already said it .
this is called the so-called the name of the world .
and this is using each of us and the most dynamic , and it &apos;s an acronym , and it stands for orient , more powerful , more powerful , more educated .
this is what everybody &apos;s doing is the whole time , but it &apos;s kind of unconscious and yes , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive or partly .
the model is already going to be in the womb and is a lot of the time , so it works in the world at young and old , and it &apos;s used by us all the time without that most of the time that this model is there .
and the most important thing about it is about 50 to a half to the time of the time , so in sleep , you &apos;ve noticed that it &apos;s less often more often than the day .
i can now orient this mental pulse of mental energy , and i can get to a more powerful , venture , venture technology , on a computer level .
and through these kinds of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the internet , but now not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a design of a brain , a laser , a laser .
and this is on a higher grail of the world &apos;s transmission as the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the most prolific .
and if i &apos;m going to go to the ted , for example , in the case of the head of the book , as a choice , i &apos;m going to be able to look at it , i can see it &apos;s big to me , and i can see it in the details , and i can go to the same , and i can send it to someone else , and go to your shop and go to your sleep .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to do this by an example .
it &apos;s just a cake that everybody has eaten .
in the case , i use this kind of object , and i can zoom back again , zoom back .
i &apos;ll get the whole picture of this , now filter , and can tell me just all of the things that chocolate is for for example .
and once a interface , what &apos;s much more intuitive and much more natural .
because , because i can grab the things like the bits , and they can come to me , is much natural than if it &apos;s about hierarchical organized websites or other mechanisms , or other mechanisms , that can make these things available .
imagination is more of the more powerful , and with this sentence , i like to close , a and again , to give designers think , also , designers have to think differently to come to new solutions , and thank you very much for your attention and please .
i want to help you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first thing you &apos;re going to be as a child is that you &apos;re going to take care of what the most important you have , you know , and depending on whether your parents have allowed you to play more or less in the middle of your parents , and the more , you know , will be the curiosity , of course , the more , you know , your curiosity .
and curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
so , all of that is , these are , and they &apos;re curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m now about this , basically , this whole whole whole whole , more sophisticated , 40 years of power , in quality of the quality .
and there &apos;s a central point in this .
and it depends on phosphorus .
give a chance to give you a chance .
every day you give them a + scale about two grams of phosphorus , and every day you have to take two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only glide as a chemist of the most pessimistic .
if we did not take phosphorus , and we &apos;re going to get to it .
amazingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re here to deal with something , which is actually the case , but not that .
because all of the time talking about energy , but nobody talks about the most important .
the most critical thing is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have two years of phosphorus and already now through the world &apos;s most much more uranium in the world than being used in all the nuclear plants .
in the last 20 years , the most recent tons of uranium has been distributed in our fields in germany .
and we take it all up .
it makes leukemia at children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , the environment , drive less car .
the environment , make less waste .
the environment , the environment , fewer energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
this is like when i say , you know , your child , you just blow it three times instead of five times .
this is just a little less destruction .
if we think about the womb , we &apos;re going to be our whole earth sooner or later , our whole planet will be a cemetery .
so , that &apos;s the womb to think about the oven .
and the most important thing about this is to look at the soil as first .
in the ground , over 60 percent of the world &apos;s population is stored .
now , we &apos;re building corn and losing corn between 11 and 30 kilograms per hectare , or on the square square meter .
that means we &apos;re losing about five times more than a new one , as new as it is .
we can actually look at the most important thing .
and everything is packaging or content .
for example , in the most violent 20 percent of the world &apos;s population , the most prolific one of the arable people in the world are now .
and because we &apos;re getting older , the self-transcendence will be bigger .
it &apos;s kind of like all of you in the world &apos;s office .
yes ?
one baby needs about six hundred megatons .
we could of course reduce that 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is going to be balanced in china in a second .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go with these biospheres ?
here &apos;s one of the proof that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is being emitted by the pigs in the pigs .
people over the urine .
yes .
so , you can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what &apos;s happening with it , right ?
traditionally , we think in the world &apos;s office , we &apos;re too many on the world .
and if you &apos;re the people who are going to be able to do it , if you say that , you would be better , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re going to be able to be hostile and hostile .
and so someone like al gore says one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more powerful than the human population to stabilize .
in israel , you say , if you &apos;re a human being , you &apos;re going to be the earth .
here it says , the more you &apos;re going to be more restrained , the better .
yes .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh about four times more than we humans .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , nobody like termites , in so far , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means that the ants weigh much more than we .
and because they &apos;re physically working much harder than we and because they only live three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in the energy consumption , something 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you see how far we &apos;re going to get away , what really we wanted to do , and how sad we are , we can see that we &apos;re at all on earth , you can see that for example , a program has a program to be there , right ?
you can only be a little bit more like you , if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
did you see a tree tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be misha than trees , yes ?
yes ?
no tree is a tree .
luckily , not , yes ?
there &apos;s no more sophisticated trees .
there &apos;s still six billion trees in the lagos sea .
you &apos;ve heard about it , you know , a little bit of trees from trees ?
that means all of our intelligence means that we want to be a little misha than trees .
and where you see , even in something like diane , the most violent biological yes , it doesn &apos;t allow us to go back our own business .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go back into the cycles .
and so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s alone .
that &apos;s what we feel so guilty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no more a marketing , no more , no , no , no , no , no , no , the way that we &apos;re going to go back to our own poo .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , which is oil oil .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , it &apos;s the highest , not to be there ?
so , yes , yes ?
you can only have a little bit of time when you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot yourself , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can take our nutrients back .
we &apos;re doing agriculture in brazil where we go back to the nutrients .
right , we can actually put nutrients in agriculture in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china for example , where we take the waste of it .
in china , a more powerful one is still a more powerful , kind of , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid , our nutrients .
that means that the western western media is going to be made by the city , but the farmers never have a little bit of time .
and so , the cities had to grow more and more , because the farmers in the cities had to go and keep the cities on the city .
so all of the western rich rich are always expanding until they don &apos;t have the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re in the end of the world .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done a lot of the time of five thousand years , because you &apos;ve been able to make nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat in china , you would expect to stay in china as long as you &apos;re looking at the toilet .
because it &apos;s an animated , and the nutrients will take .
you &apos;ve got them to eat them , not to the food system .
that means you can see the internet , as you can get back to the nutrients .
this is actually beautiful , if you do that , so agriculture is generating , and it &apos;s produced by a hectare of a country with five thousand people in favelas , and it can be a farmer , and the plant and the shark and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish and the fish .
and the great thing about this is that the most important thing in the favelas is about 90 percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people , so far bad .
we can support them , to be good .
this is of course , of course , but the facilities are carrying themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by design , which is a farmer that can just drive them .
that means that the most important thing is going back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve now built over the last 20 years , not by these facilities ever have been seen .
you could just be able to get a liter of a liter of water and then the plant would be ruined over years .
don &apos;t find instead .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people , so far bad .
we can support them , to be good .
that means we need to have phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you &apos;re going to be able to write in germany , in germany , the best of all the available parts of the treatment .
unfortunately , not in the middle of the world , but maybe you can help the most expensive thing to do .
because the most important facility could be the phosphorus back .
and that has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s really possible .
we &apos;ve been using it over three years now .
the dutch government has explained , you &apos;ll be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need it all .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of plastic types .
these are the countries that are controlling 40 percent of the oil systems .
and the oil is going to replace us by other energy fuel .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace you .
so it &apos;s not about making the existing one little less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s especially asking to ask what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
in holland , you understand that , of course , because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if you &apos;re sad for example , if you &apos;re upset with her , if you were upset , and you come with 50 horsepower .
very inefficient .
but really , really , yes ?
or take a snapshot .
a woman in germany eats about six kilograms of three kilograms of her life .
it &apos;s .
this is not exactly the scientific thing , because because we don &apos;t know how much more powerful is going to be .
but a random , even at that lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but really , really , right ?
it &apos;s a whole thing that &apos;s beautiful in life , not efficient .
that &apos;s not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask , what is the right ?
not to burn the world &apos;s energy , and it &apos;s a little bit better to lose and lose it in the world &apos;s surface , and to lose the whole materials for the cycles of cycles , but first of all , how do you make the cycles ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i put them on dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with a little bit of water and a glass of water .
wonderful , &quot; ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything in life counts , not to save it , to avoid reducing .
all the most sophisticated .
we say the people , oh , you don &apos;t have green in the south .
no , it &apos;s just the right thing that &apos;s right , right ?
in every place where you &apos;re going to be , you know , you &apos;re going to get back to the world .
but the wrong things .
if you &apos;re going to get the wrong things , you have a more powerful one .
in how we think about north .
there &apos;s any footprint there .
if you walk , yes , everybody destroyed the ground .
because the soil is going to die , the mosses are dying and the wind and the water is turning away the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water is longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that is going to be a marsh .
not a lot of it .
we &apos;re going to say sustainability .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how do you do this with your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; yeah ?
this is the minimum line .
so not saving , prevent , avoid .
every waste is essential .
and it &apos;s a lust when you see in italy , like people in the high bow , like the people in the high bow , they &apos;re going to get out of coke .
because you know , this is a kind of a transformative process .
it &apos;s a form of design , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
we &apos;ve developed a design system , for example , that &apos;s in room temperature , which is liquid .
you can throw it off where you go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re building all over the place .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they &apos;re going to take away from the biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so it &apos;s two cycles .
not all of it should be the regulation of the brush .
a television or a washing machine , which you use , you don &apos;t use it .
just the things that the most important , like the design , like the way that you have , like the design , you have to be in biological systems .
things that are used only to go in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the most important thing , yes ?
so , direct advertising , and not for the company , in the company , it &apos;s not for a se , but that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing now that they &apos;re helping this company to make these products successfully .
because we don &apos;t do things more free .
yes ?
so , if i &apos;m going to eat them , and say , that &apos;s free of the food , then it &apos;s not going to help you .
no , we &apos;re stuck in what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like the math .
not toxic .
but everything in it is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can get down the water of the mountain , and go down the rubber in biological circuits , right ?
everything is a scourge of it .
and if it &apos;s possible , of course , we can do it for the diagnosis of nike , for nike , for the whole industry and the whole industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the world &apos;s population that causes the textile industry .
so , you &apos;re helping to ask , you know , you &apos;re asking people to go .
hey , puma , does you really make your real serious ?
because they &apos;ve been changing twice the way that they have .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really do it .
so , let me give you a little bit of this .
but it &apos;s .
yes .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been presented .
that &apos;s what it is .
we can now do things like this , if you break , if you break , you can put it in biological circuits .
technical cycles are just as much .
there &apos;s a direct principle of this .
this is the first green backpack , actually , which is made to go back into the cycle .
so , in every store , you can do things like this .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the e.u. ?
if it &apos;s the waste right now .
all of these biospheres are around , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there &apos;s on the front of the street , but also in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastics , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the most sophisticated , you can just go back to the surface of the world , you can get a baby in israel , or tunisia , in tunisia .
yes ?
if you take these these brushes , you &apos;re flashing , you &apos;re flashing , interactively and the powder to plant trees .
so this is the baby &apos;s baby for all life , and it &apos;s already beginning to be .
so , we don &apos;t need to be more inclusive , we can be more nuanced .
it &apos;s kind of a secret print .
yeah , so , sort of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything else .
i started a institute .
now , there are many people working with and they can all be engaged .
there &apos;s extra a company to do it , where everybody can join .
so not saving , stop , avoid , reduce , no more , no more , but smart waste .
does it make you curious ?
thank you .
the work of the design .
music as language .
in the description of my talk , i wrote that i was as a computer designer , as a computer designer , so in english , in english , understanding .
and the language of the written notes are a popular notes in a very careful music .
that you can &apos;t just fix the word for word the text in another language , but also the deeper sense of words and the deeper sense of words , so that it has to make a meaningful translation , everybody who has to do it with a long-term translation .
now , to translate from german to english , more knowledge can require more knowledge , and it &apos;s more likely to be about poetry or even poetry .
but it &apos;s very alien for what we do with the musicians who do our own business .
as a result of a computer , i first got the written notes .
you think that the composer in the notes has just all the time that he imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and alert .
these notes are about the same or not , like a verbal verbal , as well as a verbal type of view , a landscape .
because in this verbal verbal knee , the smell of flowers don &apos;t smell the level of the flowers , the degree of the brain &apos;s disease , not to hear the most powerful thing that &apos;s not going to be .
that means the interpreter needs to be able to put this in the world &apos;s data , which is a different , concrete , non-verbal , non-verbal , non-verbal , non-verbal .
today i want to tell you what i &apos;m doing , so i &apos;m going to translate a musical language , so that &apos;s a verbal language .
so basically a translation of translation .
so i &apos;m going to put it on the whole thing that i &apos;d rather like to do , because if i had to translate it to english , it would be for me to be the translation of translation of translation .
so the music works for me as much as the spoken language .
the main notes have the function of the letters of a script .
so it &apos;s not going to be just reading grades and the keys to get the keys on the piano or the right place on a computer level .
because that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the point of the letters is , you know , when you can do the language .
so , for the learning process , you need to have the music process at least as long as spoken language .
there &apos;s also a bit of speculation , whether you learn it for the most important , just passive or you can also talk to the musical speaker .
the work of the design of the world &apos;s work starts like a kind of a computer .
after first , you &apos;ve chosen a piece of play because you &apos;re excited about the origin of the composition of the composition .
you accumulate information about the piece of the play .
you read in the letters , you &apos;re reading notes , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts of the composers themselves .
you study the works that he &apos;s written before and after .
you compare to comparison .
the motives , it &apos;s to write .
how and what does he feel ?
how were his circumstances , how the society and politics ?
all of this is interested in me .
you think in this time , in the way you look at the most contemporary images , or you &apos;re reading literature .
but the time you have a role of the world , but as an interpreter , you have a rich knowledge to play the composers , and it &apos;s always easier to feel in it and feel it .
the composer will always be more to the friend that you live with .
his cause to write the piece is always more and more to my personal concerns , to play it .
now , the notes all the other things that the philosopher is doing is a very precise record of the composers , but just a framework , i &apos;m now going to turn this scaffold to the point of meaning and meaning to the meaning of it .
i then say to my own words , which could be written between this framework .
i play the same thing that might have these notes .
now for me , and for the composers , and what they might mean for him today .
every note , every phrase gets a sense of it because i feel it , because it comes from my own now , because it comes from my own now .
it has to be in this and now , i &apos;m going to be able to convince my audience to not convince my audience that this is my cause .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , and if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve been able to have so long in advance , how new to experience .
and as you &apos;ve been able to have a happy new day , even though it &apos;s all the same rituals of life , you get up , breakfast , to work , and i &apos;ll go to the same piece of time , and i &apos;ll always get the same piece back to the new .
i &apos;ve become older again , the seasons change , my pulse goes down at night when the morning takes it , in a auditorium , it takes longer to return to the sound .
i &apos;m going to breathe the audience , consciously , or unconsciously .
all of this is affecting me and all this influenced my experience with the composition .
so , it &apos;s also wonderful , if i stand with a computer party on the stage and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , more satisfying conversation .
you get a new idea in and it &apos;s going to be answered with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting because things that we haven &apos;t practiced , and what you can &apos;t do is that you can &apos;t do that .
it makes great fun to make music , and you &apos;ve seen the audience , and then you &apos;ve experienced the music .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play so much as in this moment .
i can &apos;t play as much as in 20 years .
i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today and i &apos;m going to have a lot more of the way that i &apos;m going to have a lot more of the time , and so on , emotions and emotions have been more than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some of the most powerful things , but for new entrepreneurial devices .
have a nice physical example of this .
it was on a street party for the most successful old teachers , professor , professor , a famous master professor , a famous scientist , a famous professor , and a long professor of the world &apos;s chief here in the world .
unfortunately , i was too young , so he was a lot of time , so i started studying .
but i had the great fortune , very early , with 13 years , and i was to meet my school in school .
i was 17 , when i went back to one of his courses , and i played the last one of the four bond of chopin , a computer company .
he asked me what the introduction of this kind of thing was for me .
this is a very , very small part .
and in my favorite book , i said , expectation .
he &apos;s going to be and said , &quot; so ?
this must be the most important thing .
because for me , she means memory .
he was over 60 .
well , with 17 , you just have dreams , but not a major memories .
i play the piece of all the years , and i &apos;ve been able to have it , even though it has changed , even though no single note has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , i &apos;m going to read something new .
one example of this is a very different area . prints made the most powerful .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different day , in the same time , in the light of light .
he &apos;s translated the most sophisticated , translated to the way he saw it , like she looked at him in this moment .
his personal health system of the world &apos;s personal .
the most elegant interpretation of a piece is comparable .
now , i &apos;ve also been older than chopin , as he wrote the piece of the piece .
he was just living in the last few years .
and it &apos;s important to me , again , to look at the notes , even though i mean , you can memorize it .
to keep the same thing , right with the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially if he died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said yes , you need about the same as long as spoken language .
often the most important thing is that you &apos;re learning the notes .
you &apos;re learning basically reading the reading before you just talk one word .
you learn to find the notes on the notes on the instrument .
if all the fingers in time and right , as it is in the notes , they come out , then they come out of sound that sounds like music .
if that happens the correct student , the students get the most expensive piece .
it &apos;s hardly spoken in the middle of the brain .
well , there &apos;s a very quick piece of time on the front , which is a quick piece .
it &apos;s slow , slowly .
and loud , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s most of the time .
but even if you &apos;re going to take this data , it still stays something technical .
and it &apos;s still not a interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something very much about .
because , to make music on the instrument , the way that you can do it is to be there , and you should feel there before .
that &apos;s what singing .
a child who didn &apos;t learn that , because it doesn &apos;t have the parents , it &apos;s not going to do it by itself .
this is like the most cosmopolitan .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music to then make it over another possibility , so to make a sound , to sound .
people who never sing , have never felt immediately with their body , like it &apos;s , to form a sound .
a phrase with his own breath .
because the music instrument is the extension of our body .
our vocal vocal vocal to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the main line of the piano is the sequel of my fingers .
the tune comes from the most violent and the rhythm from the dance .
the continual health system today is not being an inherent thing .
you don &apos;t need to make music even more , if it becomes boring .
no longer necessary to whistle a car , or singing .
every single music is going to be flawed when you &apos;re constantly going to be able to get music out of the outside .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t sing ?
i &apos;m not going to sing , you can &apos;t sing , a , because you believe you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to start to figure out whether they can &apos;t , or learn how to do these little muscles that are going to hire the vocal chords , right .
because you can train .
or c , because you have it , you &apos;re going to be a little bit of time .
i wonder how to do this diagnosis of the persistent ?
have you got a more powerful or a computer company , how do you say it today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and you don &apos;t want to have any failure to do that .
but what i would do is , i think , because music is a beautiful , more powerful thing .
but maybe you can also even even get it more .
well , you see , all of the time , nobody has to be a single candidate .
but say , please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand the classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i said , but surely you can say , you know , it &apos;s like you like or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says , &quot; i don &apos;t know if i don &apos;t touch it , because i can &apos;t cook . &quot;
so , they don &apos;t get to eat , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to get rid of classical music because you don &apos;t play a instrument .
listen to it , and say , if it tastes you or not .
whether the music is to give you too sweet or too sweet .
tell that what you feel .
and the time you get , you know , also , and you want to get some more spices there , or taste some more spices .
now why am i asking my audience to be able to listen to it ?
because the music is a language , and a language is to communicate .
a piece of artwork you never look at has no force to work .
the food that was a chef , or a chef , was a cook , and not just looked at the recipes , and not just look or recipes .
so please listen to , if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice thing .
if in a environment where the adults are doing music , or at least , listen to music , a child is growing up , and then it &apos;s very easy to ask a child , to ask , what color has your flower ?
can you now play me in blue ?
and the child plays , after a computer , instead of a red flower , a blue flower .
and this sounds very different than before .
and that was the first beginning of a personal expression of a personal expression .
so the first step to a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece of play today , which was originally written a hundred , two or two years ago ?
now , the instruments have moved .
there was a little bit of the piano at the time called the instrument .
it was not invented yet .
i think the stream would have been excited if he had the distinction of the modern possibilities of modern technology .
i can now have the most popular , which had the stream that the stream has made on the modern wing , which is not a matter of a computer .
and also , from beethoven , you know that he heard more than he had been deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that has a orchestra from the back of the back as a result .
so the composers are dependent on us , which is the pieces that are reinventing the pieces .
so they &apos;re going to put them up , which they just dreamed of in the spirit .
and also , what you would think of today in the spirit .
or what i &apos;m going to do today , because what you thought might have been .
thank you .
you know what &apos;s envy ?
were they once jealous ?
and how did that feel ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a car .
when i come to my little v , i &apos;m going to go and get it wrong , and i &apos;m going to get this feeling .
i &apos;m going to take something through the head .
i say , &quot; well , what do you need to do great car ? &quot;
that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be the first year that half of his value is .
and at all , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to afford to do this little car ?
and then i immediately fall , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this awkward feeling is gone .
our organism has invented a great way to make such awkward feelings like envy .
you can try that with words like revenge or a little bit of a mess or a mess .
i want to explain to you something today , or something that is wrong with you , which is probably familiar with you .
the mechanism comes from the lie .
but think about the lie of how you may have heard them , if people say , nobody has the intention to build a wall .
and then rocks , so he &apos;s going to get the point off .
and you see , in a lie , you see that the liars don &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to check out that it has a very different sense of it .
it &apos;s just it makes you think , not yourself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , that i &apos;m talking about , that they deceive themselves .
they need this lie to get a more powerful , to get a self-deception .
you can make less easy , yes , or also , to get down .
they need time .
and this time , an anecdote talks about you maybe .
the spanish painter , picasso once has a woman , a woman .
and this woman was complaining about it , the portrait would not see her .
picasso says , wait only .
it &apos;s always going to be more similar .
and at that point , and if you laugh , you realize how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience something that artists can tell us very well .
because artists have a high school relationship to the lie .
the artist tells you something , and especially this lady , what you don &apos;t see when you just look at the mirror .
the artist tells you something like this , with a portrait of what you &apos;re going to be familiar with when you look at this artwork .
then this awkward feeling , it could not be seen , and it will always be more similar to you .
here you have this mechanism that we can use as a great invention to the lie of our online system .
and not only in art , in the middle of the mythology , in the mythology , in stories , it &apos;s coming back .
you may know this idea of the lady , which looked at every morning in the mirror and asked him who is the most beautiful in the entire country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a more powerful one .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this true , even the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this true guarantee .
but we should just be familiar with that , that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a little bit different in a different way .
here it is necessary to understand what we &apos;re understanding under the world &apos;s surface , again .
we need this lie that we need to take the deception to the end of the world without the rest of us .
we don &apos;t just have in art , in the world &apos;s science , but also in science such as great lies .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s wife &apos;s wife .
she heard about this book from charles darwin , the emergence of the species and the blood workers .
that the man from the monkey was supposed to be , and , yes , there would be a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then they ran them up to her husband and said , &quot; well , that &apos;s not true , &quot; which charles writes .
the human being is supposed to have the monkeys or a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , we need to prevent people &apos;s knowledge .
why do we have to prevent people from something to get out of something if it &apos;s true ?
because we cannot live without these kinds of things .
because we &apos;re this self-deception , this feeling , great to be , of the highest creatures , not from one such kind of thing , from such a kind of a kind of a kind of organism , which is a little bit more like a organism that exists in the way that things that are in the world .
so , we can &apos;t even admit these things .
we need to prevent people from things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you can see how slowly this mechanism is drifting up and how the traces look , which he leaves , which leads to something else than on this great picture of ourselves , i want to illustrate another story .
a particularly beautiful story , like i &apos;m my .
my wife told me she was .
she came from school , she &apos;s a teacher , she &apos;s told her about a student .
a student student .
it likes to be particularly like it , because he has a tendency to blow up .
and she asked him what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire fire .
and because i &apos;m at the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in the same thing .
yes , you feel it , if you suck up at this point , there &apos;s something wrong .
i said , i &apos;ve always said , if a human being in a moral way , the most important thing is , because it &apos;s used , we should try to replace it through the most important , although to replace it .
and then you &apos;ll see that and then you experience the sentence .
although i &apos;m at the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in the same thing .
they feel that this is the real truth behind the handle .
so a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a sudden that &apos;s interested in the world &apos;s disease .
it &apos;s interested in the long-term movement .
but there are no clubs that we can see where we can learn how to do fire .
there &apos;s only the second second , the fire fire .
he signed up .
and you can &apos;t tell your teacher , you don &apos;t like to put it in fire somewhere , and you &apos;re happy to put yourself in the fire .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re involved in the dangers of being able to get the risks that are only going to be able to do fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this one of these is that the most important thing that we knew in the heart of the brain is that he actually was related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t tell the fire .
here you have this kind of carbon game between the unconscious and the conscious , which immediately jumps out , without that you can do something about it , and the things that you know is that you can look very different for them and others .
so just that kind of words that we &apos;re using in the language of the political correct debate is going to be used again .
we actually know that something else is the case .
but we know if we &apos;re the saying that we &apos;re going to be very sensitive to the social history .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to do things like this in a society that should work .
so i want to tell you what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
after what logic , these self-deception , the willingness to be a different reality than the ones we actually know in the unconscious knowledge that they &apos;re actually being able to spread out .
so i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is , what many of you know and some of you appreciate , very few of you don &apos;t need to have anything .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is something that is intellectual , says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not about stop , physical nature .
and if you have people who are the solid belief , they have a soul , or you can also say that they have been brought to life , then they have been asking that the soul is so much about the way the soul is , they &apos;re not from matter , and they &apos;re just dead , and they &apos;re just dead , and they &apos;re just dead , and they &apos;re just dead , and they &apos;re dead , and they &apos;re dead .
and from that soul , you think that somehow you kind of in this cloudy nature , in this particular , nature , it &apos;s called the latin , the most prolific , present , present .
and then when this kind of thing happens to people , then he &apos;s filled with dignity , with mind , with nature , with nature , that can only live , yes with soul .
and then he can just get a little bit of time .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so she &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we should be able to perceive them as something that &apos;s really going to be present for our lives .
and if you have this premise , you understand the logic that we &apos;re experiencing , with a lie that we &apos;re fortunate to do with a lie of our world .
because now you can apply a solar system .
you know , you know , you know , you know , the school .
now this is a video of a computer that describes us a logic .
this is the hardest part of my talk .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
because to lie that you can just apply this logic wrong .
in this particular field , three sentences come .
the first sentence is , you know , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if you have a right , it &apos;s not a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i particularly particularly particularly particularly in him .
a third sentence , which is immediately coming up with people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul who &apos;s dead , and it can &apos;t say anything .
and you feel that .
here &apos;s the logic in this , yes , in this particular talk , to the expression .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , which are logical .
i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a claim about reality .
i can say the most powerful is a man .
and if i have right , the most powerful one is a man .
if i don &apos;t have a right , the most powerful one is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but the key thing is , if i have right , it &apos;s just true .
so if you &apos;re a little bit of a game , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he didn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical .
and now our consciousness is feeling immediately , and it can do something .
it &apos;s a third sentence that doesn &apos;t have to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s what the opposite of the first sentence is already proven and understandable .
because actually , we have to prove whether there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that just uses it , two sentences are correct , and a third of the way that it looks like he would have something to do with it , so we can save our own business .
so , we &apos;re doing this as if it &apos;s actually impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue to continue these things in different examples .
in the present , we have a very modern example of the world that &apos;s going to fill back the world &apos;s population .
you have to think about this another philosophical topic , a more powerful thing , a mind .
that &apos;s what we have to do in the south century .
there was a scholars who was called johannes , and after that , the most terrifying named the most terrifying .
the most profound is a very narrow , which is a pure nature .
it &apos;s not that soul .
this is a kind of a business system .
and if you place exactly the exact middle of the middle between two , it &apos;s going to be a place .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a haystack he should go first .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
so the most popular thing is that the main organization is introduced .
and the forces with the internet use of the other is to solve each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
only if you take another example , so if you &apos;re going to make a haystack bigger , it doesn &apos;t need any reason and it doesn &apos;t need anything to do .
it &apos;s automatically going to be the right thought .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re kind of driven in nature , you &apos;re going to be driven by the larger pile that you &apos;re carrying immediately , you also have the feeling that you have to give it a free will .
and if we &apos;re in the middle of the street , i remember the most functional for brain science .
there &apos;s a scholars who &apos;s called wolf , and it &apos;s sometimes telling you , wolf , and you sometimes say , wolf , there &apos;s no free free .
now we can make the second sentence , and we can say , if wolf &apos;s right , he &apos;s got no free free .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can read almost every day in the daily newspaper , which is what you find in this third sentence .
and it looks like this , who doesn &apos;t have free free , can &apos;t be pulled for his actions and claims to responsibility and he &apos;s so versatile .
and you have it again .
you actually have to prove to you if there &apos;s something like free free .
but the logic of deception allows us to do so as if the first sentence of the first wrong thing is , when you have to take the opposite , you know , the opposite of it .
and now you can just do something if you want to do anything , if you want to test anything and you &apos;re going to be happy , if you want to make people happy , this courage to practice .
so , practice that for example , if you &apos;re a person who you can tell , there &apos;s no more appropriate .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for the world &apos;s name , which means prophet .
you can &apos;t call that , that would be a little political , then again .
say , there &apos;s no more sophisticated .
immediately , you &apos;ll be able to get to that , of course , for the most of you , you know , that you can &apos;t prove .
and they have a problem .
because while they &apos;re busy , they &apos;re not able to prove that they can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no more fun , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s fooled .
because he has led them to a red run that he doesn &apos;t even get himself .
because actually , this human being isn &apos;t interested in evidence .
it &apos;s just interested in the need to be able to prove to yourself , to prove that there are a lot of time to prove that there &apos;s a lot of time .
so , in the way of the evidence of the evidence , you &apos;re experiencing the brilliance of the lie .
and once you have a way to feel this kind of thing , you can do it in other people , you do it , because you &apos;re going to make other happy , if you don &apos;t remember it in the way you &apos;re not going to remember your own .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve been asking myself to have a question of if i can mention them .
it &apos;s one of the most amazing moments of this great event , and i asked if i wanted to give a talk here and my idea .
i have to say , you &apos;ve got it , you know , it &apos;s hard to talk to me about my idea .
and i may be thinking , i &apos;m going to try to imagine my favorite thing .
but it &apos;s the sum of course , and many ideas .
i &apos;m probably , probably , the two nice girls , i &apos;m probably in the generation , which has been paid for this bad image image , because i &apos;ve started studying engineering , engineering , engineering , engineering , today , i think , i think , a kit .
and i was going to berlin in the mid- 1980s , because i wanted to make renewable energy and that was not in the street .
there was the most popular thing .
the so-called the phoenix islands , also , was called the most talkative .
the hot today is called the hot .
because a good engineer either built a great car or a good engineer .
but this is what the first thing that &apos;s like like &apos; n , from a hundred watts from the square square square , that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy nut .
i &apos;m grateful to the most grateful that he &apos;s got the word again , because after the most successful , you didn &apos;t use the word , because everything was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that much in the world &apos;s office .
there was a way that there was a lot of time , and one of them was sitting in the street in the field of the room where you thought that evil .
the place of the world &apos;s office , but that was called the wind and wind and energy and energy , and i started in the mid- 1980s .
and yes , a lot of what was said today , i &apos;m very , very , very , very beautiful , because many , many beautiful expressions i &apos;ve been living in .
i worked in the collective years in the collective , which was a very talkative .
we were 20 people .
if one didn &apos;t say , the most powerful thing was , that has a completely valid , and i &apos;ve got a hard job for 10 years , if i could really have my great job of my father , because all of my father &apos;s father has always been to hold it to the window of your child .
it &apos;s busy with insanity .
and that was really , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , a picture of a stick where i asked myself to have a thousand years , a thousand years old , of course , the collective , of course , whether that &apos;s supposed to be the great thing .
and i then have to go to the street , and then we have become a fellow of the company , and i &apos;ve become a pioneer of the company that was then brought together with the most powerful of the world &apos;s largest favorite of the world .
a key , but also , we have the problem of a growing company , and we then have a little group of a group , and we decided that we &apos;re going to start little and go back and go back to the next topic of the future and that &apos;s what i think is the same thing that people are going to say , that &apos;s what the people are doing , which is what &apos;s going to be like .
and i brought you a project that i want to introduce you to now .
and the title of speech was , yes , as you get to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started asking a relatively special story to ask where you could have a memory of a memory today .
this island , that &apos;s the island of the island of the island .
yes , these are the data .
there &apos;s four thousand people living there .
they have a renewables today from 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
it &apos;s just not technological .
if you wind more wind , the system starts to fail .
i &apos;m also telling the politicians when they &apos;re in the field of food , and they &apos;re going to be in the field of food .
and then they always say , why ?
we &apos;ve already got 20 percent in germany .
but it can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have seven percent , and our net is physically seen the european european .
if we had 20 percent , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was just , the answer was , the first contacts was the first , they &apos;re going to calculate the island , but just just through .
as big as big , because actually , a battery is so much , so you have a island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and yes , i &apos;ll go again again .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , a year of a hundred gigawatts of electric performance on the planet is completely packed on the world .
that &apos;s the performance of a hundred nuclear power , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the world &apos;s favorite world , which is going to be deleted , is because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s fast .
you &apos;re like , &quot; box box . &quot;
and then it looks like this .
in the run , three of the most popular , two will always wait .
yeah , this is the bottom line , the load is the burden .
we also have very precise data .
and the most important or the solar system or whatever it is , is in the rule of a system , or a system , which can only be a small amount of system in the small amount of time .
our goal was to say , okay , okay .
the north gas is going to be the wind and the wind , sun , the load of the load that you can map the bigger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the performance in the moment , you have to turn off the north .
that means that the moment you have to make the renewables are actually going to take the whole net .
you can only get it , of course , if you &apos;re managed to be managed in any way .
that &apos;s what nobody did on the world .
this is in the small style , so you can also use your car &apos;s car to be a little bit of a small car .
people always ask me what &apos;s going on in the street , because in the middle of the world ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
but if you want to do multiple of these online types , and you want to build a net , it &apos;s going to be extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to go to 70 to 90 percent renewable and then there &apos;s this rest of the rest that the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , that will be very , very expensive and that will not work , that you can do that from batteries .
that will be a fuel fuel , which then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , or sh , it will be .
you have to go to a more of a football system and not just balance and not just balance .
we just wanted to know what is a normal , more powerful battery , a battery .
how far is you going to get there ?
and then a whole bunch of simulations did .
and wind and sun and the sun and the load of the load and came to the result , a very exciting result that you need to take a middle of the conventional system to 20 years of a minimum , about 50 cents a gallon .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay , okay .
so , it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper as the most prolific , if the average five percent per year goes up .
and then we started to negotiate with the most sophisticated .
what would all be done ?
have investors negotiate , i &apos;ve looked for new york .
we were only five people at the time to build a society again .
and here &apos;s the representation .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system also has a more powerful , because we &apos;re still doing 20 percent with petrol , and also a more powerful thing to the other things .
and the most popular thing that the most important thing that the most important thing is , we have this really great thing .
let &apos;s also support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we can actually map the electrical conditions of the island in the scale of three very precisely .
that means we &apos;ve looked at the biggest battery in the world .
here she is .
it &apos;s from asia , in the case of japan .
and it &apos;s the bbc &apos;s &apos; 70s in the &apos; 70s , and today , the bbc &apos;s been developed , and then it became a japanese , and then it became the japanese .
it &apos;s you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has a megawatts of performance and can take six hours for this performance , and that &apos;s the battery that we have kind of a little bit of a carbon problem .
and then they set up .
we also have one of these most sophisticated in the same size , which is where he &apos;s put in the hall to actually see the entire dynamic behavior of this web , so in the hall , it &apos;s the big battery , which is the whole battery that we simulate the web .
over here , we &apos;re going to simulate the whole whole thing that &apos;s the most powerful , the cable &apos;s cables , to represent the internet &apos;s net .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we can also put two kilowatts of kilowatts on the web .
here we see this again , again , the north , again , the whole , individual , single , individual .
and what we &apos;ve done since the last year was the hall , then , until today , the space of the world is basically all of what the individual system was doing in electronics , we did .
so we &apos;re not a business of the world , but we &apos;re redefining as a company that is only between the subject and the subject of the web and everything in between .
you have to communicate , of course , to communicate , you have to communicate in the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is that you &apos;re basically in this island , basically , that you can get all the most important problems that we &apos;re going to get when we want to increase our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion , like going back , is going to go back and forth , and the way that we want to go to the island , for example , we have to be for the most successful , for example , for 30 percent of the wind , so we &apos;re going to be the wind and the sun .
and then , the point is that it &apos;s going to be a little bit of a time .
so , a computer company , a computer company everywhere .
we can start to integrate on the island , to integrate , to integrate , and you can manage the burden .
that means if you &apos;re at 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can go through the n , you can go through the nets , yes , you should do it in every case , the percentage of the money , but you can never get rid of memory .
and that &apos;s the message that &apos;s the message .
so , many people come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn off the north , you don &apos;t have these spinning mass , which is a certain inertia in the net .
and our main team is basically just rotating from louder masses of large power , where the wave is all around europe , all over europe .
we look at this web , and we see 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s nine hertz , nine hertz will start , we &apos;ll start a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of steam , then we &apos;ll get a little bit of a little bit of steam , then we get up .
this is the system .
and of course , this is incredibly central .
if you &apos;re going to get that somewhere , it &apos;s a while .
the main reserve has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in time , they can react again .
if you don &apos;t have that , these spinning mass , you have to replace it with a little bit of the time and the metal .
and we can actually put two milliseconds in the big battery .
and then you see what enormous amounts of water there is .
and the message is , we have to get rid of this rotating masses , if we kind of get our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 percent , 30 percent , and so on .
then we have to break our capacity to break down the net .
and the power station is simply running the power station to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a very , very clear moment , in the moment , because we don &apos;t , or we don &apos;t , or the other , because it &apos;s not .
and we &apos;re just trying to get the capacity to get the capacity to break down the capacity , and you can also break down memory by the web .
now , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies that are now .
and then , in this purpose , people always come and look at our own business , sort of our most sophisticated ones .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far you can get a piece of future to the future .
and many discussions that i had in the last six years , were similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years , for the theme of allah .
it &apos;s not , it &apos;s insanity , you know , we have all of them , we &apos;ve never got to do it .
we have 30 decibels today in germany .
this is a little bit of a plastic .
and i just go out of that , that we &apos;re going to store the same capacity in the next 30 years , and we &apos;re going to have the same capacity in the world .
just , it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s a whole lot of the data that &apos;s going to be there and arguments .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve been seeing the last two years in the last two years that scientists are going to be asking to my side .
we &apos;ve now got over 10 million of these , and we have to have a lot of the world &apos;s largest web to the german net .
this is going to be in the next april .
so , you know , there &apos;s a change that &apos;s there , and it &apos;s just about this kind of change , and it &apos;s just about this kind of assumption , and the idea of a hundred percent renewable is true .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a kind of a system of a system .
so far in discussions , it &apos;s always trying to do this , these miniature , which are going to be a little bit of a small net , which has nothing to do with our own little net .
the question is , if you &apos;re completely independent , if you &apos;re completely independent of some fossil or a half , you &apos;re going to be able to get into the world , and you &apos;re going to be a island .
then they just use what &apos;s going on on the sun and the wind where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a nuclear energy supply and i &apos;m also grateful to say that they &apos;ve said , solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and in the way we get , the talk of the ted community , that you can be a collective , and use solar energy , you can use a little bit together .
and yeah , i just want to encourage you to be quiet in the sense that you can be quiet , and you can have a vision .
and you really have to stay quite tough , but i think it &apos;s going .
thank you .
when steve lopez , the los angeles times , a day of los angeles , he went through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a sexually , african-american , rough , homeless , homeless , who had only two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from the paper &apos;s article , it was a book that was once a book that was going to be , with robert lopez , and jamie lopez , who was a very promising career , and jamie lopez , who was at the most successful and the very promising career , was finished by his favorite schizophrenia .
nathaniel left 1800 , suffered a breakdown and 30 years later he lived as a homeless on the streets of los angeles in the center of los angeles .
i recommend reading all of the time , and to watch the film , so that they don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness between these two men , but also how the music helped make this connection , and how they were doing the instrument , and the instrument of the way that it was allowed to get the instrument , nathaniel , from the street .
i met mr. chaplin in 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney hall .
he had just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first , and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine .
he talked to a very , very , very troubled and a clay note about yo-yo mama and hillary clinton and about how the dodgers never could do it in the baseball world series , and that &apos;s all because of the most popular passage of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
we came to talk to music . and a few days later , i got an email , which was that nathaniel was interested in the street for me .
i have to mention that nathaniel is a medical treatment , because he was already with electric and with a lot of plastic and with a lot of time and being treated with a trauma that has been tracking his whole life .
so , as a result , he &apos;s particularly vulnerable to this schizophrenic stages , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he &apos;s going away for days , in the streets of the street row , always that horror and the most prolific of his own mind .
and in fact , in the same way , nathaniel was when we started with our first class in walt disney hall , and he had this kind of crazy thing in his eyes and worked completely .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and how somebody wanted to poison it in their sleep .
i was afraid not to be a , but i was afraid that i could lose him in one of his states , and that i could destroy him his relationship to the violin , if i started to talk about scale and the other exciting forms of the world &apos;s brain .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s first sentence .
and while i was playing , i fell on a complete change in the face of a complete change .
it was like he was under the impact of a invisible drug , a chemical response , which was a catalyst my game .
and the wild designer anger turned into understanding , in a calm curiosity and grace .
and as a miracle took his violin , he started playing his violin , and then he started playing some clips of the video of the video , and then asked me to play them , and then , you know , play , the street , the street , the street , the street .
we started talking about music , starting from bach , from beethoven , filmed , and all the other people who were going to be the other , from the street to the street , to the other .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just know a little bit about music , but it was also a close personal relationship with her .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i know otherwise from my colleagues in the abalone los angeles .
by playing music , and talking about music , was made of this kind of thing , confused man , who was just moved through the streets of los angeles , a computer , a great , great , excellent , in juilliard .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means emotional health .
because the music allows him to be his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in something real .
and so he &apos;s the most eager to do his charming conditions .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
this is why we do music : so we do something that is inside of us , deep inside of our emotions , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of this expression is that all of us , and it &apos;s moving , inspired and together .
what nathaniel set up , it brought him back to a community of friends .
the power of music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood him , who recognized his talent and the environmental technologies .
and i &apos;m going to always be with nathaniel music , whether in the walt disney hall or in a row of a row , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno &apos;s : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i have stolen the most of the time .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first , that was more like a passionate kind of passion .
it was a beautiful fish , a good fish , good consistency , a new , a library on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was supposed to be in the most appropriate standards of sustainability .
so you could feel that you could be selling it .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
one day , the head of the company called the company , and i asked if i could talk about the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem has become for our cooks , how do we keep fish on our tracks ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve collapsed the ocean as we beat the forests bare .
it &apos;s hard to get the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the tuna , the most cosmopolitan , they are collapsed , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , maybe or bad , or bad , is a part of our future .
many arguments about it . the environment , most of you , the environment , most of you , and you &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a video of 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of water is necessary to get a pound of a pound .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so finally , there was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the president of the pr for the company .
let &apos;s call him don .
&quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for that , so far outside the sea that you don &apos;t get rid of the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out of the waste that waste is distributed from our fish , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this is the one that was like , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
and then , two , great .
&quot; the &quot; two &quot; one ? what is your feeding ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
and at that night , i was in bed , and i thought , what about hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t stop .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you know what to do for example ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to be aware .
well , i &apos;m going to do a couple of people in the company . no one could give me a decent answer to me , until finally , i finally joined the senior biologists .
let &apos;s also call it don &apos;t .
&quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; what for example are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some of the things that he said , and then he said , &quot; he said , &quot; he &apos;s got a little bit of ink .
i said , &quot; well , &quot; do you know ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , skin , body , dry , dry and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your life is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , these are about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you know what &apos;s sustainable to feed chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i &apos;m going to get off this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a computer scientist and i &apos;m a vegetarian .
i &apos;m even .
no , i actually have a fish of this fish , because , i swear to god , the fish , after that conversation , tasted chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love .
it &apos;s the romantic way that you know , the better you learn your fish , you love the fish more .
i was eating him first in a restaurant in a restaurant .
a very successful journalist had spoken for a long time .
it &apos;s a kind of a little bit of a time .
he came up with a bright , almost white white color .
the chef had him .
wait twice .
amazingly , he still was delicious .
who can make a fish so well after it became a little bit of time ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it miguel . actually , he &apos;s called miguel .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish and he &apos;s not a chef at least , at least the way they and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at a university of la la .
this is a very reactive in the street corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s was the farm in the hands of the street .
they grew up in the way that they were basically wetlands .
they did that by turning the country into the country .
they built these complicated episode of channels , and they cut water out of the country and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t do that , they did not work economically .
and it was a disaster .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds , which are a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company bought the country .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of the water in the water .
they literally broke the lever .
instead of using water , they used the channels to get the water back .
they &apos;re going to be the canals .
they created a 11,000 acres of water -- the street , shrimp , shrimp , shrimp , and they have swollen and his company the ecological destruction completely .
the farm is incredibly .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see are the canals and these density , lush march .
i was not a long time ago with swollen .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a part of &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were and fought through the wetlands and i was going to be a little bit of the wetlands and i have a little bit of the street , and i was going to keep mud , and i &apos;m quiet in quiet , and it &apos;s a little bit of a sudden .
and he &apos;s going to put a rare video set .
now he mentioned the most uplifting of grievances .
and here , he sees a pattern of simulated , which reminds him of the most powerful giraffe .
it turns out that miguel the biggest part of his career spent in the national park in africa .
i asked him how to have a kind of a football machine .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and falls into more talk from rare birds and algae and weird and weird .
and you don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the most amazing community , in the way that you have in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak about this kind of delicious piece of delicious fish that i had on the top of the day .
so i cut him down . i said , &quot; shawn , how does it feel that your fish tastes so good ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the rhode , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what are your fish eating ?
how is the most important thing ? &quot;
now , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s a rich system that the fish eat , which they would eat in the wild .
the root biomass , the cambrian , the zoo , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely valid .
there &apos;s no food .
the one farm is not feeding their animals ?
later , i went on on this site with miguel , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems to be so , &quot; for a place that seems to be , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
in the moment , it was like a director of a film director .
and we went to the corner and we had the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pinker , literally , a literally pinker carpet , so far the eye is going to be enough .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your own , pink .
they &apos;re going to be . &quot;
and i was totally confused ?
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you , you know , your fish , you don &apos;t ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and the birds .
now , last year , 600,000 birds were over the site , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s now the largest and one of the most important private systems in europe .
i said , &quot; well , is it a good job of a good job , not the last one you want to have on a computer party ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building the air , not intense .
this is a environmental network .
the food industry eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the pinker the gut the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals and a farm that measures your success in your health care .
a computer company , but also a more cosmopolitan .
oh , and by the way , these are not even the same thing that we should be doing .
they breed in a city of 240 miles , where the most common is better for the most violent .
every morning they fly 240 miles to farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles .
they do that because they can follow the white white line of the highway .
seriously .
i had introduced a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at it .
i said , &quot; shawn , fly you to the farm and fly back to the farm , and then you fly 240 miles back the night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me as if i was quoted just a song from whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like a throwaway , i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this kind of carbon , the taste of flavor .
i &apos;m almost never cooking with it .
and yet , when i tried to try and do it in this restaurant in a restaurant , she didn &apos;t tasted it at all .
she liked sweet and she would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned this to miguel and he &apos;s going to be a little bit of a mess .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense , before something in the body .
she has developed the evolution of evolution to be a little bit of a mess . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no idea . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your fish . a farm that measures your success on success .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a plastic company , he &apos;s got enormous , because the water , which comes through this farm from the river , comes out of the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things to do with rivers today , to lead to the chemical pollutants , flow of plastic dioxide .
and if it was fought through the system , and this leaves the water , it &apos;s clean than it &apos;s like it &apos;s a clean .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not only a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that measures their success at the health of their predators , but a farm that literally is a very , very much , and not only for you and me .
because if the water is blowing up , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this love , like romantic , is also telling you .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about the future or a nuclear disease .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food , actually , good taste .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
we &apos;re not a military , we &apos;re a little bit of a business . we &apos;re a lover .
we love farmers . we love small amounts of food . we &apos;re talking about local food . we eat organic .
and if you say that the things that are good food is a good food , somebody else says , &quot; hey , hey , i love people , i love the world , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;ve been producing enough calories to feed the world more than only to feed .
a billion people are starving today .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of the inequalities in the distribution , not the greenhouse gas emissions .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because they have the logic of our own 50 years of the last 50 years .
feed grain of herbivores , the chemicals on the earth , chemicals on earth , chicken , and the whole time has just asked the agribusiness , &quot; if we feed more people , how awful can that be ? &quot;
this was the cause . it was the easy thing . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a craft in a corporate service , a craft that &apos;s fast in the very advanced capital that allows you to do that .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our main business is threatened today , not due to the long-term growth , but because of the resources of resources .
not by the latest , and the most prolific , but by fertile land , not by pumps , but through fresh water , not by norwegian , but through forests , and not by the fish , but by the fish in the sea .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that allow each community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in the field of the body , and it never has a really good thing to eat .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is the one that &apos;s going to be in two billion years of expertise .
look at sterile farmers like miguel .
businesses that are not worlds for themselves , businesses that are trying to restore , rather than just intense , businesses , rather than just intense , farmers who are not just planned , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are experts too .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i will ever be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if the future is good food , it &apos;s delicious .
thank you .
if i want to illustrate one thing today , it &apos;s that the whole data that we consume is bigger than the sum of their parts and rather than thinking about how we can use information that &apos;s going to be the way we can use the information that &apos;s not visible and we can see that the pattern has been otherwise not visible .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical kind of old age of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called the most powerful and what i can do with a little bit of a cause of death , and i can say , i can filter accidents .
and i immediately see another pattern that makes it happen .
and that &apos;s because in the most active , people are most active and they &apos;re over here at the most part .
we can go out and get out of the data and see the data , and see that the standard and cancer is the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , if we go on and go to age , we &apos;re going to see 40 years or younger , we &apos;re going to see that accidents are even the cause of the people who should worry about .
and who &apos;s looking at that is that it &apos;s true in men .
so you see that this is a very , very much information , and data in this way is reminded in a living environment .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not also do it for content itself ?
what we &apos;re now here is the most individual of the individual &quot; sport &quot; that were ever printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it to my talk in your rooms .
with a decade , you can break into a decade .
you can get into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this copy and the sports .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i click here , so i &apos;ll show all of the time that i &apos;m going to show you all the time that lance armstrong is going to be mentioned .
now , if i want to get a picture of a moment , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the subject of a shower ? &quot;
so i go back to a step and i &apos;m going to go back to the view .
now i see greg chaplin &apos;s .
and so you get an idea that if you hit this kind of information , more specifically , more diverse , zoom , you don &apos;t look at , you don &apos;t just want to be celebrating or not just just .
you do something that is actually a little different .
it &apos;s something between and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to do this idea a little bit more about what &apos;s a little crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single single single single single one , and it reduced to a little summary .
the summary contains a short picture and a symbol of the area that comes from it .
i just just show the top 500 of the top of the top .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
and we immediately get a sense of the issues that are on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the government &apos; government .
now , after i chose government , i know that the most important thing that the most important time is that the time is called &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important , because this is a realization that doesn &apos;t exist in a single single single single single single single single single single single single single .
that &apos;s just to recognize if you go back and look at the whole thing .
so , in a certain way , i can take a look at this kind of summaries , and then i can go into the theme of time , &quot; people of the year , &quot; and all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i know the majority of these are the majority of the people . some of them come from science . some of them , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can jump and look at all the ted prize winner .
you see , we &apos;re surfing in the net , the first time it &apos;s really a net , not just to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
i just show you the new york times website .
so , the application , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with them -- and we bring these online pieces to each other as this .
so i can go back to a step , and just jump to a specific unit .
so that &apos;s important because you just look at the websites in this kind of way , and that &apos;s the way that you can see all the stuff in the same way .
so i can zoom in in my course in a particular place .
here &apos;s the whole demonstration that i &apos;ve been holding to this .
and i can sort of see anything i &apos;ve seen today , again , again .
and , if i look back at a step , and look at everything , i can actually redefine my course of my own , and here , i &apos;ve looked for the &quot; search of &quot; looking for bing , or here , after live labs .
and i can go from here to the side and go back to it .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used again , and every time it &apos;s going to make the big bang , the sum of the brain &apos;s .
now in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the curse of the world &apos;s curse .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going from one to another , we start to go from many things to many things , and to recognize patterns that otherwise would be hidden ?
if we can do this , then this past time , maybe this is a new source of information , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of moving into information , we can get knowledge of it .
and if we know , we can even even get wisdom from it .
so i hear , thank you very much .
i grew up with a major science science fiction .
in my school , i went to school with the bus , every day a hour per hour .
and my nose always took my nose in a book , a computer company that was forced to be locked in other worlds and my mind in the way that i was in my deep worlds , and i &apos;m going to suggest , shiny curiosity .
this curiosity also showed that i was always , when i wasn &apos;t in school , through the forests , and they were collecting , &quot; samples , &quot; frogs and snakes and bugs and beetles , all after the microscope .
i was totally embarrassed , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and explore the boundaries of the possible way .
and my love to science fiction seemed to be in my environment , because then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and explored the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world of wonder showed us that we never had imagined .
and that &apos;s what i think is really good at the same time .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there &apos;s no video video that &apos;s still the video video with a computer-generated film , and there was a whole picture of the imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we had to all have that , when we read a book , we took the description of the author , and we put it on the screen in our heads .
my response to this was drawing and paint from aliens , aliens , robots , robots , and all this stuff .
in math class , i was constantly caught by the teacher , as i was hiding in the textbook , in the textbook .
creativity had to be somehow out .
and what happened is something interesting . which is what i was fascinated with , which is jacques &apos;s thought , was the idea of a completely unknown world on earth itself .
i certainly would never have a alien world with a spaceship , and that seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i could actually enter here on earth , and she was equally fascinating and exotic like all that i &apos;ve been thinking about when i was reading these books .
so i decided to be 15 , diver .
the only problem that i was in a small village was in canada , a mile removed from the next ocean .
i didn &apos;t hate me .
i &apos;m going to have my father , until finally , a college in buffalo , new york , to find out exactly the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my favorite in a pool of the middle of the winter in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got two years later to face , when we moved to california .
since , in the 40 years , the age of the age of 40 , i spent about three hours of water . 500 hours of it in submersibles .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the ocean &apos;s ocean , is so rich in the ocean , as we can really imagine .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know borders , unlike our own , more human imagination .
and to the days , i feel deep awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love to the ocean is holding up with the same intensity as ever as ever .
when i was a kid , it was a career , it was the assistant .
that seemed the best way to tell my inner grip , to tell stories , to create pictures , to unite images .
as a child , i was constantly drawing books and so .
so films were the way to bring pictures and stories and stories together .
of course , the stories i &apos;m going to do was , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aliens . &quot;
i could put my preference on the air , and i could connect to the senior world .
so , basically , my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; the &quot; the &quot; to solve a problem in this movie -- and that &apos;s what we had to create a kind of liquid carbon system -- we picked up a computer-generated animation , we picked up , back .
what came out of this was the first computer-generated map ever to see in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t bring money to the film , and he was just saying his costs , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience on the whole world was like mesmerized , which was taken out of the magic .
according to arthur clarke &apos;s law , the law of the law is not to distinguish and magic .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s really going to be involved in the most important . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , even more .
together with a computer , we created the guy from liquid metal , and the success was very , very much about how this effect would come .
and it worked . again , we had created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same thing , but we &apos;ve got a little bit more money with the film .
from these two experiences , a whole new world was achieved , a whole new world of creativity for the world .
so i started a company , with my good friend stan , who was the best of the best , and the best of the best , and she was called &quot; digital , &quot; &quot; digital . &quot;
the idea of this company was , the phase of analog processes with visual printers , and start to start with digital printers .
and we did that , and we managed to give a advantage of a advantage of a while .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the field of the field and the most important thing we did , which we actually started to do -- too slow .
i wrote this piece &quot; avatar &quot; that would be written in things visual effects and the effects of the effects in new heights , with comparable human , expressive characters that were made by the design , and the world &apos;s supposed to be a little bit more powerful . and the world should be a little bit more powerful .
but the bar was very beautiful back . and people in my company said that we &apos;re not able to be able to do that .
so i moved this and made this other film about the big ship that goes .
and i sold this as &quot; pearl and julia on a ship , &quot; and it became a very keen epic scale , a passionate film .
but i was actually trying to immerse the real train of the titanic .
so i did the film .
this is the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but i &apos;ve convinced you , by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to go to the train . we &apos;re going to go to the real train .
we &apos;re going to show it in the movie of the film .
this is very important . it &apos;s a good job for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but again , that &apos;s going to be a reality that can make a reality .
we actually created six months later , in which i &apos;m in a russian , in a russian event , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i looked at the real titanic through a computer of the north atlantic .
this was not a movie , no more a movie , that was really .
so , that really blew me .
and the level of preparation was enormous . we had to build cameras and the lights and all kinds of things .
and i noticed how much these things , a kind of a similar piece of light .
well , they were also more competent and more sophisticated to the more sophisticated .
you go up into these capsule , you go down into this dark , hot environment , where no hope is on saving , if you don &apos;t get it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as though i was in a nazi .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on with curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that could not give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .
in some of the next expeditions i &apos;ve seen creatures in the world , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that haven &apos;t seen before , and for the science of the time , when we saw them , they didn &apos;t have any words .
so that &apos;s really what i &apos;m doing right now , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met a little bit unusual .
after the titanic , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my favorite , as a filmmaker in hollywood , and i &apos;m going to put a filmmaker for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we were starting to see &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; and they were exploring with the computer .
we went back to the backside of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which was a computer company .
our intention was , and the inner thing to look at , and look at the inside of the ship , which was never done before .
no one had ever explored the inner of the body , and you didn &apos;t have any means for it , so we developed the technology .
and i &apos;m sitting there , and i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a computer scanner , and see planks that are quite similar to this kind of thing , and i know that once the band has played there .
and i fly with a little bit of a little bit of the ship through the ship .
i &apos;m actually serving it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically within the titanic of the titanic .
this was the most popular form of a computer that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i put a corner of a corner , i always knew what was going on in the car &apos;s vehicle , because i was going to the film .
because the set was a very precise copy of the design of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
she made me consciously aware that you use such a kind of thing that you use , and that &apos;s how your consciousness can be in the vehicle , and that &apos;s how you can get the other shape of existence .
it was really profound .
and maybe a little glimpse of what might happen in some decades , if you have a little bit of time to explore or do something else , in all sorts of different forms of information that i can imagine as a maker of mine .
after this expeditions , we started what we saw down there , really appreciate , for example , this kind of thing , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals , and that &apos;s kind of alien , but here on earth .
they live with help .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight , as we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
and i was also interested in the same time for the same time , which was the most important thing from my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who are interested in space and to do the nasa and the right thing , and they &apos;re going to be able to go through russia , go through the mission , and go through the mission , and take the international record , and take our most , to the international , and take our online data .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was going to be that i took a lot of time to the deep sea .
i took them to the world , and i gave them access to the world , and the way they were , the most extreme , people who are interested in such extreme situations , i took them to the sources of the way they could take samples and test instruments and so on .
we were doing a puppet , but actually science , in fact , was in science , more frankly .
so the circle of my existence as a child , as a child , and the ability to be in reality .
and i learned a lot of this voyage over the course of this voyage .
i learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you &apos;re sure a director has to lead , a leader , like a leader or something like that .
but i didn &apos;t understand much of leadership before i get this expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
this is a perfect movies that we don &apos;t get to make .
we &apos;re just playing the power costs . it &apos;s not a priority .
all of you think i &apos;m between titanic and &quot; avatar &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and i would have a towel on a towel on the beach .
i &apos;ve all made these films , these phrases , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it about the task to be the challenge -- and the ocean is the most powerful environment that you have . you &apos;re doing it because of the strange connection , and because of the strange connection that comes when a small group of people form a team .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who worked for years , and sometimes we were two to three months in the sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the chance that you have one of them , because you &apos;ve been able to overcome a task that you can &apos;t explain any other .
if you go back to land and say , &quot; we had to do it , the transplant , the whole technology , and the difficulty , the whole technology , and the difficulty , the human performance , if you work on the sea , you can &apos;t explain it to somebody . that &apos;s how you can &apos;t explain to somebody .
there &apos;s a connection , a respect , a respect .
so when i returned to turn my next film &quot; avatar &quot; , i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you &apos;re being respected and made in return to respect .
so , this was really changed the dynamics .
so i was back with a little team on the unknown terrain , and we were called avatar with a new technology that hasn &apos;t had before .
incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we became a very short family for a period of four years .
so , this changed my way to make films completely .
there were people who said we had this kind of thing , and we were actually transported to the planet , and they were going to be transported to the planet .
for me , it was more a kind of a research way to do my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we do from all of this ?
what lessons do we learn ?
i think the first thing is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the warning of your team is more important than all of the world &apos;s most important .
and i come to young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t even have a difference .
you get other people . don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t bet yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has a more sophisticated one : &quot; fail is not an alternative . &quot;
but in the art and study , it has to fail to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a more powerful one .
no important endeavor , innovation was used , ever without risk .
you have to be ready to take risks like this .
this is the idea i &apos;d like to give you to the way . fail is a alternative , fear , but not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and that might surprise you , because my favorite thing in the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds to make things that we have to invent and deliver to the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , actually , even more important than anyone else on the planet .
and the fact that the distribution of the people are not growing over many years , and it &apos;s too much rain , and we &apos;re going to rain too much , and things are going to change as it can &apos;t be able to sustain their fragile environment .
it leads to the lead . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , a climate change is going to be terrible for you .
and also , the most important thing for you is that it &apos;s very important .
the fact is , if you could only reduce the price of the price , the energy would be more effective at far .
well , the most successful thing is that we &apos;ve been like the time .
in fact , the most important thing is based on the street .
the industrial revolution was going to have the industrial revolution and even in the 20th century , there was a case in the middle of the world , and therefore we have refrigerators , air conditioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s take the price down -- we &apos;re going to go to a new barrier and that barrier with co2 .
co2 is increasing the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they add the carbon dioxide , which leads to the most powerful and the most negative , and the effects of the weather , and maybe worse , the indirect consequence that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to the same , and so all systems collapse .
well , the exact relationship between a computer and the net that &apos;s the net , and where the other consequences are , there are some of the most pollinators , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i asked the most few times , &quot; do we really have to go down to zero ?
isn &apos;t it enough or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we come close to zero , the temperature will continue to increase .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a 3.5 foot high truck , which has to be under a three feet , and then you can put it underneath .
this is a very , very , very clear one .
well , we &apos;re going to get a lot of carbon &apos;s data out of 26 billion tons of tons .
every americans are about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons of every planet on the planet .
and somehow we need to create changes that are down to zero .
it &apos;s been up to it .
only different economic changes have influenced it , and we have to go from the rise to reducing the increase and to reduce a reduction to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of a relief . they have this thing on the left -- co2 , which they want to bring zero and that &apos;s going to depend on the number of people who are using the average energy for service and co2 , which is a unit of energy .
so let &apos;s take a look at each factor , and we think we &apos;re going to get that on zero .
probably one of these numbers has to come very close to zero .
now , this is a fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first we have the population .
today , 350,000 billion people live .
and it turns out to be nine billion of the time that we &apos;re going to move on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the most powerful and the most powerful , we might probably reduce that 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope to 1.3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
it includes all the food that we eat , clothing , television , heat .
these are very good things , and they &apos;re very good at making these services available to every one on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might probably be able to do and use less , but in average , this number will rise every year and so on , and so on average , the number of services will be put in a person .
here we see a very fundamental service . there &apos;s a light at home , so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their own color under the water .
now , at efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
because of different successes in the world &apos;s office , through other ways , through new methods , there are many services , there are many services whose energy will reduce some individual services .
in other service , like making the manufacturing of the creation , 105 hours : &apos; 20s -- &amp; lt ; / 7 : &amp; lt ; / 7 : the name of the car , is a lot smaller .
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a reduction to a factor three or maybe even a factor six or maybe a factor of six .
but at the first three factors , we &apos;re now from 26 billion tons of tons of tons , and that &apos;s not enough .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to be a unit of energy .
it turns out that you can get that on zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every single time of electricity for electricity today , co2 , but renewables .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need a lot of food .
now , if i use the word &quot; wonders , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these wonders .
there &apos;s no deadline that you have to have a miracle to a particular date .
usually you &apos;re just going to be wrong and some of you are not coming .
but in this case , we have to give up and get a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how can i really get this out ?
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that the idea of people here are going to be here ?
i remembered last year when i got mosquitos and somehow liked people .
the idea was really , really , really tangible , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , this was a place .
i decided that the front of fireflies would be my favorite contribution to the environment here .
so here &apos;s a couple of natural fireflies .
you &apos;ve told me that you don &apos;t bite . you &apos;re not going to even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of different types of information like this , but they &apos;re not going to get all of them .
we need solutions , either one or a few times a unimaginable scale and unimaginable government , and even though there are many directions where people are looking for , i really see five who can afford these big demands .
i &apos;ve left the tides , the wind , fusion and biofuels .
these may be a moderate contribution , and if you expect better than i expect , it &apos;s great , but my punch line here is that we have to work on all these five , and we can &apos;t give them a significant problem because they &apos;re all significant problems .
let &apos;s first look at fossil fuels , burning from either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there is maybe just , but it &apos;s not . you have to do all the co2 that comes out of the warm , and you get to get out of pressure , and then you hope that there &apos;s still .
there are some of the most powerful ones that are going to create a 60 percent level , but it &apos;s going to be 100 percent of it , and it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get a sense of the co2 , and a sense of the fuel of the co2 is a big challenge .
who will make it secure ?
who can guarantee something that literally many billion times larger than any kind of waste you can imagine from the food and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a tough thing .
next : the next thing .
it also has three big problems , the cost of , especially in the world , in the world , and the question is , for safety , you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human cooperation , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the garbage ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work .
the last three of the five , i put in .
it &apos;s the renewables that are often called the most .
and also , even though it &apos;s great , it &apos;s not that you don &apos;t need fuel -- you have some drawbacks .
one is the energy density that makes these technologies dramatically lower than the power of power .
these are the most powerful , you talk about many of the most powerful , thousand times more area than a normal power station .
and also , these vents are compromised .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem to be all day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be every day and the wind is not constantly going to be the wind .
so you have to depend on these sources , you have a way to have energy in times , and you &apos;re not available to get it .
so there &apos;s big amounts of data here . there are challenges in the transmission , and if we say that the energy source is beyond the country , you don &apos;t need to just have the technology , you have to have the risk of where different from the other .
and there &apos;s the most profound thing .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve all made the kinds of batteries that are made , which is the cars , computers , mobile phones , for everything . and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been doing with the amount of electronic energy that the world is using , and i found that all batteries that we produce now are less than 10 minutes of the world &apos;s population .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be a factor of 100 better than the approaches to time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
that happens when you try to get these online vents over , we &apos;re going to get 20 percent of the rest of the rest of the rest .
if you want to support 100 percent of it , you need an incredible amount of energy .
now , where should we go : what is the right approach ?
&quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the target ?
what we need is many companies that work on this . hundreds .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
so , in many ways , they &apos;re saying , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there &apos;s a lot of people here in the ted group that already have been engaged there .
bill big has several companies , among other people , who have the great health industry .
and the most interesting thing is , in dozens of companies , they invest the great things and have interesting opportunities and i try to support it .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that , perhaps surprisingly , is the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the field of innovation ; it &apos;s liquid , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry some time ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are lying around .
the most important thing is that instead of part of the brain &apos;s brain , you have a percent of the most powerful , the one percent , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the most expensive .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it , but you could never simulate any sensible , whether it would work , but there &apos;s a modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and see that , yes ! with the right , it &apos;s going to be that it &apos;s been profitable .
and because you burn these 99 percent , the most powerful thing is much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can actually use the waste of today &apos;s reactors as a result of the data .
instead of breaking the head , they just burn it . a great thing .
so the uranium is using gradually , a little bit like a candle .
you see that it &apos;s a kind of pillar , often as a &quot; traveling wave reactor . &quot;
it really solves the most important .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called the uranium uranium .
the base of the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re very cheap and just a little bit of fuel , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
how should our testimony look like ?
well , let &apos;s go to the goal that we need to reach and then talk about the most important .
many of the time , from a 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something agriculture , hopefully , and hopefully , it &apos;s going to be clean and cement until then .
so to get these 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , are completely changing .
the other note says whether we use the technology technology , whether they &apos;re used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is a key component of this .
if we go back from there , how should this be in 2020 ?
it should have the two elements .
we should use the most sophisticated to bring reduction on the way , the less we get the less , the less , the lower , and also the temperature .
but actually , this note is the things that we do not completely lead to the big , big , very important , or even less important , or even less important than the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
this is the breakthroughs we have to pursue with the data , and we can measure that : in the blink of the , in the lab , in the world , in the world .
there &apos;s a lot of great books to this topic .
al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david &apos;s energy , &quot; the hot air , &quot; the hot air . &quot;
they really go through and create a frame where this can be discussed in the wide world , because we need to support all sides .
there &apos;s a lot of that needs to come together .
this is a wish .
a very special wish , that we invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that wish , or i could choose that wish , which is , i think , is going to take a wish .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this desire , the dig between the long and the short term people are going to be terrible between the united states and china , between poor and rich , and almost all of the lives of this two billion will be very bad .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i mean ?
we need to use more research for more research .
if countries are meeting in places like the world , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should discuss these kinds of things and they would be shocked by the ridiculous low funds that are spent for these innovative approaches .
we need to use carbon dioxide , carbon taxes , wireless &amp; amp ; trade , which is a design system .
we need to spread the message .
we need to have dialogue , and we have to lead full and complete things that are going to be done by government .
it &apos;s a very important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- just to give you a sense of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , all the great scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we need only a few million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s reasonable , you &apos;re just in the most responsible million .
the hard step is building the first swim , finding another billion , the most powerful and the place of actually building the first one .
once the first finished , when he &apos;s going to be like , it &apos;s all very clear , because the economy , the energy density is so different than the energy density , as we know them .
to understand that right : that means building deep in the ground almost like a vertical column of nuclear energy , this use and then the process starts to go up and work on the top ?
and the thing is , right . now , you have to new the reactor , so there &apos;s a lot of people and lots of control that can go wrong . this thing is where you open it and things are going to be going to be a little bit . that &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can put it into 60 years -- think of a column -- you &apos;re buried , without all the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there , and it &apos;s a 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
a key one , the self provides a solution for the garbage .
so , yes , yeah . now , what happens to the garbage : you can sit it up -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it on the next reactor .
and we start by taking the waste , which is already already , that is in these areas of these , or the reactors in these reactors , and that &apos;s our main system .
so , what &apos;s a problem for these reactors was that what we &apos;re going to do in our fill and it &apos;s reduced to the most dramatic process as this process .
but while they talked about different people in the world , they &apos;ve been talking about these possibilities .
where is the biggest interest , so what really do you do ?
so , we &apos;ve not been asking a place to have a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting things that we have in the name of the nuclear name , and there &apos;s a lot of interest and people in russia , india , china -- i was here and talked about the energy minister , and talked about how this is going to fit to the world &apos;s energy .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something to do in the direction .
this is a kind of a thing that was made .
this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries built this , so everyone who has a quick reactor , a very rapid reactor for our first .
in your mind , is that space space , and the probability of something really like to call it ?
so , we need to have one of these most powerful things , and we need to do things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then use 20 years to use .
this is sort of the deadline that we &apos;ve been showing the most striking , which we have to follow .
and , you know , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds , the same , as their approaches work , that works for their pilots , for their pilots , for the sake of their pilots .
and it would be best if it &apos;s going to create multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
and we need a solution to each other .
the big breakthroughs , is this the largest , the biggest you know ?
so , a computer designer is the most important thing .
it would have been without the most important , but it &apos;s the power that it &apos;s been so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know how to do that as well as this , but there &apos;s the modular method , which is another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid carbon system that seems to be a little bit difficult , but maybe that &apos;s what it looks like .
and so there &apos;s different , but the beauty is that a million times a million times a million times as much energy as one , say , a computer and so , if you can deal with the problems and the cost of the land , the impact , the footprint , and the cost of the land , is almost in a own league .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to have a little bit of the idea to try to keep the most stable stable ?
and if you &apos;re in this situation , it &apos;s like you &apos;re eating too much , and you &apos;re just a heart attack , and what you do is you &apos;re going to do a heart attack , and you might need a heart attack or something .
there &apos;s a research cloud called the whole research that &apos;s called the different techniques to deny the warming , so we would be given 20 or 30 years longer to get us to the rest of us .
this is just a single one .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t work at all because you &apos;re going to make it wrong , so you &apos;re eating it , because you know that you &apos;re going to save the heart procedure .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you take the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in a way that you should have a conversation about whether you should have the things that are going faster , or that innovation needs longer than we expect .
climate change : have you got a or two sentences for you to convince you ?
so , the world &apos;s , unfortunately , is the skeptics in very different camps .
the ones that make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that are moving things ?
there are very , very few things you can tell at all , from which there is a chance in a million .
the biggest problem here is like aids .
you &apos;re doing the mistakes now , and you pay for a lot later .
and so the idea , now , if you have all kinds of problems , to invest in something that you only have later -- and that &apos;s where the investment is not so clear . actually , the ipcc report doesn &apos;t necessarily look at the worst scenario and there &apos;s people in the rich world , and they &apos;re saying , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
the fact is that this uncertainty should be worried about us .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economically , and the co2 is going to say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not an co2 , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not a carbon footprint , i wish it &apos;s not a carbon footprint , i wish it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the most important argument that if you use all of these time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals that are going to be suffering from malaria and so on , that there &apos;s a stupid waste of resources that we can do .
so , the real time , the actual spending for research -- say , the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year than they do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
and there are other things that should not suffer .
you get too large money , and you can disagree with reasonable people , if you have something that &apos;s not economically , and trying to fund that .
because it &apos;s very short , you know , a very short one , and funded only the learning curve , and i think we should try to be more things that have the potential to be very much less expensive .
if the faucet you get , you can get a very high amount of water , then you can only keep the rich .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even more , it &apos;s thinking .
his new computer technology is now : &quot; why don &apos;t research be talked anymore ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to be because of his former stories associated with the most violent , but he understood that this is a very lonely group and therefore he &apos;s going to get the most lonely group .
and that &apos;s a train that i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little people will be supporting .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking for almost all people here , if i say , i really hope you &apos;re going to be true . thank you very much .
so , thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , peter mcchrystal &apos;s a computer company called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . the biggest thing is , the biggest largest structure of the structure with 20 spaghetti , about a meter of tape , about feet , and build a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be up on top .
and , although it really seems to be really hard , it &apos;s really hard to work on it , because people are very quickly working on working .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a more complex .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , developers and architects , even with the most powerful and there &apos;s something that &apos;s going to allow you to share with the very deep sensations in nature and i want to share some of them .
usually most people start to orient themselves to the task .
they talk about it , they &apos;re thinking about how it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to be .
then they invest a little bit in planning and organization . they draw and put spaghetti sauce .
they &apos;re investing in the most sophisticated structures in the world &apos;s office .
and finally , before you don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow and you &apos;re putting it gently on the top , step back and &quot; the &quot; -- &quot; you admire your work .
but then , almost always , it &apos;s happening , that the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; is &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the marshmallow &quot; is that the whole thing is going to bend and make it .
there &apos;s a series of people who have much more &quot; mass &quot; moments than others , and under the worst , fresh water .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and they really make a lot of things .
and of course , there are teams that have much more &quot; more &quot; more &quot; more &quot; and the best ones are fresh students , and they &apos;re the best fresh students .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , they didn &apos;t just make the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might be wondering is : how does this happen ? why ? what about those ?
and peter says , &quot; none of the kids are invested at the head of the spaghetti store . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in the street .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that &apos;s that the fact that the computer is trained to find a real plan , ok !
and then it &apos;s to realize .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s different is that they start with the marshmallow and building prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , so that they have a range of the opportunity to repair the possibility of fixing prototypes .
and the way that we see this kind of collaboration is a core of a core kind of a core error .
and with each trial , the kids get immediately feedback , and what &apos;s not .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , and we see , again , how different teams act .
the average for most of the time is about the most violent , and the most of them are creating lawyers , but not much , more , more than the adults .
who is most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
and the highest thing i &apos;ve seen is the highest thing .
and why ? because they understand triangles and they &apos;re the key geometric patterns to build robust structures .
ceos are something about average . but here it is interesting .
you put a law of authority on the team , you &apos;ll be significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see around and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict the predictions . why is this ?
because they have special skills of the internet .
they &apos;re pushing the process , they understand it .
and that team , which is going to turn down and watch the work of the team , is significantly improving the performance of the team .
and they &apos;re specialized skills and the combination of their combination to success .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six , which have a stable structure .
i tried something interesting now .
i thought we &apos;re going to bring the same thing to the same .
so i offered a $ 10,000 prize to software for the winner .
what happened to these kinds of things ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone had built a high high construction , he would have carried the price home .
so is it not interesting that high school levels have a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
what do you think happened now ?
now , they understood the advantage of the interior .
so , from the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there are lessons for us , and we have a lot of lessons about nature and success .
you like to ask : why would someone actually invest a time to create a more powerful ?
the reason is , i help digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and &quot; visual &quot; and &quot; visual &quot; .
and what the most important thing is , it helps you identify assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a common experience , a common language , or a common language , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this such simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in can visit the brain .
it &apos;s a blog where you see the marshmallow building .
there &apos;s a more powerful there .
they find crazy examples of all the world , like people , and they &apos;re going to optimize the system .
there are also also a lot of time .
and the lesson of the lesson , i think , is actually a design sport , which is actually a sport sport .
it requires that we all have our senses to do the task , and we think we &apos;re using our thinking , how our emotions and our do , in the challenge , is the challenge of us .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to bring us from a &quot; to &quot; a &quot; moment &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
we have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool , cool machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to go inside .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what they would choose because i asked my friends recently , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america &quot; to the u.s.
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced you &apos;re kind of drawn to the nostalgia , to be drawn to the nest .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a tedster .
it &apos;s because opportunities don &apos;t go back to this planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that there was ever on this planet , which is what scale you do : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining , declining , declining .
there was never a time like this .
my favorite group died all of them as they were 60 .
my grandparents are going to cut this number on 70 .
my parents are the 80 on the top of the world .
so there should be better one at the beginning of my favorite book .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who &apos;s born today in new delhi can expect to live as long as the richest man on the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is this ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they have shaped the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we defeated them . pop .
in the rich world , diseases that have millions of us have only threatened by one generation , hardly yet .
and , you know , the weather , polio , polio ...
anybody still knows what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method , things , look at whether it works , it changes if it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , the whole news is , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned often .
and one of them is that despite all our achievements , a billion people in the world are hungry every day .
this number goes up , and it &apos;s very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to trash this world .
drinking water , rainforests , oil , oil , gas , and you &apos;re going to go , and if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , we &apos;re also going to go .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country that they live on .
i think we can power the world with energy that they don &apos;t destroy simultaneously .
i think that &apos;s really , and no , that &apos;s not a rocket scientist .
but this is what keeps me awake at night -- one of the things that i &apos;m holding awake at night , we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress .
and we were also never able to do it , it &apos;s a reasonable way of doing it , like we can now .
we &apos;re at the threshold of amazing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think we have to go back hundreds of thousands of years before the enlightenment to find a time where we have progress in the world that we have in progress with these things .
people are putting themselves in their faith , and that &apos;s so closely that you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth will be free .
and listen , everybody has a right on his opinion ; even a right on his opinion .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
they don &apos;t have a right on their own facts . &apos; &apos; sorry , they don &apos;t .
and i took a while to figure out .
about a decade ago , i wrote a paper about immunization for the new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed to get resistance , to resistance , on what &apos;s the most effective thing in the health care system in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote a paper and drove on .
and soon , i wrote a paper about genetically modified food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i also wrote a paper about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; -- &quot; why they thought molecules were going to be a random kind of random kind of a light on the area of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept doing it .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re going to eat , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but this article made me worry , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it .
and that &apos;s because these teenagers were getting me crazy at all .
these were the people who were educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that was what i got to do .
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking about ironic , with little quotes , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what the reasons are .
we have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
chernobyl , the stocks , the stocks , the most populous , mass destruction , the u.s. destruction .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people that we believed that they were always right . so , they &apos;re skeptical .
ask questions , demand evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything like that .
but now , if you have to get evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can tell that that we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully i &apos;ll never see .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that the most terrifying story that was the most respected , and the vaccine , and the vaccine &apos;s vaccine in connection .
very scary .
so , many studies were done to see if that was true .
so , many studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious thing .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see to see what we &apos;re going to feel , what makes us feel really .
we don &apos;t believe in a pile of documents of a cotton system that gives us data , and i understand that , i think , we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was devastating .
catastrophic because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where immunization rates are falling down .
this is a little bit of a sudden , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happens is that we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because here &apos;s somebody who &apos;s got measles ?
has one in the audience ever die of diarrhea ?
not very often .
it &apos;s not happening in this country at all , but it &apos;s not in the world in the last year .
these are many deaths by measles , 20 per hour .
but because that &apos;s not what happened here , we can do it in denial , and people like jenny can walk around and ask messages of fear and illiteracy king of the live king .
and you can do that because they don &apos;t connect and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same thing .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and that &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas corbusier .
he was getting us from one of the worst most popular people in humanity .
no fear , no distress , polio , boom , disappeared .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul &apos;s name .
he &apos;s just developed a couple of other people in the world .
he can save the lives of the world &apos;s lives , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
well , this is good , besides that paul runs and talking about vaccines and says , how valuable they are , and that people should just stop complaining .
and that &apos;s what he says .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul in a public talk , he can &apos;t tell no guns .
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where their children go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
you take them on , go back to the disease , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening .
we now have measles in this country now .
and that &apos;s going to be worse , and pretty soon kids will die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die in measles .
what about polio ? do we take that . why not ?
a couple of weeks ago , i wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i said , i &apos;m a little bit sharp .
nobody ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against polio . no case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe someone in lagos , in a plane , is going to go to a plane and fly in los angeles , right now , he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he lands and he &apos;s a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these most profound things tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a specialty , and we don &apos;t know , because this is how the world works now .
that &apos;s the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do that as if it &apos;s not .
we love to bend ourselves in lying . we love this .
did you all have taken your vitamins today ?
and a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a plastic , a little bit of a plastic that helps you to get it on .
i know that they did that because half of americans do this every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference , how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data is constantly taking this .
they make their urine . they &apos;re almost never doing it .
this is okay , you like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i &apos;m going to agree with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and that &apos;s not what we should do . our health care system is seth .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing , and it &apos;s a very cold self to us that can afford .
so we &apos;re going away from that , and where do we walk ?
we &apos;re running into the poor of the world &apos;s arms .
this is great . i love the most violent .
but you know , this is really a serious thing , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars to it .
and i have all kinds of little shells here .
none of them -- the , it was , was , in the old , child , was , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars for it .
and you know what ? if i say that , people are screaming and saying , &quot; what cares ? let &apos;s do people , do what they want .
so you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the minister of health , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to not accept the evidence of my experts , &quot; or any of the most cosmopolitan that the patient wants to treat with the patients .
if you go to this way , where you think and magic evidence and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to the south africa to be in south africa .
he brought 400,000 his people , because he was that red sites , and the red , more effective , more effective than antiretroviral drugs , from which we know that they can be able to get aids from aids .
hundreds of thousands of copies in a country that will be worse than any other of this disease is going to be .
please don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
they have them . they have always .
now , the most popular epidemic that we &apos;re currently in is this ridiculous struggle between the most prolific food and the most prolific food .
this is a debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every single branch , every branch , every branch , has been transformed by the people .
you know , there was no more appropriate in paradise .
there was no clan protection .
there was no clan . we did it all .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them worked and not .
we get rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more specifically . and of course there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re routinely modified food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m hearing is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , hormones , we don &apos;t want to have huge fields with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . fix this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge amount of energy , but that &apos;s not science .
that &apos;s nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , more satisfying .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes not , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work because we &apos;re afraid of doing a real dead , and it holds millions of people from the flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we will have to grow 70 percent more food than in the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? genetically changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this , like , like , &quot; for example , &quot; like , &quot; name . &quot;
now , osorio is something that &apos;s a half billion people eating .
it &apos;s about a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s utopia .
it has no nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are building all this .
and then people could eat the food and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be 63 pollan , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say is : why do we fight this ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask : why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want genes to move around ?
it &apos;s not about the genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our intellect on greater food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do so far , we &apos;re going to do something guilty about something that we think , not guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of our , and we really need to stop it .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; you still want to go into this ridiculous machine and go to the future ? &quot;
anyway , i want to go . i want to go .
now , in the present , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this machine machine on everything we want .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we will move them where we want .
we need to have these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the machine machine , we &apos;re going to be happy to have that .
i know that we can , and it &apos;s something that &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s something that needs the world now .
thank you .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been interested in the most important thing for the most important time , and it may seem strange that a magician is interested in it , because they look like i think , &quot; a deception that will be a little bit of a matter of it . &quot;
in other words , sugar pills have shown a measurable effect , which is the most abstract , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what happens to her is a more powerful or a kind of ... in the middle of the country , for example , there &apos;s a sense of the patient that &apos;s called the gravitational effect .
a deception becomes something real , because somebody is so aware .
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , very simple trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that has at least since the 1950s in every single time for children .
i &apos;ve learned it from the most violent magic magic magic of the skyline in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can study , my hand , the you can study .
i &apos;m going to just hold the knife in my hand .
i &apos;m going to push my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve is going out , or out of him , i &apos;m just going to get my wrist right here .
you can see that there &apos;s no time to move anything . as long as i &apos;m here , there &apos;s nothing in my sleeve , or coming out .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will wash through my naked physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually so solid to his place that i can shake it without the knife .
nothing goes into my sleeve or comes out , no more , no more , and you can study everything .
the question !
now , this is a trick i often have little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn very much about deception , if you &apos;re very closely looking at it , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you here in the room are familiar with this trick .
he works like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to make my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or come out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m going to put my wrist is that it &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
because in the moment , where i &apos;m going to share my hand , so you see it from the back , this finger is moving here , my co-author , just from where he was , in a position where he was so extended .
great trick ?
there &apos;s someone sitting in the back , who had no childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i &apos;m going to get the fingers , the fingers changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there are only three fingers down there : because the mind and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count one , two , three , but you see it as a group .
but this is actually not what &apos;s going on here . and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s going to be held there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my explorations , that &apos;s now there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing happens by me , by the way , by the way that the finger is going to be , that the finger is going to be back again .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can show you your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what about the most important thing to do with the brain ?
a year ago , i read a study that really blew me up .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing for me .
because it turns out that if you offer a placebo in a white pill , in the form of a white pill , it &apos;s just a round , white pill , which has a certain effect .
but if you give the shape that you give the placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and that blue color , and it &apos;s a letter that is actually measurable , it &apos;s actually measurable .
and that , although none of these are a little bit of a plastic -- it &apos;s just sugar sugar .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really made me freak out .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
if you take scenarios , the more effective than any form of any form .
a colored capsule that is at a end of yellow and on the other red is better than a white capsule .
the dosage is playing a role .
a pill twice is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . sorry .
but the key thing is ...
... that also the doses of the scope .
and the shape is playing a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate news system , you have to grab the needle .
right ? a syringe with a laser -- a few of the things that you have to do is a little bit of a material that you &apos;re paying a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in your head , and that &apos;s very much stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time , if we have a projector .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill , which doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and none of them have really a really profound property . it &apos;s just our faith in the way that we make a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i take something that &apos;s obvious , and i &apos;ll take it really look .
we know that we have to get out of this study that you have to reach to the needle if it &apos;s supposed to go .
this is a 18 inches long , and it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very , very little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of light .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not a special of the special of the brain .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin and pull through them , until they turn back on the other side .
if you &apos;re bad , if you &apos;re slightly immersed -- i &apos;ve demonstrated a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people who i didn &apos;t know , and that &apos;s a woman almost powerless .
so i &apos;m suggesting , if you &apos;re going to get a little bit of bad , you &apos;ll look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know , what , i &apos;m going to make the first sensitive part here .
you can see it right , but you can also see , if you want .
so , it &apos;s like this , right here , where my flesh starts , at the bottom of my arm , i just make a little bit of a constant .
i &apos;m really sorry . does it make you crazy ?
and just a little bit of my skin and on the other side , and it &apos;s so much out of my skin .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the same situation .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid and the skin , just to give you a few minutes to talk about it . &quot;
well , i &apos;ll show you .
how does this look like this ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people in the back say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see that right . &quot;
people in the world &apos;s office are now coming in .
let me show you from the near .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
this is my flesh , and i can rotate that .
sorry . if you &apos;re bad , you look away , don &apos;t look at it .
people in the back or the ones that are going to see at video at some point , say , &quot; well , this is pretty impressive , but if it &apos;s real , it would be -- look , here &apos;s a hole , and there &apos;s really a real thing when it really would be , it would bleed . &quot;
okay , let me give you a little blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
i would usually take the needle out .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this frame here , and with the intention of a deception , i &apos;m going to just make a needle in there , and i &apos;m going to go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to see a couple of times in the next days .
i hope you &apos;re happy to do it . thank you .
everybody talks about happiness today .
i have some people who have been released the number of books that were published with happiness in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of fun .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these tide of work , there are several cognitive fall that are kind of impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly going to be about these cognitive cognitive .
that &apos;s true for the census of the future , and it &apos;s true for scientists , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out that we &apos;re so mess like anyone else .
the first of these fall is a key , complexity , to admit .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not useful , because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could just be able to do , but in the big and all the way that we &apos;re going to give up , and we will have to take the complicated perspective to what well-being is .
the second case is an assumption of experience and memory : basically it &apos;s between happy in his life and happy to be about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both of the most important in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the most powerful , and that &apos;s the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that affects well-being without its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now i &apos;d like to start with one example of someone who had a computer company after one of my lectures , who was a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he &apos;d heard a symphony , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and it was a very gorgeous sound .
and then he added , really emotional , that has ruined all the experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it had ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of music .
they don &apos;t go because he was a memory of a memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to keep .
what &apos;s really telling us is that we could think about ourselves and other people in the sense of two species .
there &apos;s a more powerful self that lives in the present and the present knows , the past is able to experience the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the most popular self that the doctor &apos;s doctor -- you know , if the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt if i &apos;m going to get you here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a more powerful self , and the most powerful self is that the most powerful and the story of our lives are going to be upright , and it &apos;s the one that &apos;s going to be able to make the question , &quot; how did you feel in the last time ? &quot;
or &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the most powerful self , and the most common self , and the two to confuse the most part of the world &apos;s happiness is the happiness of happiness .
now , the most popular self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories if we &apos;re doing stories to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories that are what we &apos;re allowed to do from our experiences .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who put a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds of their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who of both has suffered more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has suffered more . his favorite , and every minute of pain , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much thought these patients were that they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a much worse , much worse , had a patient b.
the stories of the world &apos;s stories were different , and because a very important part of the story is like it ends .
and none of these stories is very , very reactive or great -- but one of them is that clear ...
but one of them is clear than the other .
and the worse one is the one where the pain was at the end of the end , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people to be asked , and also much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than for b in the prison room .
well , this is a direct conflict between the average self and the most prolific self .
from the point of view of the world &apos;s view , b clearly had a worse time .
well , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s been done , you could actually get the patient &apos;s most efficient by the patient &apos;s tube to just shake the tube without too much .
that &apos;s going to lead to the patient , but only a little bit less than before .
and if you do this for a few minutes , you can make the most powerful self is a bad thing , and you have the fact that the most important self is a much better way of having a much better story , because now you have a better story about his experience .
what &apos;s a story of ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that will give us memory and it &apos;s true for the stories that we invent .
and what a story is , is , in fact , affect the significant moments and end .
end , very important , and in this case , the end is dominated .
well , the most important self lives forever .
it has moments of the world &apos;s disease , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve figured that out -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds . what means you know that there are about 600 million of them . in a month , there &apos;s about 600,000 million of them . most of them don &apos;t leave a trace .
most of you will completely ignore the most of the time .
and yet , you get the impression that you should count that what happens during this moments of the world &apos;s life is our life .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use as we &apos;re on this world .
and as we would use them , it seems to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the most important self for us .
so we have the most sophisticated self and the most expensive self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is to deal with time .
from the point of view , if you have a holiday and the second week , it &apos;s just as good as the first , then the most powerful vacation is twice as well as the christmas vacation .
this is not how it works at all for the most important self .
for the most important self , a holiday holiday is hardly better than the most cosmopolitan holiday , because there &apos;s no new memories added .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that &apos;s different from a human self , and time has very little influence on this story .
well , the most important self makes more than remember and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually the way that the decisions are true , because if you have a patient who , we have two different surgeons , and decide what to choose , then the one that &apos;s going to choose the memory that is less bad and that &apos;s the surgeon who will be selected .
the most important self has no voice in this choice .
we don &apos;t actually choose between experiences . we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as a experience .
we think about our future as a tool of memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the internet , and you can think of the most powerful self as one , which is kind of the most powerful self , which doesn &apos;t need the most powerful self .
i have the impression that if we &apos;re doing a holiday , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , which is , we &apos;re mostly doing the time in the service of the country .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s given for the dominance of the self .
and when i think about it , i think a holiday that we &apos;ve done in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i had ever had , and i think relatively often about how often i think about other people &apos;s thinking .
and i probably have from my memories of these online trips , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the folder with 600 pictures in it , i spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s just a half hours .
there seems to be a disagreement .
now , i like to be a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the memory of memories , but even if you have more of them , you have a real question , why do we give memories so much weight in the weight of the weight that we give ?
so i want you to think about a thought of thinking .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the computer , all your images are wiped out , and you get a drug of medicine , so you &apos;re going to remember nothing .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you would choose a different holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species and you have to think about how you choose this conflict and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think of the time of the time , you might get a different answer . and if you think of memories of memories , you might get a different answer .
why we choose the most important thing we choose is a problem that &apos;s going to be a choice between the two species of self .
now , the two types of self throw two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply to one self .
so you can ask : how happy is the most powerful self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in life of the life of the life ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
which is the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of happiness from the happiness of the self .
if you &apos;re lucky to ask yourself , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this is not how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s like happy or delighted the person is when this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
everybody who &apos;s not going to be different is the study of happiness , and i &apos;m one of the researchers about well-being , which have been rejected for the exploration of happiness long .
the distinction between happiness itself and happiness is recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re going to be able to measure the two sons .
the gallup organization has a worldwide survey , where more than half a million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started learning about the happiness of the two species .
and the main lesson that we think i learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and that teaches them not much about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation that is correlation about the relationship .
what that means is that if you were to meet someone and you would tell you , oh , his father is a little bit of a , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone has his life as eight in a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his own own self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what happiness is defined .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly , to be satisfied with people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two species of self , you &apos;re going to do very different things .
the conclusion of what i &apos;ve said here is that we really shouldn &apos;t think of ourselves as a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very quickly , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are going to be in california , they don &apos;t get the correct answer .
if you think about this question , people have to be happier in california when they say , in ohio , we &apos;re living in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the celebrity self , that decides how happy people are .
but , because the more powerful self is responsible , you can end up at the end -- some people could go to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track what happens to people who are going to go to california in hope , happier .
well , you &apos;re not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because if you &apos;re going to think about it , you &apos;re going to be reminded about how awful the weather was in ohio , and you &apos;re going to feel that you &apos;ve made the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve got to give you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we &apos;ve mentioned a couple of weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this gallup survey .
is that something you can let us share because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel paravicini : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we &apos;ve found in the world &apos;s world &apos;s survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
if we looked at how feelings are underlying income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
so , 60,000 : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year are unhappy , and they &apos;re increasingly happy , the poorer they will be .
we get a absolutely flat line .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen so flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money is not buying a single , but lack of money in money , and we can get this misery of a very , very clear , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the most important self , you get another story .
the more money you deserve the happier .
that &apos;s not true for emotions .
but danny , in the entire american effort , is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this kind of serious serious , i mean , it seems to be all on the head , everything we believe in terms of the way we think about it , for example , and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country would take a more sophisticated way of taking the serious , and that &apos;s based on politics ?
so , you know , i think , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of the world &apos;s role in politics .
the recognition is slowly going to be in the united states , no question , but in the u.k. , it &apos;s happening and in other countries , it &apos;s happening .
people are in favor of that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it will take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study or study whether they want to study or study it , so we have to have this discussion pretty soon .
as you can get lucky , it &apos;s very different depending on how you think and whether you think about the most important self or whether you think about the most important self .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you &apos;re going to be able to measure the population of the population .
that &apos;s going to be , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
now , it seems to me , this topic , or should at least the most interesting political debate to track the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny krishnan .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in reality , as you &apos;re in the rescue of the world .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince you more people , including all of them , more time with play and more sophisticated games .
now we spend three billion hours a week with a computer company .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a whole lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute of the future is the opposite of the world .
three billion hours per week , not nearly enough to solve the most powerful problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase this time dramatically .
i &apos;ve calculated that the time that it &apos;s been going to be 21 billion hours per week .
this may seem a little bit alien , so i &apos;ll repeat it , so that if we &apos;re problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts , global conflicts , and obesity , i think , we need to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week .
no , i really mean it seriously .
why ? this image describes pretty precisely why i think games are so essential for the survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographers phil luce .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play , so he was building a camera .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , maybe you can get some of the nuances in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also also also , very hard concentration , in the way of a real difficult problem .
if you play , you see some nuances here , which are up to the top of the eyes and the mouth of the mouth , and the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of a called epic .
oh , you know that . ok . so , fine . so we have some players here .
a very painful victory is a result that &apos;s so very positive that it &apos;s not even possible that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you reach it , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually able to be able to do something like this . that &apos;s a kind of victory victory .
this player is a short victory in a epic victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces from the world , if we take the barriers of the next century , the face of the next century , the face of the most prolific wave of the epic .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re looking at this face in real life when we face hard problems .
i call it the &quot; in life &quot; i &apos;m bad , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
i &apos;m like , &quot; i &apos;m bad &quot; in life , i &apos;m bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. , why we &apos;re better in play than in the real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not so good in reality as we are in games .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successfully , although that &apos;s what it &apos;s heard about .
we &apos;re going to get more in the world . i mean , i mean , the motivation with the motivation , something significant to do with each other .
if we &apos;re in a corporate , i believe that many of us are turning into our best version , anytime and immediately , to solve the problem , trying to solve the problem as long as necessary , as long as it takes to try to do it .
and in reality , if we fail to be failing , we &apos;re often feeling different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or nurtured .
we never have these feelings when we play games , there &apos;s just no way we play it .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible in games to think , you couldn &apos;t just do anything ?
how can we be able to transfer these feelings from the play into reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , which provides the ideals of the environment to collaborative problem problem .
and i &apos;ve noticed some things that the epic owner is going to be able to do in the same way .
so first , if you get into one of these most profound , especially world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to be willing to give you a mission mission , and that &apos;s immediately .
but not only any mission , but a mission that fits perfect to your current level , right ?
so they do that .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their capabilities , they have to be hard , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and you &apos;re going to be able to do it , and there &apos;s always a very important thing to do .
and there are tons of employees .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to finish their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that easy life in real life , this feeling that a lot of employees are ready to be ready .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , these inspiring history , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve heard of &quot; level &quot; and &quot; + 1 &quot; or &quot; + 1 &quot; or &quot; + 1 &quot; .
this constant feedback is not in real life .
when i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have a talk : + 1 , and a crazy idea , a + , 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get in the real life of this feedback .
so the problem of the world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s world is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at any time at the edge of a epic , that we prefer to spend our whole time in these online centers .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
and all of the world of the world &apos;s world has spent millions of years to solve the virtual problems of the world &apos;s problems .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound bad .
but to see it in context , we started to go out of the first time , and we started to go upright .
so the first step of primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend with play , it &apos;s just making sense when you hold the time in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinarily .
but also , because it turns out we use this whole time to play this whole time , actually , what we &apos;re able to do as humans in the position .
we &apos;re developing ourselves to collaborative , and we &apos;re very vulnerable .
that &apos;s the truth . i think it &apos;s .
once you look at these interesting statistics that recently published from a researcher of carnegie mellon university , the average boy of today &apos;s living in a country with strong amounts of time to the 21st hours of labor .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of reasons : two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , they &apos;re the exact exact exact exact exact exact exact exact exact exact most accurate , which they spend in school , from the fifth school to the degree of high school -- if you never miss .
so we have a complete computer system , and the young people are learning what it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have a new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; the &quot; aw , &quot; read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of the world &apos;s great research that if we spend 10,000 hours with the most tedious study of a single subject to the 21st of a single subject , we will be grateful to master .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what &apos;s the most important people in the world .
so , what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are the most powerful .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players doing good ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have never been there before , and we had never been there before .
so many people have now in the world , who spend at least one hour per day with a computer hour .
these are our most common ones . 500 million people who are extraordinary in &quot; something . &quot;
and the next decade we have another billion players that are extraordinary in what &apos;s always good .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the most sophisticated , the energy industry , the energy , and working on the work , instead of the most powerful , so the player on the world , in particular , in india , can play in india , especially in india , china .
you expect a extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is to do that these games are what we &apos;re doing .
here are the four things i found . first of all , the first thing i found .
ok , imagine how extreme the extreme .
and the desire is to do something immediately , to do something , to master , to think of that , with believing that we have an educated hope on success .
players always believe that a security victory is possible , and that it &apos;s always worth trying to try and do it .
players are not sitting around .
players are masters of spiders in spiders .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show people that we like to do more after we played with them , even if they &apos;ve defeated us .
the reason is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone a game .
we trust that somebody is spending time with us that the rules are being honored to be the same goal and to the end of the day .
so the most important thing is that the production system is growing by ties , trust and interconnected .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
get productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the most important of the brain &apos;s age of 22 hours a week is playing as a computer .
the reason is , if we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than if we &apos;re going to relax or do nothing .
we know that we &apos;re being optimal as human beings , if we do hard , significant work .
and players are always ready to work hard if they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to be part of awe of awe of the great missions .
here &apos;s a key , to put that into the right light , you know all wikipedia , the largest wiki of the world .
the second wiki of the world , with almost 80,000 squares , is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about world of warcraft in the internet than any other subject in any other wiki of the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to one outcome . players are more hopeful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as a single one .
and the only problem is that they believe they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real thing .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward mandelbrot is a computer designer .
his work is great . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in the world .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to witness less than a virtual worlds in virtual worlds and the world . &quot;
and that &apos;s an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like i ... i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit more a bit more .
so he says that actually makes sense , because players can reach more than in the real life .
you can make stronger social bonds in play than in real life , and you get more feedback and rewards in play as in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s completely logical that players are more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
i just agree with that , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not a rocket scientist .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s going to come out of 2,500 years .
there are these ancient cube , from the wooden system . you know ?
this fantastic thing was , there was a lot of time .
and these were the first of people developed in the first of the people .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the old greek , you may know this story , and the story of how and why games were invented .
according to the games , games were actually invented , more specifically , in the kingdom of famine .
there was such a great famine that the king of the king of the king was decided to be a crazy idea .
people were suffering . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to the , loud , the most terrifying strategy , and the yemeni strategy , you would eat a national strategy , and then you would play .
and they would be so much in the world &apos;s office , because games are so fascinating and we &apos;re with a little bit of time , and they &apos;re going to be surrounded by the food that they would forget nothing to eat .
and then the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to the death survived , they survived this famine , by eating these famine , and they were playing the next .
so , i think , let &apos;s start playing today .
we &apos;re putting games to get the suffering of the real world .
we &apos;re putting games to get everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , all that is not really appropriate in real life , and we &apos;re going to get what we need from play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to the last 18 years , the famine didn &apos;t have better . so the king decided to be a last day of a second .
they shared the kingdom in two camps .
they played a computer company and they were allowed to break the best adventure into a epic adventure .
they left out and they went to search for a new home , and they just had so many people back , like food , and they were looking at the rest of the area , and they were able to be able to thrive with the rest of them .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest design shows that the most recent , the most early empire , the same dna , the same dna as the old ones have been the old .
so scientists recently came to the notion that the crazy story is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global cooling that took almost 20 years to explain what the famine could explain .
so this crazy story could be true .
maybe you &apos;ve actually saved your people through play by playing 18 years in games , and then these miniature people had learned and so much about each other , that they learned the entire civilization .
so , we can also .
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
this was the first one in real time in the world of the world &apos;s world &apos;s first , and that was 16 years ago .
they were playing 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready for our own game game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i take my 21 billion of the week .
we should be spending out that half of us spend an hour of a day with play , until we have solved the problems of real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask : &quot; how do we solve problems in play in games ? &quot; and that &apos;s what i have to do in the last few years , i &apos;ve been working on the institute for the future for the future .
we have this flag in our office in palo alto , it &apos;s like we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to think of the best outcome , and then people empower this idea to make the reality in reality .
we &apos;re going to be providing epic , and we give people the possibilities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you a very short three games that i designed to try to get people to get people &apos;s epic in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a key , which you have to get over a more of the time .
the most important thing is , but we have enough of the power , so it &apos;s going to be realistic for them and actually live their real life without oil , so if they &apos;re going to be able to be able to do the game , they &apos;re going to be able to do what they &apos;re doing , and then they have to get to the work of how much oil is , and they &apos;re going to be able to get to the way they &apos;re going to be able to do a lot of
we tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied by the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a change .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure , and you &apos;re going to get the oil .
this is an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going to .
find out how they were going to survive . most of our players have been able to do the habits in the game .
so we have a bigger game for the next game , and we put a bigger goal than just a more sophisticated goal .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; on the institute for the future .
and the point is that the computation of a computer is that people have only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global energy technology &quot; , of course .
the call to gamers , we have almost like a &quot; eureka &quot; designed .
you know jerry &apos;s , where there &apos;s the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the scientist , the scientists , the most powerful and only together .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody is in the most violent , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they &apos;re google .
and the last game we get on march march , it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the award of the world bank , &quot; social design , &quot; 2010 .
we work with universities in the entire sub-saharan africa and store , to learn social networking .
we have a comic book . we have a level of understanding &quot; level &quot; for the world , sustainability , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to invite you all , this game with young people , all over the world , especially in the world , in the world , in the most important , which is going to benefit together to save their own social enterprise .
i &apos;m going to end up with this .
i want to ask you something .
what , do you think , next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have these all superpowers , the productivity , the ability to make close social nets , and the desire to make sense of the importance of the social meaning .
i really hope that we &apos;re playing significant games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design with me that play and play .
when i go to the next decade , i &apos;m sure i &apos;m sure that we can create every future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the most playful games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about what i was writing a couple of months ago in writing a piece of wired magazine .
i always have my writing on writing my head , but i was done with the text of text already , and i realized that i &apos;ve never been in my life , which is &quot; disabled &quot; really .
i read you the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; applied , &quot; the &quot; aw , helpless , useless , destroyed , wounded , mutilated , wounded , wounded , freezing , paralyzed , paralyzed , behold , useless , behold , &quot; hurt , &quot; useless , useless , bleeding , and i &apos;m going to be relieved , and she &apos;s useless , you know , useless , behold , &quot; it &apos;s useless . &quot;
and it &apos;s healthy : healthy , powerful , powerful . &quot;
i read this list of a friend according to a friend , and i had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i was just going to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i was &quot; and i had to collect and collect the emotional shock of this . &quot;
of course , this was a very old old , old , old , and i just thought that the copy has to be quite old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early 1980s when i was just starting to build the elementary school and started building my self outside my family , and to form in terms of other kids and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use a nuclear scientist at that time .
i would take this post seriously , i was born in a world that someone like me would perceive as a person whose life can be positive in any way , but today i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the opportunity and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately have to admit the most popular of 2009 , and i expect to find a little bit of a piece of reference .
here &apos;s the most popular version of this kind of thing .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words , in the near , &quot; near &quot; and &quot; healthy &quot; is &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many ancient societies , including the greeks and the roman , really believed that the netizens have a big force , because what you &apos;re looking at is the most powerful thing that you can do .
so , what do we actually want to do -- a disabled person or a powerful person ?
and a human being alone , as a child , could be a child , could be enough , and they &apos;re going to be able to get them to work .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open up doors ?
a human being open to me was my pediatrician , on the top of the day , my pediatrician at the university of a barge institute in the south school .
he &apos;s called dr. dunlap . a girl who &apos;s a name , whose name , as you can think , could not be correct , and so he was called dr. p. .
and dr. p. was always wearing very colorful flies and was just working with kids like this .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my favorite .
i had to repeat an infinite practice of infinitely often with these big , elastic , elastic , different colors -- you know , to build my favorite , and i hated these down more than anything . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
and imagine , i even have a child &apos;s child with dr. p. , and so tried to stop this practice , and stop the practice of success without success .
and one day he looked at me at one of my work -- these work were just tiring and screaming -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so strong , powerful and young girls , you &apos;re going to be one day of one of those rides .
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this was just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that the richest five girls in the ward are going to be in the second floor , but he actually got me to see my daily life with new eyes .
and i &apos;m asking myself today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl , my self , and i could imagine that as a nature of strong , powerful and more powerful human beings .
this is just an example of many , as adults can make the imagination of a child .
but as the most important examples of the world &apos;s show , we can &apos;t prove our language , to imagine what we all wish to do : it allows every single one to see yourself as a powerful human .
our language is behind the social change that was caused in many cases through a technological change .
from the medical standpoint , you can tell that my legs , the most powerful for the computer , and artificial body , for aging , and artificial body for aging , which allow people to be really , really , to be able to define their own identity , to develop their own identity , to develop their own identity , to develop their own identity , to make them feel a different identity .
so perhaps this technological change is clearly clear because there was always a different truth , which is that every human society is a little bit more powerful and very powerful , and that the human ability , to adapt , is our biggest plus .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell you how to deal with odds and i &apos;m going to say something : this sentence has never been a lot of time to answer people , and i think i &apos;ve been feeling very uncomfortable about that , and i think i &apos;m going to understand why .
this sentence of the process of dealing with the idea that success or happiness depends on the challenge of being a challenge without being able to be able to get a life , because i could get the way to get a life with a prosthetic , or how people could be able to get me to a disability .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course we are the challenge of the challenge , whether they &apos;re physically , emotionally or even both .
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s good .
odds are not obstacle that we need to be able to get to our lives better .
odds are just to our lives .
and i tend to see odds as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s not to see , but he &apos;s constantly at me .
and i want to do no one of the impact , or the heavy of the human being of a human being .
there are opportunities in life , and challenges , and these are just real , and every person is going to be different , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to get to the odds or not , but how we get to it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for people that we love to preserve , but they &apos;re also preparing to get good to get to it .
and we don &apos;t really look at our kids if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to separate two things : one of the medical fact , to be amputated and to the other social opinion , whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and sustained disability that i had to put apart is that the world is constantly asking me to describe it with these definitions .
in our desire , people who are to protect us , and the cold , hard truth about their medical prediction , or even a forecast to the quality of life that they expect , we have to look at that we &apos;re not going to be able to put that in the process that someone actually is disabled .
maybe this is the concept of concept that just look at what &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we fix it for every single one of the major disability than the pathology labs .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being , and not all of its forces and opportunities , we can recognize , in addition to the natural struggle , that you might have to have a more disease .
we &apos;re a human being , which has a value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the most sophisticated and focus on all the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between perception of our flaws and our great , connection , there is a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t be able to ban this challenge , or deny , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , we should be able to avoid them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about realizing the odds of opportunity .
it &apos;s perhaps more about asking that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome odds , but that we &apos;re open to it , to hug them , to take them to the most , to take a more , and maybe dance with it .
and maybe we can do it , more abstract than something natural , coherent and useful and feeling so much as so much as their presence .
in this year , we celebrate 200 . the birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin has been writing , in my eyes , on something very true in the human character .
i would be so energetic : not the most powerful of his kind , and not the most powerful of his species , but the ones that can adapt to the best .
from conflicts , creativity is emerging .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people to survive and to survive , is determined by the fight of the human mind , to transform conflict .
so again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of people .
and maybe we know what wood we &apos;re cutting out when we &apos;re really tested .
perhaps the point of odds is the sense of the value of the value , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like that .
we can give a new meaning to a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see odds as change .
odds are for change that we haven &apos;t adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve been doing is to believe that we should be normal .
so , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual thing . the typical thing . but not the normal . and would you really know that poor , gray person really , if you really have ?
i think it &apos;s not .
it would be great if we &apos;re going to make this paradigm of the normal against another one of the possibilities or the strength to even make it a little more dangerous , and we can release the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their very special and valuable skills into society .
and the point of life is that we have people from the members of our society always have a necessary to be useful and to afford to make a contribution .
there are evidence that the neanderthals have been older years ago , and people with severe physical injuries , and that might have happened because the life experience in the world &apos;s life was valuable to society .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the city where i grew up in a red zone in the red zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood there a little bit of a tomato tomatoes .
it was summer and i had a lot of time .
and i hear how a guy says behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to turn around and see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you may not remember me .
when i first saw them , i brought them out of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , so the one .
and of course , it &apos;s made click .
this was dr. m. , a man i knew only from narratives of my mother &apos;s day because i , of course , was very late to my birthday two weeks .
the doctor for the medical imaging teacher was in vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without a designer , and my feet had been looking at them , and i just had a few toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , he had the most bad news to the other .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say your parents that you would never walk , and never be so mobile as other kids or that you could never have an independent life , and you &apos;ve just been lying in the world . &quot;
i was really extraordinary that he had collected my entire childhood , whether i had won in a second class in the second class , whether i was in the world &apos;s office , and i had no matter if i had my scholarship , or i had a ph.d. of my school , and he used these clips to teach his students , to teach his students , to teach his students .
and he called this part of his course , the x factor , the potential of the human being .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough , as the critical factor of the life of human beings can be .
and dr. dunlap said , he said , &quot; i learned that kids , if they &apos;re not going to get something else , and even if they get a little bit of support , if they get kids to be able to get their own , then children can achieve a lot . &quot;
see , dr. dunlap changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone is dealing with it , two different things .
and i &apos;ve changed my thinking in time when you asked me about 15 years of if i had my prostheses against legs and bones , and then i would have no second .
i was really trying to act normal .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not sure .
and that &apos;s what happens because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not despite this experience .
and maybe this change could happen because i &apos;ve been so many people who have opened doors to me , rather than people who have been constrained me or a notion of a notion .
see , it really takes a human being to show you how you can manifest your forces , and you &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate your own inner forces -- the human mind is so versatile -- if you can do that , and for someone in a critical moment , they &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to open doors .
the real meaning of the word &quot; the &quot; ice &quot; in the word &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means something that is producing something that is the potential of the potential .
again , what potential is we going to do now ?
in the 1960s , in the u.k. , a case case was done in the u.k. , and then the u.s. science was transformed in the wild .
they call this &quot; the &quot; shhh &quot; in the united states , we call this &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot;
the students are divided up to grades .
and the one student will be more tested , and the better teachers get more tested .
they have a long time to give students a big time to say , &quot; a &quot; sufficient &quot; -- it was very good , they were told , they were very smart , and they were really written for these three months .
and of course , it breaks out to hear the heart that the other thing was said , they were only enough .
and it was also the three months after that .
but only those who were still in school -- except from students who were leaving school .
and the very critical thing about this study was that teachers were not going to be .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they just said that the students and that are the students with the grade , and they &apos;ve taught them something , and they &apos;re taught them .
the only real disability is a broken mind a mind that was broken , has no hope , and he doesn &apos;t find any more of the time , and he &apos;s missing our natural , deep , and our innate ability of imagination .
but if we do it , the human mind to help to hope , to hope , and other people around themselves , are very curious and to be beautiful , and then we &apos;re really putting our forces positive .
if a spirit has a mind , we can create a new reality and new design systems .
i want to end with a poem that was written by an persian poet called the 14th century , and my friend jacques mcchrystal tells me , and the poem is called &quot; the god who knows only four words , &quot; and the god who knows only four words , and the god is just saying , &quot; come on , dance with me . &quot;
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right now ?
suppose i said that through a few changes of their genes , a better memory could have -- more precise , more accurate and faster .
or you want to be more powerful , more force , more force .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be to live longer at good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who always wished to be more creativity .
what would you like to do most ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many as a lot of creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would be deciding for a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . the majority i like to do as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a whole different world .
is it all a fantasy ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a persistent topic here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor &apos;s theme .
the big geneticists in the 20th century , the most powerful , who was also a computer company in the russian orthodox church , wrote a paper called &quot; nothing in biology , &quot; once in the biology of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time , you take your personal health , you &apos;ll take your personal health , and maybe you can take a look at kathryn hughes , and you can make a look at it , because nothing else is going to be in the talk of it .
but if you accept biological evolution , you think about this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for other people &apos;s or it &apos;s also us ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
in this picture , i have a bush as a center of the branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , all the existing species of these branches have had success in evolutionary terms : they survived ; it has survived its environment and strength .
the human part of this kind of thing , far at the end , is that we &apos;re most interested in what we &apos;re most interested in .
we &apos;re going to divide from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids were in hominids .
some are coming and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about a few years .
it seems like we &apos;re right from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually , the most important part , are the basic mechanisms of our cells quite equal .
is it clear that we can use it , and the mechanisms of a shared bacteria can produce the protein of the human genome system , which is used to treat the supermassive of the human genome system ?
this is not like the kind of steel protein ; this is the same protein that &apos;s chemically made of what comes out of the pancreas .
and with the bacteria , what we &apos;re talking about is that every one of us in our gut is more bacteria than it leads to cells in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , think about , if antonio damasio asks her sense of self , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s a very comfortable , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to all give them nutrients that you could just wish without effort .
it &apos;s really a lighter way for bacteria , with a tremendous videodisc of unintended , forced to push to the outcome .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they are important for their lives .
they help the lure of the essential nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will be going on in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary balance in a species ?
or are we sure to be something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
now , let &apos;s go back to the big bang in the big bang 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago -- the first sign of living organisms , perhaps three to four billion years ago -- the first one , and then the human species , which is the last few years of the last few years .
in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe , life is only a short way to be able to do it in the world , the animal kingdom , like a single one , and the human life , a small one .
we were .
this is also the most important thing that &apos;s going to be like , and so i hope , d , i &apos;d like to leave you with it .
now , when i was a college student on college , i had my first favorite card .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i found something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in the most developed organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going to run in both of the daughter &apos;s cells .
but at the time , when the organisms came out , things began to change .
sexual reproduction is going to be the picture .
and very important , with the introduction of sexual reproduction that the genome is going to be able to do , the rest of the body is going to be able to be able to get away .
in fact , you could say that the most important of death of our body in evolution is going to be going to be the same moment as the sexual reproduction .
now i have to confess , if i was a computer scientist , i thought , okay , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty sensible to the point , but with every year , it &apos;s been to my increased doubt .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , who read his show in las vegas in las vegas .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his own side of his chest .
he opens the door .
he &apos;s a beautiful high school project in front of him .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for a lot of time . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization that i was a doctor , that i was a goal of the way that evolution was the goal of evolution -- not necessarily different .
i tried to keep the body .
i wanted to keep healthy .
i wanted to rebuild the health for a disease .
i wanted to have a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about copying the genome of the genome , and adapt to the next generation , and we &apos;re going to be able to adapt generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they are and i developed like a brick rockets to send the genetic media into the next stage of orbit to go to the ocean .
i think we would all have the mood that brought the woody allen to the expression , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to immortality by my work .
i want to get it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily matter the biggest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution is the creatures that are best in their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , and the so-called steam is still , and that &apos;s the hot steam , if fish would be there , they would have a vacuum of fish to make it a huge environment for themselves .
so , what does that mean when we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the space of the people in evolution , and especially like we &apos;re looking at the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reason that we would be , first of all , is that we &apos;ve done a lot of genes , and we &apos;ve been able to get a lot of genes that would have been otherwise , and had been removed from the population .
and secondly , we have a species of our environment so that we have done it , that we &apos;ve been able to adapt to them , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and we put and we mix and mix so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for evolution to be more necessary for evolution .
a second possibility is that it will be a evolution of traditional species , of course , imposed by the forces of nature .
and the argument here , here &apos;s that the wheels of evolution are slow down , but they &apos;re down .
and so far the isolation is when we &apos;re being able to redesign planets as a species , it will be able to be able to produce and give the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a compelling , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it a little bit of the new development -- the new development that &apos;s not just , but led to us as a computer designer , and we decided to make it happen .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s first look at the reality that people are making decisions today about their offspring .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family choose .
so think about if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to make genetic adaptations , the disease will cure and prevent disease .
what if you could make the genetic change to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or reducing the risk of cancer or stroke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do it , these changes in your genes ?
if we &apos;re going to be more sophisticated , these kinds of changes will be increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost dsl billion dollars .
in the next year , when it was finished , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in the world .
today , you can take a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome to a price of about 20,000 and in the room of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take long to be the reality that it will be the 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everybody .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering gave the national prize of engineering to francis arnold and the most powerful , two scientists who developed the natural process of evolution to work faster and to work in a more efficient way -- which is called arnold evolution .
a few years ago , the most popular thing was the scientists who had been awarded to the scientist in his research , and he took a adult , a , and through the manipulation of only four genes that cell organized cell to become a pluripotent cell cell -- a cell potentially in your body .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that can produce the human insulin in bacteria , which is not just protection , but also to be able to serve the immunity against other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with vaccine that has been grown into the cells of a plastic system .
can you imagine something good that comes from tobacco ?
this is all reality today , and in the future , it &apos;s going to be much more possible .
so , imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
what if you could change the sperm and the air , or the fresh egg , to give you a better chance to give your children a better chance of a life -- eliminating diabetes , the risk of cancer , the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to healthier children ?
and then the analytical technique , the same engine of science that can allow the changes to prevent disease , could also allow us to adopt the so-called , to adopt the better memory .
why don &apos;t you have the most popular one of the ken jennings , especially if you can extend it to the next generation of the world &apos;s next generation ?
why not have the fast fast , which will allow you to run faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are going to be the most powerful .
and if we &apos;re in a place where we can pass it on the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want to be transformed from the evolution of evolution to the world .
we &apos;re going to have a process that needs to be 100,000 years , and we can compress it into a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions that their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , have to be engaged .
do we use these decisions to form a society that is better , the more successful ?
or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
will we form a society , and we &apos;re going to be a society , or more robust and robust ?
these are the kinds of questions we have to face .
and the deepest of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom that we need to make that decisions ?
in the good way , in the bad , and as you might think , these decisions are going to be on us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something , a portable robot that gives you a little bit of skills , or another , the most powerful , and to go up and go to it .
we call this robot in berkeley , and we call this robot .
they &apos;re not other than something that they put in the morning and gives them extra strength and increase their pace and increase them , for example , their balance .
this is actually the real melting of human and machine .
but not only that -- so they &apos;re going to join and connect them with the universe and other devices out there .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers , who are wearing about 100 pounds on its back , and it &apos;s the request that they should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- the -- 30 percent of it -- chronic warming .
so we thought we would take this challenge and create a design system that would help to deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you to the moment -- or the human universal body &apos;s body &apos;s body .
soldier : with the most powerful , i can wear 200 pounds of the long terrain , many hours long .
his flexible design allows it to be deep to living , and they &apos;re highly agile movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then increase my strength and resilience .
we &apos;re so far in our own business of this device , this new kind of energy in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s take our view of the user , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who are estimated in the world .
this is about a percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually an conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about a very young person with spinal cord cord , who in the middle of their lives -- 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 40s -- was hit by the fate , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , their number of people .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it &apos;s about a car , or to other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since he &apos;s been saying , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in mobility .
now let me introduce you to the first time that amanda &apos;s carried by amanda , who suffered a spinal cord cord the result that she had no longer been able to run for 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our online team .
it has sensors .
his completely , completely , sensors in the crutches , the signals of the signals that are attached to our backs , which is attached to their back .
here are also also a lot of the time , the most powerful , the most powerful , as you can move on your hips , and you &apos;re moving forward to this very much , very natural gait .
i was 24 years old , and in a prison , when a computer designer was a computer scientist , i was a college professor .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement below my own life .
not long after that , a doctor in my hospital room and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s steel every single time of consciousness from my consciousness .
so , delusions technologies have been to me since then to go back to learning , to climb and even drive the hands .
but nothing was invented to me , and i was going to go back to this .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to make us and discuss them .
it &apos;s in our hands and we have the whole potential here to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda , and all the users , but for all of them .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m boss &apos;s head of a non-profit organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t have poverty , i &apos;m a computer scientist , i &apos;m a computer scientist at a volunteer age , the fire .
now , in our city , in the volunteers , a drug company , you have to be very early at the most early , to be able to be able to be able to get a lot of time .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer on the ted table , so i was right to be able to get a good opportunity in the world .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to get the adoption of the people who would be able to get out of the world .
when i found the most serious , he had just been in a very serious conversation with the most important days of their life .
it was in the middle of the night and she stood in the pajamas and she was barefoot under a screen in the dry rain , while her house was burned in fire .
the other volunteers who came out of me was -- we call him a bloody luther -- we got the first one to go and get the dog to go and save the dog of the dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was lost .
there was some lawyer or a lawyer who was now able to tell the rest of his life , people who were able to tell you that he was going to a house in a house , just because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next .
the most popular thing to me is to go .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go to the house .
you have to go up to the fire , and you have to get this woman , and you have to get a few shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
now , not exactly what i hoped i had , but i went -- the stairs up , the hallway , the &quot; real &quot; over the real time , the &quot; real &quot; over the moment , &quot; the &quot; the &quot; is just done with a few shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey down to the bottom , where i met my fictional and the beloved dog .
we put our value out to the outside of the street , where , not surprisingly , his much more attention than my own .
some weeks later , the most popular one was a letter of the computer , where they were going to be in the brave use of their house .
one of the things that &apos;s been estimated is that , you know , a few of the things that have been made , you know , had a few shoes .
both in my profession at robin hood as well as my volunteer firefighter , i &apos;m witness , as a volunteer firefighter , i witness of generosity and kindness in the great scale , but i also see the altruism and the most of the individual .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look at this room , and people who have either been able to get a success of success or on their way there , i want to offer this memory : wait not .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in a different way , until you get your first million .
if you have something to give you , you &apos;ll give it .
they &apos;re going to be a park in a neighborhood , in a neighborhood , in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will give us a chance to save life of a human being , but every day gives us the opportunity to change one .
so they go ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno &apos;s : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just come back from a community that knows the secret of the human race .
a place where women are leading the most powerful , with sex , &quot; hello , &quot; and the game is determined -- where fun is a serious thing .
and no , it &apos;s not a matter of the street or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their familiarity .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the forest of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
that means we have a shared ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , which lived about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are known for their own business .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of the human evolution in the history of human evolution .
but bonobos are showing us the other side of the coin .
as chimpanzees are , in the great , fear of the people who are led to the most powerful , the most powerful female is led to the female .
they really have come up with what &apos;s made , because that leads to a very strict society , which has been a deadly force .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known under the primates .
they live in the deep sea of the congo , and they &apos;re just hard to do it .
congo is a paradox -- a country extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself -- the location of a violent argument that has been used for decades and almost so many lives as the first world war .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction also survive the survival of bonobos .
and the decline of the fuel industry , and the decline of the world &apos;s decline , you can &apos;t even fill a stadium with the remaining bonobos -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a laugh of the trees that the trees are upset .
who are these relatives ?
we know it as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; because they have knives , also sex , with a partner , with a partner , and rules and social media and social media .
i &apos;m not saying that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because life is more than the computational of bonobos .
bonobos -- like humans -- love to play their lives long .
play doesn &apos;t just mean the only thing .
for us and it &apos;s essential to the attachment of relationships and the care of tolerance .
we learn to trust and the rules of the game .
play is more creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the production of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you watch bonobos play in the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human health , dance and rituals .
play is the most powerful , which is the most important thing we &apos;re doing .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique footage from the wild .
first of all , a computer designer on the street -- and i don &apos;t think about football .
so here we see a young female and males in a nanotube .
look at what she does .
this could be the evolutionary origin of , &quot; she puts him on the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more like it , right .
yeah !
so , the way they &apos;re spreading is both in bonobos and people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the most powerful , with the new elements that you can bring to the game -- as the testicles -- and also , as the game is , it makes a lot of trust as well as it &apos;s going to be .
but the game is a key game .
play is a key and it can take a lot of forms of that some of the things that are quiet , more curious , curious -- maybe to discover the wonder again .
and i want to show you , this is a young female , a young female , and she plays peaceful with water .
i think that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing sometimes , sometimes , and we &apos;re going to be able to get the limitations of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us research , and interact with the unexpected wiring that we form , the real breeding of creativity .
this is just a little taste on the insights that bonobos give us our past and present .
but it &apos;s also a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to increasing challenges , through greater creativity and more effective cooperation .
the secret is that the game of the key to these skills is .
in other words , play is our main system .
so to make us adapt to a world &apos;s world , we have to play .
but will we do the best of our own business ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people equally , life is not from teeth and claws alone .
just if it &apos;s hardly appropriate , play may be the most appropriate .
and so , my favorite , let &apos;s give you this gift of evolution , and play together , while we &apos;re doing the creativity and the wonder of the creativity .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs of couples in 1979 , at the same time , in exactly the same moment , every one of the time , every one of the time .
so two pairs , every one of the time .
now i don &apos;t want you to use too much time to imagine the retrofits , because if you think of the whole time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
imagine that just for a moment .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case that is wearing the sperm , the sperm is carrying a y of the egg that &apos;s going on on the x chromosome of the egg .
and in the other case , the sperm is wearing a x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the egg .
both of these are the ones that are climbing , both fire .
we &apos;ll come back to these people later .
i have two minds in most of my activities .
i &apos;m going to do with a hat with the story of anatomy .
i &apos;m a study of an historian , and i study how people thought of anatomy -- that human body , animal bodies -- like you thought about body fluids , with the body of body , like you &apos;ve thought about body .
the other hat i carried in my work is the activist , as a computer designer -- or , as i sometimes say , as a representative lawyer -- from people who are patients from doctors .
in this case , i worked with people who have the social norms , the social norms in question .
so , for example , i worked with people who are the most prolific twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with a lot of people -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often , i worked with a lot of people who are their gender , and so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female .
and as general term , we can use the word of the word .
and it &apos;s a lot of different forms of life .
i just give you a few examples of the types of types of types of people who are not the male or female standard .
in a case , you may have someone with a computer company , and the gene &apos;s gene &apos;s gene leaves the heat , the most prolific gene that we have , all of the time , to the testes we have .
and that &apos;s why the testicles are giving testosterone to the stage of testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to see testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t react to testosterone .
and that &apos;s called the most powerful .
so much testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as a consequence , the body is going to be the typical female of the typical female .
if the child is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it &apos;s usually to get the puberty and grow their breasts and grow their breasts , but they don &apos;t get their period , until someone comes to it , that there &apos;s something different .
and they make a few tests and find out that instead of the other , they &apos;re actually carrying out , and the uterus , in fact , is carrying up , and they have a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold this person for a male , but that &apos;s not really them .
women , like men , have something called the people that are called the most important .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the most prolific places are , you know , the acoustic hormones .
most women , like i -- i think to be a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real favorite , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me actually talk to the humanities .
we produce the dna systems and we &apos;re talking to the humanities .
the consequence is that someone like me actually has a brain that was exposed to more , more than a woman who was born with testicles , and a computer company has a baby .
so gender is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be distributed across the whole range , you can be distributed .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as a boy , when young was being raised , had a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he had just found that he had a pat and a uterus .
he had an extreme form of an analog family .
he has a lot of the chromosome , and in the womb , his favorite , so much active , they were basically producing a male male .
and as a consequence , his built-in male was going to be exposed to the baby &apos;s brain , the brain &apos;s male male .
and when he was born , he saw a boy from -- no one had a little bit .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he was inside the inside that the doctors were found that he was inside female .
okay , just a quick example of a variation of a robot .
some people with the chromosomes , they develop something called the most powerful , which is called the internet &apos;s disease .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why children with this kind of body -- it &apos;s a little bit of the way that they &apos;re , or a little bit of the twins , is it &apos;s a lot of time -- from surgeons often adapted to the norm , is not because this is for their physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they &apos;re often done different kinds of surgical surgeries is because they threaten our social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that a certain amount of anatomical expression has been associated with a certain identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is called a female identity , a black person , is to be a black person , called , to have an african anatomy in terms of their own story .
so we have this awful simplistic idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body that is actually something very different for us , that &apos;s a very different thing to do in terms of these kinds of things .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about cogs .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of cogs .
now you can imagine how amazing it is , when children are born , the two people are in a body .
where i &apos;ve been seeing most of the excitement , the south african philharmonic was the largest year of south africa , whose gender was asked by the most violent world in berlin .
many journalists called me the question : &quot; what are you going to do , who tells us whether the average is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalist that there &apos;s no test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not a line between us and female , or between male and female and female and female and female and female and female and female and female .
so we have a situation where , the further our science , we have to say that these categories that we have thought of for robust rates , which made very simple amounts of energy to create a lot of the very simple , very simple , more little than we &apos;ve assumed .
and that &apos;s not just gender .
it &apos;s also about race , which turns out to be a lot more complicated than our energy system has been approved .
we &apos;ve been in our observation of all kinds of different areas .
we &apos;re going to go to the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what should we do with the fact that we just differ from a few pounds of them ?
while we continue to move our science forward , we get increasingly into a zone of awkwardness where we need to recognize that the most primitive categories we &apos;ve probably had is too simple .
we see this in all sorts of different areas of human life .
one of the areas that we see in the world &apos;s climate culture , in our culture today , are the struggle of the beginning and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about what the point is to people , so that he &apos;s got a different right than the fetal life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- perhaps not as public as in medicine -- about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors had never been so hard to fight the question when someone was dead .
they &apos;ve only held a feather under the nose , and if they moved , they haven &apos;t buried them yet .
if you didn &apos;t move more , you &apos;d buried it .
but today we are in a situation where we take people vital organs and want to put them together .
and as a result , we were getting to the fight with the really difficult question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation that we don &apos;t have as simple as we have .
now you might think that the whole thing that you would do is make a difference of categories like me .
i &apos;m politically vulnerable , i &apos;m going to be a lot of people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it &apos;s nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , &quot; i think it &apos;s a huge way to do it .
and it makes me tense in terms of the democracy .
so to tell you about this tension , i have to first take a fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were a little bit of the time , i know they were a little bit of the time , but they were great .
i think they were so eager and strong , and so radical , which they did , i &apos;m going to see all of the years that i was going to see the most powerful in the world , and it &apos;s not because of music that &apos;s absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s going on with the most cosmopolitan .
the founding fathers were from my view of the original path , which is why .
what they were doing was a concept of a concept , and they were using it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , our founding fathers , the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the masters of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of the brain .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power should have this political power , because of the death of the grandfather , the father &apos;s father , and so on .
the founding fathers , the founding , and they took them back through a new idea of concept , and this concept said that all people were creating the same thing .
they &apos;re going to be the field of playing and decided that dj was seeing the common ones , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they did this for part because they were part of a system of a system in which two things were in common .
democracy grew up , but the same time grew up the science .
if you look at the history of the founding fathers , it &apos;s clear that many of you were interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a world &apos;s concept .
they went away from explanations , and they were kind of meadows , and they were making things like a supernatural concept of power , where the transmission of the transmission is based on a very highly valid concept of a 42,000 .
they moved to a very basic concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature .
they talk about nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , they managed to give us a concept of a publication of separation .
and so they have really wonderful , really , the future civil rights .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened after years ?
for example , women who are doing the right to the vote of the fathers , the concept of the founding fathers , and said , &quot; that we have a uterus and the treatable , &quot; and said , &quot; we have a uterus and the colon , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . &quot;
and women are successful .
next , the successful civil rights system , where we saw people like the most cosmopolitan , which is about the most important , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the world &apos;s office lines , which say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people different color colors that are related to a lot of similarities in a way of making difference , and they &apos;re successful .
we see the same thing at the same time .
of course , the problem is that , as we start looking at all the common similarities , we have to start asking why we are staying certain of the way we are doing certain points .
now , mind , i want to maintain certain believers , and we see , in our culture , in our culture .
i don &apos;t want to give you a fish for example , like a human being .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that five times the right thing to do is to give your informed consent to sex or to marry .
so there are some of the anatomical dives that make sense for me , and that we think , i think , should keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re feeling .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that have been launched at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in 1979 , at the same day , in 1979 .
so let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , three months of training , is born in 1980 , so she was born at june 1 .
henry , on the other side , is born to the most popular , so he was born at march .
only because of the fact that maria was born three months of the world , they all get different rights to the two months ago -- the right to have sex , which is right to pick the right .
henry has to wait for all of this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of the most of his birth of his birth .
we find other oddities of what their rights are .
henry , because you think he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the mit guy with the sex of the -- because you think he &apos;s a male , he can now move to what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
maria , but it can &apos;t be the same in all states that the adoption in all states have , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
henry can marry a woman , but maria can only marry a woman today in a few states .
so we have this permanent path of the problem that are in many ways , and questionable .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is going to make progress in the field of anatomy that we have to be able to admit that democracy is based on anatomy , which is a democracy that is based on anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time it feels like the science is going to be autonomous .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture is a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; well , we need to pull a line somewhere , so we pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught up in a very strange position .
so for example , texas has decided to get a man to marry that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and a woman means to marry that you have a y chromosome .
now , in practice , people are not tested on their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i told you about the most about the most exciting .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream . &quot;
he says we should not be able to be people &apos; color , but after the property of their character , &quot; judge , &quot; and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you judge people because of their characters ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to know that i know a series of golden design people that probably make the benefits of the benefits that i know .
i want to be able to know that i probably know some bright light systems that are the most powerful , more intelligent and more mature decisions about sexual relations than some of the people i know .
so how do we get the question to the characteristics of the character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really hard .
and part of me wonder what if the content was a personality , which would be in the future of a personality -- could be made by an fmri ?
do we really want to go to this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is leading to the idea of asking questions about democracy .
in our quest to do democracy , we &apos;ve done our thing right , and i think we would do well in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , for example , in iran , where a man who feels sexually to other men , is being punished with death , because he &apos;s ready to put a car &apos;s license in which he can stay alive .
there are no conditions that exist in us .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these conditions -- a surgeon i talked about a few years ago , who had a few of the things that had a few of the people who had a few of them to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i was talking to him , and he asked him why he did this surgeries -- it was high surgeries -- his answer , that in his country , these kids would be very bad , and that &apos;s why he had to do it .
i said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve moved political to think of it , instead of a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states is an incredible opportunity to allow people to be the ones they are , without the state of the state .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to finish , i want to notice that i talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibility of how democracy could look , or looked at the way we could have more involved in the mothers .
and i want to say something that is radical for a feminist , and i think that there might be different kinds of insights that are about different kinds of anatomy that are made by different kinds of anatomy .
since years , because i was interested in the research of the world , i &apos;ve also been interested in research in the field of research .
and one of the things i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from the study of studies is that women , average -- not every , but in average -- more complex , more complex relationships and the care of people who are vulnerable to the group of people who are vulnerable to the group .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i did a graduate student , one of my graduate students who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked as a feminist , so i &apos;m going to do it -- really a very strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism female is . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about the stereotypes of gender , so feminism is nothing female .
but the more i thought about his question to be so much more thought i could give it a little female in feminism .
this is what &apos;s going to be called , there might be something , in average , which is a female brain of male brains , which makes us a little bit more sophisticated for the social social relationships , and to make a sense of the most powerful for the world &apos;s disease .
so where the founding fathers were extremely disruptive , how individuals could be protected from the state of the state , it &apos;s possible that if we &apos;re more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re more likely to be a concept of the way we can do it , but how we can care for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go to the future when we have democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual bodies , which is identity , and think more about relationships .
so , if we try to make a more perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a comic and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;ve got in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with a skeptic .
i love to find a different opportunity to find a different kind of crazy , crazy outfit , and also photograph , and also photograph , and to lead to a blog .
but i don &apos;t buy new .
i get all my clothes out of the second hand on the street and in the street .
ooh , thank you .
and the way i &apos;m allowed to reduce the impact of my favorite system is to reduce the environment and also the mine on my wallet .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars for usually a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it &apos;s going to go shopping to my own personal health system .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i &apos;ll tell you what i &apos;ve been doing for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does someone do with so many of the gharial ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven of my underwear , and that &apos;s all .
and the only week that i &apos;ve done is all of the time i did in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve bet that i would be able to do everything i would like to wear , if i was just coming to palm springs .
and since you &apos;ve heard of me as the woman who &apos;s sitting here at ted in her underwear -- that &apos;s what i found a few things .
and i want to show you my co-author for this week .
does it sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;ll also leave you with some of the lessons i believe whether you believe it or not , from these foreign efforts , nothing new to wear .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the luminous tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the coat , has taken me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i was wearing all week .
monday : color is a little powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiological impossible to be bad , if you wear a pants pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you get other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation is completely avoided .
i spent a lot of time trying to try and try and be able to be myself , and adapt to me at the same time .
be just who you are .
if you surrounded yourself with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it , you &apos;ll appreciate it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people say i saw , i saw , &quot; i &apos;m going to be able to dig them up or i remember her .
i &apos;m smiling , and i &apos;m saying , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re going to see something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think that you &apos;re not good at something , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to wrap this up for you .
if you believe that you &apos;re inside and the outside one , you &apos;re a wonderful person , you don &apos;t have anything you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to rock everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden , to everything .
and finally , saturday : a own , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world about a little bit without having to say a word .
it was always proven to me and again when in this week people were coming to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home , i &apos;ll give you all the time .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to emotionally use these things , because the same thing is going to be a different crazy , more powerful , more powerful , and there &apos;s just a little bit of a crazy thing to do , if i love a little bit in the heart and search .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all together .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as a flying , as flying as flying .
this is what we call our lab , and we call design design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every young in italy grows with this picture in his room , but the reason why i &apos;m showing you this is that this is something that happened in the formula in the last decades .
a few times ago , if you wanted to win a formula , you took her budget , and you put your money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now , you need to take a race , if you want to win a race , actually something like this -- something that &apos;s going to be the car in real time , some thousand sensors that are going to pass information from the car , and then make things happen in real time and make things in real time .
this would be called , in the blink of a game , a computer company .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made out of two parts -- a piece of a piece of a piece and a computer system .
what &apos;s interesting today is the most important thing to do is come into our lives .
our cities were equipped in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to be in the free .
and as a computer in free , they start to react to other kinds of ways , and they &apos;re being seen and driven .
if we &apos;re going to cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population is living there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the world &apos;s population -- cause 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
beyond the cities , all of this sense and driving in objects is going to be a daily life .
this is from an exhibition , paola antonelli for moma later , while the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , start to talk to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom out there to both , one sensor and a sensor .
and that changes radically the interaction that we have people with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , as a michelangelo shaped the moses , it &apos;s called the hammer , and he threw him on moses -- actually , you can still see a little spot -- and said , &quot; well , &quot; the name of the world &apos;s favorite , &quot; why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
now , today , our environment begins to be the first time to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with the sense .
now the first project i want to introduce you to is in fact of one of the first of our lab .
it was born four years ago in italy .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually a new way of using the network that was used in the world -- that &apos;s a very , very anonymous -- and anonymous and a lot of information from this network to use the way that the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was the south asian , the u.s.
some of you will remember it was in italy against france , and then the end of the end , the most powerful .
and no matter , italy won on the end .
now , you see what happened on this day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see the most playful , the flow of the flow .
the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline up .
early afternoon , people here and there , the calls and they move .
the game starts -- silence .
france makes a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
so , in a nutshell , people do a short call , go on toilet .
second , the normal play . end of the normal .
first extension , second .
and the point of life , in a moment of the world &apos;s office .
italy wins . yeah .
now , in this night , all of the center went to celebrate .
they saw the big key .
the next day , all of the time , went to the center of the world and the prime minister to the same time .
and then all of them went down .
you see the picture of the space of the space , which is where the roman time , the people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the key one at the end of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we can feel the city today , a way of not able to do it a few years ago .
even quickly , another example of feeling : here &apos;s not about people , but to do things that we use and consume .
now , we know all about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that are a mac computer , like they came together .
but we just know little about where things go .
so we actually designed some little markers in this project to track the garbage while it goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers that we have , something more than a year ago , in seattle , which is to tag things that they &apos;re going to be able to throw -- different kinds of things , like you can see -- things that you would throw away from .
then we have the little chips that are little brands , the little brands , and they started tracking it .
here are the results that we have right now .
from seattle ...
after a week .
and with this information we realized that there &apos;s a lot of plastic in the system .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of the research of the world , and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day , the cup that we throw away , not just disappears , that they still are somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw away every day is still there .
and if we were to show the people , then we can move a behavior change .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , the most powerful , could tell you a lot more about the sense and the many other wonderful things that you can do with perceive , but i want to talk to the second part of the world that we discussed at the beginning and that &apos;s the most powerful of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in southern spain , spain .
it started with a question of the village , which came to us and said that spain and the most beautiful tradition have a beautiful tradition to use water as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology , new technology with this ?
and one of the ideas that were measured in a computer factory was , imagine that these tubes , and valves , the valves , work , they work and close .
they &apos;re going to cause a kind of a water company with a water company .
if these are the most important ones fall down , they can write patterns , they can write patterns , images , text .
and you can go to him , and he will open up to make it open , like you can see on this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor to the mayor .
it &apos;s really like him .
and we got the mission to design the phone in the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was made of water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you &apos;re approaching it , it will open up and you &apos;ll leave it in .
the roof was covered with water also .
and if it &apos;s windy , if you want to reduce the syringes , you can even let the roof down .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture will be like in this case , you know , this days , if you &apos;re going to get the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t destroy the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
here you see the building works .
you see the person who &apos;s going to ask what happens inside .
and here you see me when i tried to test the sensors that opened the water , not to become wet .
now , i should tell you what happened at night when all the sensors stopped .
but actually , it was a greater fun .
all the children from the street came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to make them , but a building that still had breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump off without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we think about how people use things that we design .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beautiful thing to create things that are used and interact with people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical design of water , the most abstract of water and the projections .
and this is what brought us to think about this project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine that these are really starting to fly in front of these things .
imagine , you could have little helicopter that fly through the air , and every one of them with a little bit of light with a little bit of light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter that you saw before , which is moving with other people , completely in sync .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or irregular but irregular , in three dimensions that changes what changes , the light is not the position of the world &apos;s position .
you can play with different kinds of ways .
imagine the screen just in different ways , or sizes , in different ways .
but then the whole thing could be a 3d cloud from the street that you can go to and move through the way you can go through many , many directions .
here you see a real , real estate , which is a very , very clear v to form a second of the time .
if you turn the light , it looks like this . so , as we saw before .
imagine that every single one of people is being run .
it could have any single impulse to have a impulse that comes from people , from the movements of people or whatever .
i want to show you something here first .
we worked with a computer company , one of the best ballet dancers of our time -- the most salient on the metropolitan theater in new york and the power of milan -- we took his movements into 3d to use it as a impulse for the design system .
here you see the dancing dance .
on the left , you see the most different , the different sensations , the different sensations .
it &apos;s a very crude and a more powerful one .
so they can feel the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we all have the most sophisticated , you can play with it and play with color and play .
we want to use this as a possible impulse for the most important .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we work on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is , again , imagine that we &apos;re going to put the people together to do something and change the environment -- almost like we call it , to incorporate it into a cloud , but with a cloud .
imagine that every one of the little donation can give you a little donation .
i think that the remarkable thing about the last few years is that we &apos;re changing from a physical world to a digital world .
it has digitized everything , knowledge , and it &apos;s accessible to the internet .
today , we can do the first time -- and the campaign has shown this -- we can move from the digital world , from the self-organizing forces of the networks to the physical world .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
that &apos;s what &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can be to ask us to ask the challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world to physical change ?
so the idea is that we actually put people together in which they do things together , collective .
the cloud is again a cloud of plastic , in the same way , like a real cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud of plastic .
it &apos;s a physical physical form in london , but with a lot of water .
you can move and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments for the foreign 2012 and the other parts , and it &apos;s as a kind of connection to community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go to the top , like london &apos;s new top of the mountain .
you can go .
and a kind of digital v in the night -- but as a computer designer , a new way of experience for all of the people who want to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important to the context .
i &apos;m trying to express that people are not separated from nature , and that everything is connected to each other .
the first time i was in antarctica almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first revelations .
i was doing awe .
my heart sank , i was a little bit of a time , while i was trying to grab what was going on .
the icebergs around me almost 60 feet from the water , and i could only wonder that this was a snowflake on a different snowflake , year year .
and the icebergs are born as a calf , or by a glacier , by breaking out of a glacier .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they interact with their environment and their experiences .
some people are giving up and to be careful to the bitter end , while others don &apos;t have any more and more dramatic passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you think they &apos;re isolated , separated and alone , as we often see people .
but the truth is far away from it .
while a iceberg melts , i put his carbon on the atmosphere .
while the iceberg is melting , he &apos;s blowing water , which feeds many forms of life .
i &apos;m going to go to my footage of these icebergs as if i was going to make portraits of my ancestors , in consciousness that they exist in these individual moments , and never exist again .
it &apos;s not a death , if you melt ; it &apos;s not a end , but a very , very high of your life cycle along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the ice industry i &apos;m going to be a very young -- some thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is a iceberg that i &apos;ve got in the greenland in greenland .
very rarely , you actually witness a single iceberg .
here you see it .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg , and where it &apos;s on the top of the iceberg .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a computer .
it reaches about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is real .
and just like that , you show the iceberg a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really blessed by working with some amazing projects .
but at the coolest , what i &apos;ve ever worked on , it was about this guy .
his name is a little bit of a sudden .
and the one of the leading graffiti was one of the leading graffiti of the 1980s .
then , one day he came back from walking and said , &quot; dad , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the outbreak .
now , the most paralyzed is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood up to him .
i have a company that makes design and animations , so it &apos;s inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the art world and look at .
so we decided , tony -- and he &apos;s to support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
i just want to talk to him , and i said , &quot; wait , is that not -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all be the paralyzed people using this devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you heard about higher and a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not available to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , how do you communicate ? &quot;
does anybody see the movie &apos; butterfly and the &quot; butterfly &quot; ?
so they communicate -- they &apos;re running along their fingers .
i was amazed , &quot; very , very much , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came to the need , just just a check , and instead , i put a check out of that , which i didn &apos;t have the smallest idea of how i was supposed to cash him .
i kept ashamed of the place and the father , and his father -- &quot; well , my proposal is , &quot; well , my proposal is , tony &apos;s going to be able to get it , we &apos;ll get him a device and we &apos;ll find a way to make it back .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s all wearing this in it , cannot communicate . &quot;
so i spoke to a conference later at a conference .
i met these people from the university of the , graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on every surface and then draw with a light of the light that only recognizes the negative surface .
so they &apos;re moving around and they make a lot of things like this .
they say that all things are going to be shown up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the suburbs , then the most important , then the most important , and finally , the people are doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in her presentation .
so i went home , and i ate my wife and i was telling her , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology , you can use it to control your eyes , to control things , and then we should find a way that it could be a laser , that it would be a laser , that it would be a laser . &quot;
this was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve reached some things .
first , we have the insurance insurance industry , and actually have a device for the world , and actually , you can get a device that he can communicate with -- a stephen scholar .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him a little bit of the time , because you talk to him , or get an email , and thinks , &quot; i &apos;m so busy , this guy &apos;s incredible . &quot;
and also , we have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and the programmers and the engineers have taken our house .
many of our friends thought we were beautiful , that we were beautiful to do and that we were all the images on the walls .
but for about two weeks , we have programmed , we went to the street center in venice , my children were involved , and we were also creating this .
it &apos;s called the most powerful and you can see the description .
this is a cheap nell that we bought on the most of venice , something that &apos;s a little bit more powerful and a few things from the local hardware and the water system .
we took a laser , they have a little bit of a light set , they put them on a light and now we have a device that &apos;s free -- you can build it yourself , we can put the code free to download the software .
so we created a device that is completely free from constraints .
no insurance can be able to get it .
no hospital .
everybody paralyzed in fact , actually , can communicate with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s a room of somebody else and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all of these online forums before the great unveiling .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of planning , and the next nights , tony , and the first time , tony drew up to seven years after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and it looks beyond his life support .
we have stuck his bed so that he can see out .
we put a projector on a wall of the hospital , the hospital .
and he was doing the first time , in the middle of his family , and friends -- and you can just imagine what was a sense of a lot of the time .
so , we had to break in the parking lot , so we felt like a part of the world &apos;s brain .
at the end , he was sending us an email with the content , &quot; for the first time for seven years , i &apos;ve been drawn something .
i feel that i was pushed down underwater , and finally , someone went down and raised my head , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
this is something like our favorite system .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re holding on the shelf and we keep going to keep it on .
and we have to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a very amazing device .
and somebody who has such an artistic potential is so much more .
so we &apos;re in finding out how to do better and stronger .
since this time , we &apos;ve all been getting all sorts of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one made us .
it &apos;s all from our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong , over us , and then , in december , has been honored to be honored to be a half of the invention of 2010 , which was really great .
and the most important thing about this is -- and that &apos;s what it does all the circle -- that this april , in the middle of the city , will give a show of los angeles in the inner city of los angeles .
and there &apos;s probably a very toughest representative of the world &apos;s rights , and there &apos;s a lot of the toughest representative of the world &apos;s rights -- the most common , the ones that are going to be there .
and the point is that the show is going to be part of what &apos;s pretty wild .
so basically , i &apos;m about to say , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , it &apos;s possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the microphone -- everything was impossible .
do it possible -- you all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never had anything to do with a little bit of time , but i just put something out and i &apos;ve been surrounded with amazing people so that we could put something on the legs .
and this question should be , everybody , and that &apos;s a single day , which is something that you have to do , which is that you have to do something that has to be done , if not now , when , if you don &apos;t , who then ?
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably in america &apos;s most often most frequently known .
and i always say that i don &apos;t want to get a scientist like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever elected farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
well , a epiphany is usually something that you find because you &apos;ve left it somewhere .
you &apos;re going to go to the block and it &apos;s a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard mcwhorter .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you today .
my circle began in the &apos; 60s at high school in the &apos; 60s , ohio , where i was the most popular .
i was the one who was beaten in the green green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using the toilet in the prison room .
that did it .
she did three years .
and i had to go out of the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it was struck me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then i found it in the &apos; 80s , and i found it in the &apos; 80s .
about three or four years ago , i got a call in the middle of the night , a call of this teacher , woman , who said , &quot; i have to see it .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other as adults .
you can come to ohio , and please come together with the man i know that you &apos;ve found it .
and i should mention that i have a little bit of time , and i want you to go to it . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we saw them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them up , and we went to them , and we gave them eight , because it needed to be necessary .
it was something that we knew .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults , i turned to know , it turned out to be a box full of ashes and put into my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation of that i showed you .
the revelation is , death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything the rest of life needs .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is so often mentioned here .
he needs the same -- he would need , love and pleasure . and it &apos;s to give us these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , as you go up on 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a motor engine , which is binary , cognitive , cognitive , cognitive , cognitive , cognitive power , laws .
that sounds scary .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat on a street .
i was the only one who could talk to the most amazing .
so i saw them right , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve probably caught some birds . &quot;
the pilot had turned the machine and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot set up the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s not the route .
it turns out the engines .
imagine a little bit of a plane plane .
and then he said three words -- the most popular words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; the head of the hit . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the most of the time .
i could see it in your eyes , because it was horror , life was too close .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
we have this kind of dna , we have these things that we want to do in life and i thought to all the people i wanted to make a hand and not did , all the fences that i wanted to make , all the fences i wanted to do and never did .
while i was thinking about it , a saying that was , &quot; i collect bad wines . &quot;
because if the wine is as far and the person is there , i open it up .
i never want to move anything in life .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we were to put george washington bridge , so pretty much about eight -- i thought , man , there &apos;s a thing i really really really do .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , with my mistakes , i was getting better to become better in everything i &apos;m doing .
but i &apos;ve also given my ego to my own ego .
and i was the time that i was wasting the time for the most important things that i &apos;m wasting for people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to people , to people .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t plan to talk about my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have a right , right , i &apos;m going to be happy to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and that &apos;s when the inner clock is , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , &quot; ...
you see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please flying into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts , like you know it from a documentary .
while we had a separate , i felt that i was going to die , man , to die .
almost as if we prepare our lives for us .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and the sadness really , really , really , in a thought , is that i just wanted to wish one thing .
i wish i could see my kids growing up .
about a month after that , i went to a performance of my daughter -- first , not a lot of artistic talent ...
... not yet .
and i &apos;m going to call , i &apos;m crying like a little kid .
and in the world , everything was made for me .
i realized that i was clearly in the same way by connecting the dots to the other , that it &apos;s just about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else is my only goal to be a good father .
i was not going to die in the wonder of that day .
i got another gift , which is to see the future , and to live and live differently .
my call to all of that flies today is : imagine , the same thing happens on your flight -- don &apos;t you -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
what would you do , that you &apos;re going to delay , because you think you &apos;re always there ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parents you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the cloning is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for the development of nuclear weapons is the most important thing in the world .
the gray boxes that you see here are the most powerful .
now , if we &apos;re going to do that , the systems that control the systems and the valves , we can actually do a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with the surface of the world ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we do it , a effective climate system is used on a laptop that &apos;s used by a computer of a football box to get these gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning of the building .
so we start with a computer company .
the most popular thing is going to go through the gray box , defeat the centrifuge and the iranian , and the iranian state of farming , in the way , was done .
that &apos;s a little bit of a match , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started to digitize our research six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was the sense and purpose of this kind of thing .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated what the most important part of the world &apos;s brain is , the most powerful part , he made a lot of these kinds of plastic use .
and it seemed something called a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of these gray boxes , these gray boxes .
and this is what we &apos;ve been doing , and we started a project project , which we were infected with our environment with acquired our environment , and we studied this building .
and then something weird happened .
so , in the way , it &apos;s been called a kind of a business company that &apos;s not like our cheese -- it &apos;s not going to be a -- but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that was not a sense of my eyes .
and after we had been experimenting with different kinds of cheese , i went to that this is a more dramatic attack .
completely on a particular goal .
the most popular run on the gray box , when a special configuration was discovered , even if the special program , which is trying to infect it , is going to be going on on this goal .
and if not , then , in fact , osha does nothing .
so , that really did my interest and we started working on the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , we &apos;re an american power station , or a u.s. power in germany .
so we should soon find out what the goal is .
so , we have the most powerful code and we found that it &apos;s in two digital warheads , and it &apos;s a smaller and a larger one .
and we also realized that they were very professional , from people who were obviously all the most sophisticated information to the information .
they knew any bits and the more sophisticated ones that they had to attack .
probably they knew the most important of the internet &apos;s office .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve heard that the most powerful of cloning complex and high-tech is , let me tell you , the most important thing is , the science is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more sophisticated than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this kind of code code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
looks like old-fashioned design .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code .
so after what we were looking for first , the most important thing was , we know what these are doing .
and then we looked for the street and we tried to get these with the real world in connection -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could record or prove .
so to make these theories , we call ourselves a reminder that it &apos;s definitely about the most powerful , it has to be a quality of a high goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran because most of the infections were reported .
now , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
it &apos;s basically running out of the nuclear power of nuclear power and on the ground in the field of water .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all the experts for madison and power plants from our client . &quot;
and i called them and i &apos;d tell her to compare her to the expertise to compare her expertise to what we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring us the little digital to the computer of the brain .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipulated the speed of this kind of thing , you actually can actually crack the rotor and then actually get the centrifuge to explode .
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was actually to make it slow and really , really , to try and make it happen -- to make a look at the trial that they would not be able to get on the way to get behind .
the big digital technology system -- we got a glimpse of that we looked at very precisely data and we looked at it .
so for example , the number of things that are going on is very out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started to do scientific literature , which is how this centrifuge is built in the coastal field , and found that they &apos;re a structured in so-called the so-called , and every single unit of estrogen contains a little bit of the time .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it was better .
this centrifuge in iran are divided in 15 called the levels .
and guess what we found in the world &apos;s office ?
one almost identical structure .
so again , that fit really well .
and this gave us great confidence for that , which we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just that way .
these results were achieved by several weeks of work .
and often we were running in a dead and we had to collect ourselves .
anyway , we found that both digital warheads in reality are actually on one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little little bit of the light takes a video , and the blood scans , and it &apos;s slowed down the rotors and the big , big estate , and the big one is going to be with six of the things that are in interaction and manipulated .
so , in the big and all of us , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have what the goal is .
it &apos;s a little bit of a plastic and it &apos;s just a little bit of a mess .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be met by stuxnet .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- i really made me out of the socks .
there &apos;s the gray box down there , and the top is the centrifuge .
now , what this thing is doing is that it &apos;s the circuitry of sensors of sensors -- for example , from the design and the most important code -- and it &apos;s available to the code that &apos;s still available during the attack , with false forces , running .
and in fact , this false data data is taken by stuxnet before .
so it &apos;s just like in the car car , where the car car is fed with the sex of the car .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the idea of this is obviously not just the most important thing in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to cheat a digital network .
we need digital design systems where a human being can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a power station , for example , if the big oil industry becomes too fast , you have to open up in milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human being .
so , in this place , we need digital design systems .
and if the risk of risk is , you can really do bad things .
the power power can explode .
and neither the most popular , the most important thing is going to notice .
that &apos;s scary .
but it &apos;s going to be worse .
and what i &apos;m saying is very important .
think about it . this attack is a little bit of a time .
he &apos;s not doing anything specifically with centrifuge , with a little bit of time .
so he would work for example , for example , in a power station or in a plant station .
it &apos;s a little bit of a plastic .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to put the internet &apos;s stick on a stick , like we saw it in cloning .
you could also use ordinary technology technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you eventually get a mass weapon of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the consequence we need to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most profound environments .
we need to ask the consequences and we &apos;re going to start getting better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was reported very much that people think that the most important thing is the most powerful one is the most popular thing behind .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
i think the most important thing is , the driving force is not israel , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the most important superpower .
there &apos;s only one and that &apos;s the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for having a quantitative maker . thank you ralph .
i spent the last few years to place myself in situations that normally are very difficult and somehow dangerous .
i went to jail -- difficult .
i worked in a computer factory -- dangerous .
i filmed in a shot -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days to eat nothing as this -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
i actually have the biggest part of my career , and i &apos;ve been exposed to terrible situations , and that &apos;s all for trying to study social , and i &apos;m going to be able to do that , and hopefully , and hopefully , in a way , what they &apos;re making for the audience more fun and accessible .
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world of the world &apos;s world , and i knew i was going to do something a little bit different .
some of you may have heard that i took a display on ebay a few weeks ago .
i sent a few of the pieces of wood , some of the most powerful , and i gave people the opportunity to go to the ted community in 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , and the people , they got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson never will let me go back -- the most important thing to buy , the most important thing that was going to be , and not a lot of evidence that was actually going to be a title of the talk .
so what you got was this : your name here : my tedtalk , from which you don &apos;t know what the subject will be , and the one that you could ever fly to the ears , especially if i could look at your company for your involvement .
but it &apos;s a very good media opportunity , but it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
this is just the most important thing .
so despite this warning , i knew that anybody would buy the most poor .
if you asked me this one year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you this with certainty .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
i said , i &apos;ve been going to go in some pretty terrible situations , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could be made , and so dangerous , and so dangerous as with these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is a film about the design of marketing , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by the whole film , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the
so what happens in &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; down , &quot; is that everything from the top to the end , is completely connected to the end of the day , which is the brand that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand .
now this brand , the most powerful stadium , the most popular center ...
these people are being connected to the film in eternity forever .
and so the film is going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , for forever ?
i &apos;m a person &apos;s person .
that was more to the present .
it was &quot; in eternity forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x as a computer designer , but we &apos;re going to be sure that we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the movie .
so we might sell a shoe and it will be the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever carried ...
the greatest car you ever have , from &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the most famous drink of the world &apos;s greatest drink , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , a attention of &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are part of life , actually , to bring them to the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of all the film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of the publication .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy if i would help to do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how to be people &apos;s sake .
have you a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective &quot; because that has a negative , but you know how to develop it ?
how much money will it require to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s worth it , some really well-known brands .
who knows if the movie comes out , we might see a tribe of a whole bunch of things .
what do you think the answer is ?
the answer is probably , &quot; no , &quot; no .
but is it a difficult thing for the movie or a difficult thing to do because of me ?
jk : both .
so , don &apos;t mean that optimistic .
so , my lord , you can help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands .
yes .
if you look at people who you have to do ...
there are some places that we can turn to .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera &quot; would mean that we wanted to lead a more of the time .
it turns out it was actually meant , &quot; we want to do nothing with your film . &quot;
and just that , all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
no one wanted to do something with the film .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept of advertising was so many people as possible to present your product as many people as possible , so many people like possible .
especially in the world today , on this interface of new and old media and the fragmented media media -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting , exciting , that the masses will bring this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a kind of a mistake , and that was the following .
actually , no , that wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
that would have been no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is is a problem .
see , if you &apos;re transparency in the field of the field , this is one of the first images that seems to be .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and the way to discover , and to discover , and then , in fact , characterized by the visibility and access to information , especially what &apos;s the most important line is the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re listening to a whole lot of transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says it even tells our ceos .
but if it comes to that , it &apos;s supposed to be done , it &apos;s going to change something .
but why ? well , transparency is scary -- like this strange bear , which still predicts .
it &apos;s a little bit of a -- like this strange highway .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is more risky ?
a whole dish cool food .
that &apos;s very risky .
so when i started talking to companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid , and my father caught me in the lie -- and he &apos;s sitting and he looks at me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions of the story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there &apos;s only one company , an agency ready to help us -- and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve been john bond and richard bond for years -- i found that i had to do it alone , and i had to go directly to the companies .
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking with these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , a broad problem is .
i have friends who make big , giant , giant , and i have friends that are doing little bits of wood .
and my friends , the great , giant , giant , say that the reason why their movies are so successful , is the most successful thing they have .
and then my friends , who do little bits of wood , &quot; well , how do we compete with these big , gigantic , giant , giant , giant ones ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the
so how exactly are we going to see in the movie ?
whenever i do the way i do , and whenever i open the most open , you &apos;ll see the power of the air .
and every time i get somebody to get a person , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
they &apos;re so far ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you calm .
so maybe you should be a little bit of this interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great things .
either &quot; nuclear fusion &quot; or &quot; paradise &quot; , they &apos;re going to have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped for men as well as women -- solid , or a stick , whatever .
this is the most powerful .
now i can answer all of your questions and give you a more powerful version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand a brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so , doing things like this -- you know , people remember yield -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in it .
what words would you describe ?
yield is a lot of fuel .
this is a great question .
girl &apos;s technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone is doing under the cheating .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that these category really make a positive thing , unlike &quot; fighting odor and moisture . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep it fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three fresh , three .
these things have a more positive effect .
and this is a very reactive .
what about me ? what about the most important ?
i have to talk to the man on the street that are like me , the way i &apos;m , i &apos;m going to be a guy .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like to really love nice clothes .
&apos; 80s , in the street , is true of the street , except at the heart of the day .
well , what &apos;s the brand of the brand ?
unique .
i think the most important thing that i have , the style that i have , is &quot; the glamour glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , many of the things that are like this .
but normally i have a design of the way , like the meditators , or a jewelry and so stuff .
if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes .
the brand i &apos;m , i &apos;m going to say , is , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; fly fly . &quot;
and part of a woman , part of the , part of the part , part of the day -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the most pessimistic .
i sell a lot of the country in the world , the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was a little bit of a rock .
man 5 : brand plastic &apos;s brand &apos;s license .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a more skeptical .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the most sophisticated , but i often see myself on the interface of the quantum glamour and the fly fly .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed a experts .
i needed somebody who could go into my head , someone who could really help me understand what you call the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; .
and so i found a company called olson , in the lab .
they have companies like the design of business , and they helped to discover these kinds of things .
if you could do it for the do , you could also help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me just a little bit about how to deal with your thoughts and feelings about yourself .
these are the people who form my worldview .
tell me about this world .
so , the world , this world ? i think the world is the world where you live -- how people around you , the friends , the family , the family , the way you live , the work and so .
all these things come and start from a place , and i start to start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s next to you is that you want to talk about .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what is the relationship to the mind and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like strange things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; -- what does it bring us ?
what is the most important thing ? what kind of brain are you going to do ?
why is it important , and what is the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little more about them , that they &apos;re not .
what else do you have through ?
... that doesn &apos;t have to be afraid . what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
get it ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be done .
there was a lot of crazy things that went out there .
the first thing i saw was that this idea that their favorite two separate , but they have a little bit of the pages -- the morgan &apos;s side is a very , very reactive / a brand .
so , the add to it .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies are going to focus on a strength , rather than both .
many companies tend to be -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re going to be afraid , they &apos;re afraid , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to actually make them feel positive , and they &apos;re actually moving to themselves in a positive , and that &apos;s a kind of a moving move .
what other brands are doing ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , target , wii , mini , mini , and the metal of mini .
now , there are a lot of brands and the brands , these things that come and go , but a more powerful , a brand , a brand , a very strong thing .
a computer company , a brand , brand brand . how is your brand ?
if somebody asked them to describe their own , their favorite , their favorite , how would they be ?
you &apos;re a little bit of a computer ? are you something that &apos;s going to bring blood into a car ?
or are they more likely to be a more honest ?
are you something that a little calm down , more conservative , conservative ?
and the things that are the arguments are things that are the playful , fresh , like the most cosmopolitan , adventurous , adventurous , failing and agile , and agile , and agile , pragmatic , magical , magical , magic , magic , magic and magic .
or are they more like a football system ?
are they mindful and more nuanced like the world &apos;s ?
are they established , traditionally , more traditional , compassionate , compassionate , the way oprah ?
are you reliable , stable , safe , safe , safe , safe , sacred , and the way the dalai lama or the dalai lama ?
in the course of the movie , we had more than 500 companies that were up and the top , and the &quot; no &quot; said , &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to have anything to do with this film because they didn &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but it &apos;s going to be 17 , which were ready to get ready to get to this control that would be doing with someone who would do business and make some mistakes like me , and then we &apos;re going to tell stories that we don &apos;t usually have to support -- stories that would never support a computer company .
they &apos;re going to tell us the story of the design of the world , as we tell the story in this movie that you &apos;re using the story of the brain today to make the brain &apos;s work , both to make advertising as well as movies .
we went to sao paulo where we were banned .
in the entire city , for five years , there &apos;s no poster , no poster , no explosives , nothing .
and we went in school school where companies are going to make their way into break schools , in all america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback or where i had the biggest success , those are where i interact with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because she thought the middle of the middle , she thought the agencies , and said that the agencies may not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people think of , that our view is going to challenge .
and how did it be for you ? what it was successful ?
now , since the movie was the movie film festival , we can see that again .
according to the first time , the first time in january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million of these film .
this is actually a period of two weeks of two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film was not going to be left .
there &apos;s no even online . no one &apos;s a television problem .
it &apos;s not coming out in other countries .
well , finally , the film has a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every ad that we talked about , their customers , who are the fingers of it .
something i think is that if you &apos;re going to arrest your chance , risks , you can make risks in these risks .
i think if you prevent people , you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you &apos;re trained to avoid your employees , you &apos;re going to get the whole company ready to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunity that they might be more likely to be .
finally , in progress , we should welcome the fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
they welcome the fear . they welcome the risk .
one big taste of a lot of taste , so we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , we get a little bit more honesty .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk &quot; hot &quot; became transparency , &quot; you know , &quot; i &apos;m going to be welcome to my good friends of the book of the ebay , who paid $ a child &apos;s disease .
big data is turned into the world in large opportunities in big opportunities .
and the name is , &quot; you welcome transparency . &quot;
thank you .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , what is happening with the $ cancer ?
this is a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , in my pocket , on the top of the computer , the most cosmopolitan -- a check in altitude , to fund my favorite year in the next year .
my name is a little bit of a sudden .
18 months ago , i did something else at google , and i &apos;m going to do something with museums and art . my favorite , the most important , i had the green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of the research projects and stories that i can tell you about 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the show .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and your access to it .
i grew up in india .
i was a great education in the -- i &apos;m not going to be -- but i had a lot of museums and this artwork , and i didn &apos;t have access to this art .
when i went to visit , and i started to visit these museums , i started learning a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried to do this longing -- art to make a lot of technology together with technology .
we then set up a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you &apos;re just going to be too .
you can look around in all these museums .
there &apos;s the most popular , the moma , the most sacred , the van gogh , the van gogh .
i even come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get on two because of it -- very simple .
and the math , and the most important thing is , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you &apos;re walking around and you &apos;re delighted .
you want to orient in the museum ?
open the map , and jump it with a click .
they &apos;re in the end of the gangs , they want to end up .
just further . a lot of fun .
explore .
thank you , but the best thing is .
so i &apos;m a student , i &apos;m a ph.d. of the wooden , and i &apos;m a met by pieter &apos;s met .
i see this wishbone .
if the museum gave us the picture , you click on it .
now this is one of the images .
this is all the demographics .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click away now .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve been holding with the so-called so-called the so-called the so-called .
this picture for example , about 10 billion , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you this .
you can easily get in and you can get it in .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is treatable .
but then you really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there &apos;s something going on .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close to the , and i realized slowly that these kids actually beat something .
i was doing a little bit of a little bit of a met with a met , and i actually found out that it &apos;s a game called the &quot; a duck , &quot; which is a goose on the wheel of a stick .
apparently it was popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really go close to the line , you can go to the seams .
just to give you the picture of the picture , i &apos;m out of that , so you see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing is , in a second .
let &apos;s jump fast to moma , again in new york .
another one of me , i &apos;m talking about , is a more unfair .
and at the previous example , it was about finding details .
but what if you want to see the brush ?
and what if you want to see van gogh that masterpiece this masterpiece is because of the way ?
you &apos;re going to go in . you can really go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my favorite books , until i really am at the very very first time .
this is a little bit of a time , probably never before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called the collections .
everybody from them , every -- the same thing , whether they have a great house or poor , doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and create your own museum online -- from all these images , you can put your own collection .
just , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of the power of the brain -- you can get a little bit of time .
this is the most popular , in the world &apos;s office .
you can put everything with crap , send your friends , and so you start to start with what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think finally , for me , the main thing is that all the wonderful things are not coming from google .
they &apos;re not even coming from the museums .
i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was a experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to be just going to be with this digital medium of art , and they &apos;re very cool online .
and the biggest question that i &apos;ve been asked to do is , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a football system ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
that &apos;s what it is . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can split in two camps .
this is the left half that is the logical side and then the right half the right is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the most of the hemisphere , we could be able to measure your brain .
for example , this one would be that someone who &apos;s completely logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you do your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have decided to be one of these extremes , but i think that most people in the audience , their brain , about this -- is about a high , high , high , the same in both of the quarters .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or something like that .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i see myself as one of the people , with most of the experimental experimental technologies that need a good amount of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good percentage of intuition to actually do experiments .
how do we develop these intuition ? well , we love playing things .
so we go out and play with it and then look like it &apos;s responding , and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that a thing can be only at a place .
i mean , it can sound strange about thinking that a thing is at the same time , but it &apos;s not born with this idea , but they were not born with this idea .
i remember seeing a child playing on a computer service .
he was a toddler and not very good at it and he fell constantly .
but i bet that it taught you that playing with the most valuable lesson , which is the big things that you don &apos;t just leave , and that you &apos;re staying in a place .
and this is a great model of the world , so long they &apos;re not a major model of the world .
it would be a terrible model for a computer company because they don &apos;t play with the computer games , but with these little odd particles .
and if you play with your particles , you &apos;re all stuck in the kind of weird things -- like you &apos;re flying directly through walls , or that you can be at the same time at two different places .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the physics of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need to describe them about the great everyday objects around us .
this didn &apos;t enjoy my intuition , and maybe because i don &apos;t often play with particles .
well , i &apos;m sometimes playing with you , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical side is not like it .
because if all of these particles are made of particles and all these particles that follow the rules of quantum mechanics , then wouldn &apos;t it just follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that should not be that way .
so i would better feel better with the whole thing if we could show that everyday objects also follow the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a couple of years ago , right ?
i created one .
this is the first object you can see , which was in the most violent of the brain .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot in the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
so here i &apos;m going to zoom down . we look at this in the center .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal it &apos;s shaped like a ski machine , and it &apos;s about the edge .
so i made this thing on similar ways to make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new york , and i went to a hundred hours of all the big devices .
for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to put this kind of swimming pool , and get this thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the world &apos;s ability to be in the field of the brain , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people go to the other , and i hear all these things because i don &apos;t want to bother them , or , frankly , they &apos;re going to be a little bit of the way they &apos;re going to be .
so quantum mechanics says that the objects are just feeling like this .
the fellow fellow for the world &apos;s favorite objects are not only people , but the light that seems to you and the wind that appears to be on them and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is going to be made , we had to get out of the whole of the whole metal systems .
and we did that .
we &apos;ve turned the light off , put it in a vacuum and the whole air , and it &apos;s all the air , and it &apos;s almost to be in the elevator , and it was the piece of metal , and it was the piece of metal that wanted to be .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it really moves .
instead of just quiet there , it &apos;s just a little bit of the way it was , the way it was like this -- like this -- like a little bit of a sudden , and together , the way that they were doing it , and they &apos;re going to be a little bit of a mess .
we gave him a little push to the same time , we could actually vibrate it at the same time , and not to vibrate -- something just in the quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what really fantastic .
what does it mean to vibrate for an object at the same time and not vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion atoms from the piece of metal is still there , and the same atoms move the same atoms and down .
just too precise , they &apos;re fooled .
the rest of the time are they .
that means that every atom is at the same time at two different places , which is the whole piece of metal on two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
this was worth me for all these year in the clean space , because , check that out , the most powerful between one atom and this piece of metal is about just as much as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at the same time at two different places , this piece can be metal on two different places , why not then it ?
i mean , this is just what my logical side is .
so , imagine you &apos;d be at the same time at the same time , like that ?
how would your consciousness deal with that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
when we put it out , the light is going to be the light and the box , we saw that the piece of metal always was in a piece of metal .
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator in reality are actually just a single thing that is in a small room together .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s more deeper .
it &apos;s that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are . and that &apos;s the deep and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we should be able to think about economic development as we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families think about where they want to live and work , they have given them the opportunity between at least one hand full of different cities that all of them are in competition to be new residents .
now we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries that don &apos;t even have a single city that they &apos;re welcome to .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more value than it costs to build .
so we could just be very simple with the world , maybe hundreds of new cities , perhaps .
now , this may sound absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
but they just share the building of homes against the cities .
imagine half the people who want to live in homes , they did this ; the other half didn &apos;t .
they could try to expand the capacity of the existing apartments .
but you know what you would be doing , in these apartments , and your environment will be able to avoid the laws of the laws and the way you get out of the road .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to keep all of these big points .
but you could go to a completely new place , build a completely new block of construction , and it would be a set of the laws that would be able to support it and not give it to it .
so i proposed that governments create new areas that are going to offer enough space for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
later , i found that , about the same time , the same time , the same time , and the challenge of reform in captivity .
they knew that every year about 75,000 miles of land , their country would leave their country to go into the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same in captivity .
in this place , the way that we have a lot of time is to say , &quot; what happens when we &apos;re going to put a message of the country in the country , what if we just put it on a message of the american embassy , and if people want to work , they can work in the middle of the world , and they can do everything that they &apos;re usually going to do for canada or america . &quot;
in the summer 2009 , loneliness suffered under a severe industrial market .
the next two of the elections , the next election , won the theremin in a shift , whose program both promised innovations , and also promised the program .
he asked the street to become a little bit of his favorite .
in the meantime , i was preparing to tedglobal .
by improving , and through the study of consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter city on the essence of the city .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t be able to make existing access to the existing .
we pay new technologies , but for progress , it takes technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that are going to help us .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk .
again , it showed him a little bit .
the two call me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december of a hotels in miami in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , as much more valuable as they are .
and i used this chart to show how valuable the value of a place is like new york , think about it , a surface of a surface of a square meter .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , in a place when there was a pause , and he said , &quot; paul , we might be able to look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk was in very simple form that a charter city is a place that is a place that is beginning to be the beginning of the country , a more powerful , which defines the laws that are going to be there and not to live in the way that people are going to live , or not .
so i was asked by the president of self-expression , who meant that we need to make this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way we get our country to get it .
i was asked to get to the fourth and then the fourth and fifth january , a talk .
so i &apos;ve given another thing to do with facts , which is a graph like this , which is trying to make that , if you want to make a lot of value in a city , it must be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch is the new airport that was built in denver .
by the time , this airport has a 100 percent area of 100 .
so i tried to convince the most powerful of this if you want to build a new city , you have to start with a field of at least 1,000 .
these are more than 250 thousand acres .
polite , all the main people have .
the faces of the audience were very serious and careful .
the director of congress came to the stage and said , &quot; professor , thank you very much for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i came to the punch line that a new city offers the people new possibilities .
there were the opportunity to live in a city that would be in captivity , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also includes new ways of leaders with one .
the leaders of government in captivity would be based on the help of the aid , they could benefit from their own , which they would be able to do with the laws of the charter and the way they &apos;re doing that , that everybody can actually trust that the charter is really taken .
and the realization of president lobo , that the confidence of the massive people i &apos;ve thought about as a way to get the foreign investors to get the foreign investors could be in the world for all the parties , and to be suffering for all the parties in the world for many years .
we &apos;re in a field .
this is a picture of this place .
it &apos;s just a thousand square miles .
and shortly after that , at the 19th january , they voted in congress for a change to have a change to have a sustainable control that &apos;s made for special food systems .
in a country that has just a massive crisis behind the congress , in congress , to a voice , to a voice .
all parties , all the most common of society , supported this .
and to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved by congress .
february february , it was approved to be approved to a voice .
immediately after this election , between the 21st and 24 february , a delegation of about 30 , a delegation of about 30 places in the world , which were most interested in the business of the world &apos;s business .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a large , new city , which built in south korea , and that &apos;s a big , big city in south korea .
all you can see on this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the introduction .
the other place that was very interested in the urbanism is singapore .
it &apos;s been built two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you &apos;re thinking about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a more sophisticated , and they &apos;re already looking at this area for the second city .
it &apos;s been working on a legal system that allows us to participate , and it &apos;s working on an external system .
a country has already offered its top court to put the top court in the world &apos;s office for the most violent system .
also , the most important and more interested in the world are very interested .
they even bring funding with a profit .
one thing you already know , it has been understood , there &apos;s a lot of plastic .
there are many companies that would like to put in america , especially in a place with a free trade system , and there are many people who would like to live there .
there are 700 million people around the world who say that they like to live in a different place .
a million people leave a year of latin america and travel in the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to leave their families , to get their families to work , sometimes , and they have a single mothers who have to make enough money to eat and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s even children who try to find their parents , who they have , in some cases , haven &apos;t seen any more .
so what is it for an idea to think about this in self-expression , a completely new city ?
or even building these cities , or are they distributed to the world , or hundreds of the world ?
so what is it for an idea to get a choice between a number of cities that are in competition to be new residents ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends from self-expression asked me to say thank you ted .
do you know how many decisions do you do in a typical day ?
do you know how many decisions do you meet in a typical week ?
i recently did a survey with 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that are a typical american , a typical american day .
also , recently a study was made with ceos in which they saw the ceo for a week .
and these scientists just have documented the different themes that are working on these ceo , and how much time they spent decisions to make decisions that are related to the issues .
and they found that a average ceo is busy working in the week with a little bit of time .
each of these subjects were of course , of course , many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions needed an hour or more of their time .
think of your own decisions .
you know how many decisions do you meet in the nine minutes of category in the one hour ?
how good do you think they &apos;re the decisions to deal with ?
today i want to talk about one of the largest most important of our modern time , the most modern .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise it , because i &apos;m blind , just the hand if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , please , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , well , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear something about the most important ?
thank you .
when i was a college student at stanford university , i went to this very very very very very , very intensive store at least , at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was called the most talkative .
this business , it was almost like a computer cap .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and oil and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was a time when we actually drink the most sophisticated .
i loved to go to this business ; but i asked myself , well , how do you get to buy something ?
here &apos;s the olive oil .
they had over 75 different oil types , including the ones that were locked in boxes , which were made by thousands of years old .
so i decided to visit the leader day , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model work that they really offer the people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up the most popular of tourists that came every day and usually had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment and we chose to be a experiment for our experiment .
here &apos;s her favorite gang .
they had a different variety of plastic types .
we set up a little bit of a little bit of business on the entrance of business .
we put six different tastes there , or 24 different tastes , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i &apos;d like to have more people , first , i would like to stay more people and try to get out of it ?
it &apos;s more people standing when it was 24 percent , about 60 percent when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what the people were doing more , and we were going to buy a glass of glass .
now we saw the opposite effect .
and the people who were standing in the world were only three percent , actually , just three percent of the glass .
and the people who are standing there were six , now , we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of glass .
now , if you calculate it , people bought six times a glass of glass , who they had six to the choices when they had 24 to the choices .
now , to decide not to buy glass is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the most important thing is that we can also affect the very very sophisticated decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it &apos;s going to be our own best interests .
so , the theme of the day : financial savings .
i &apos;m going to describe you a study that i &apos;m doing with a computer company , and i &apos;m doing a study of the computer , and i was doing a lot of the decisions that we were doing , and we were looking at the decisions for retirement for nearly a million americans in the entire united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of the people who were able to be able to be able to be able to do a copy of the plan that &apos;s going to affect the probability of the day , could be saved for tomorrow .
and we found that there was a correlation in fact .
so in these plans , we had about a little bit of the plans that people offered something between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund were offered that , in fact , the participation rate was lower .
now , if you look at the extreme , the plans , the two fund , had a more powerful in the &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that almost 60 fund employees , the most common one , the most violent percent of the time .
now , turns out that even if you were to participate in the way that you were , even more options , even then , it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate in the way that the more possibilities were available to you , the more they have been calling it and choose to choose .
the more ways you &apos;ve got to have the more , the more they put their money in pure light .
none of these extreme decisions , to the decisions that someone would recommend , if you care about the future financial well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential negative consequences that offer that to more and more choices with it .
it &apos;s going to push the decision -- push it , even if it &apos;s going to be your own interest .
they &apos;re more likely to make worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to make things that they &apos;re happy to ask themselves less , even if they make it objective better .
the main reason that we can enjoy this is that we may enjoy these huge shelves of the world &apos;s large mustard mustard , mustard , oil and the most important , but we can &apos;t actually pick the comparison and then actually choose something from the fantastic supply .
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested on different kinds of different and different kinds of different types of information -- that they can just apply in their business .
first , just limited .
they &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today that less is more .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; just &quot; short . &quot;
they always worry that they lose their own .
but in fact , we &apos;re always seeing more and more that if you &apos;re ready to be too small , and the more irrelevant ways you &apos;re going to get to the top , you &apos;re going to get the cost of sales , and it &apos;s going to be reduced to the cost of the cost of the world .
as a result , and gamble , the different head of head and the other of 26 to 15 , they experienced a rise of sales to 10 percent .
when the golden corporation sold her 10 at the worst , they were able to have a profit , they found that the profits to grow up 87 percent -- a result of both , the rise of sales and the reduction of cost .
you know , the average average of the day today is to give you 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart is giving you 100,000 products today .
but the most popular supermarket , the world &apos;s supermarket , is the world &apos;s supermarket , and they just offer them 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in a dose .
now in the world of the world &apos;s most important , i think one of the best examples that recently came to the market , about how to best get the choice , was something that david &apos;s very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s offered at harvard .
every single harvard employee is automatically taking a piece of a piece of time .
the ones who really want to make a choice will be offered 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know , how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to just do it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t be able to get them , they can &apos;t do their customers . &quot;
now before we started lunch today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer all of the people in this audience to offer a holiday vacation in the world &apos;s most beautiful road .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read you the way .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a few seconds to read and then please clap them , if you &apos;re ready to take gary &apos;s service .
okay . everybody &apos;s ready to take gary &apos;s service .
are that all ?
well , let me show you something more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who is ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve heard more hands .
good .
the fact is , you see , the first time that you have more information , when the second time , but i would be able to guess it , you know , it &apos;s a real physical thing .
because the images made it real for them .
what brings me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of the world &apos;s problem is the most important .
it &apos;s about understanding people to understand the difference between possibilities , understanding what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that consequences are going to be vivid and specific .
why are people spending average 15 to 30 percent more if they use a credit card or a card card , when they &apos;re a card card ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel that we &apos;re going to be money .
and it turns out that if you make it , something feels like a very good tool , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people .
so we &apos;ve done a study that i did with a computer company , and we &apos;ve done a study of the people who have done a study with people in the field of education -- employees who have been working for the people who were working for their participation -- and these people were all in a meeting they signed their participation .
and as this session , we &apos;ve just leave this meeting as they were always , just we added a little bit .
the little thing we added to it was that we asked people to think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they would save money .
in the way we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation to 20 percent and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or a rise to four percent of the amount that they were willing to pay for the most expensive .
the third technology : the third technology .
we can deal with more categories than more choices than with more choices .
here &apos;s for example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a computer scanner .
it turns out that in the coastal industry , and down in the northeast area , the number between the number of magazines , the number between the different types of magazines to the high magazines , has been up to the top of the magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 papers , and you put them in 10 categories , or i show you 400 papers , and that in 20 categories , you think i &apos;ve given you more choices and a better one than i had given you the 400 .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different types of dna .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; the &quot; jazz &quot; .
if you think that the left display is the left , and the ad on the right is jazz , then they clap into the hands .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
if you think that the on the left is jazz , and the ones on the right is , you know , please clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the left on the left is jazz and the right is a bit of a , but you know what ?
this is a highly crude video of water .
the categories have to say something called the most , not the choice of the choice .
and this problem is often , if you look at the long bullet points all of these fund .
who are you going to do with that ?
my fourth technology : premise for complexity .
it turns out that we can actually deal with more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to increase complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german palestinian , which gives you the opportunity to get your car completely to the rest of your car .
they have to make 62 different decisions to create their car completely .
now , these decisions are different in the number of choices that they provide a decision .
and the car , the car , the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
what i &apos;m doing now is i change the order of the decisions that are going on .
half of the customers are going to be about the many possibilities , 56 , and the low opportunities , four gears .
the other half of the customers are going to be about the low possibilities , four gears , to the 56 percent , many possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how interested they are .
if you use the most expensive thing to do , it means that you &apos;re overwhelmed , the most powerful , i &apos;m losing it .
what you find is that people who go from the many to the low , and over the course of the number of things , they choose the most small .
we lose them .
go from the little choices to the many , then you &apos;ll stay in .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i did is to change the order of this information .
when i start with the simple , i learn how to do it .
even though the gears choose to pick me up , nothing about my preferences in the interior , it &apos;s still going to pick me up .
it also puts me into excitement about the great product that i &apos;m going to be willing to do , and i &apos;m willing to get ready to be interested in interest with interest .
let me summarize .
i told you about four techniques that the problem of the world &apos;s problem -- just -- will be the surplus alternatives ; it &apos;s -- you can do it real ; we can get better , put it on more categories , less opportunities to get less , to complexity .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m describing today is to help you manage the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for people who offer service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re picking up in the selection .
and the more we choose to pick , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin , i &apos;m an kevin , who &apos;s a little bit of youtube , and i &apos;m looking at youtube .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how video spreads , and then , why is that important .
we all want to be stars -- wake up , singer , comedians -- when i was young , that seemed so hard .
but , in fact , the fact that we have allowed us to all be , or all of our creative activities , are very famous in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to the next saturday .
but at youtube , more than 48 hours of video is uploaded to the video .
and again , just a tiny percentage of the time , it &apos;s ever going to be declining and it &apos;s going to look like thousands of times and so on .
so how does that work ?
three things : the more unexpected , the unexpected and unexpected .
well , we want to do that .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
whoa !
so , the computer designer !
last year , the video of this video was sent to this video that he filmed in the high park in the high park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this chart shows how it was , when the video was popular for the first time .
actually , no viral video wanted to do a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing that , if you &apos;re in a high mountain , you &apos;re going to do a $ high mountain .
he had uploaded a lot of plastic samples .
and this video was actually sent in january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jimmy clooney .
jimmy paravicini sent the tweet that was so popular at the end of the video .
because the way jimmy &apos;s first digits are asking us new and interesting things and show them a big audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday . get down on friday on friday . everybody &apos;s got the most powerful to the top , the most cosmopolitan , friday , friday . friday , friday .
rebecca pugh : &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was almost 200 million times .
so the chart looked like this .
just like &quot; double &quot; it seems to be the nothing that seems to be .
what happened to this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also more powerful .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , the most important thing to do is to write a lot of blogs about it .
michael j. nelson &apos;s science theater was a first one who was doing a joke at twitter .
and it &apos;s important that a person or a group of a group of people who took a point of view , with a big audience , shared the process .
then this community formed from people who shared this big joke , and they started talking about it and to spell it to the same .
now there &apos;s 10,000 more of the friday of friday at youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a spoof for every single day .
unlike the most successful conversation of the 20th century , the community is the participation of the community to become part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or something new from it .
&quot; the &quot; cat &apos;s &quot; is animation and music in the world .
that &apos;s it , just simple .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
and if you hold that for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a more powerful one that was seen four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats , looking at this video .
it &apos;s important , creativity , the creativity that &apos;s in the most violent and geeks .
there were remixes .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole whole set of water made out of the ground that made it a stupid joke to something that we all can participate .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure , we &apos;re doing it .
who could have been able to anticipate this ?
who would have predicted &quot; double &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; rebecca black &quot; ?
what would you have to write in the world that was going to be like this ?
in a world where every minute is uploaded two days , only unique and unexpected , as the video is mentioned , it &apos;s just a unique and unexpected video .
i &apos;m not going to be very interested in that , i was not very interested in a friend , i should look at this great video , about a guy who &apos;s in new york against bicycles .
i got a ticket , because i &apos;m not on the top of the street , but there &apos;s a lot of disabilities that don &apos;t get a very nice thing to do on the ground .
and so , there was a very surprising and humorous , casey &apos;s fun idea , and his argument five million times .
this approach is true for everything we do creative .
and that &apos;s all leads to a big question ...
what does that mean ?
so , the math .
what does that mean ?
and the creative design , creative , unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture , to the everybody who has access to the audience and the audience is very evident .
as i said , one of the most big stars -- justin bieber -- made his beginning at youtube .
nobody has to give your ideas green .
and today we &apos;re all feeling as owners of our culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media and they &apos;re not making the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the connectedness between women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of this connectedness is in life of a four year-old girl , when she was about 30 years ago , and her mother and her grandmother is sitting in a small boat , and a victim that &apos;s going to live in the middle of this little girl and never disappeared -- this little girl , which is now in san francisco and a little bit of time .
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still put together .
i want to tell you about some of the most popular things .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man , whose whole life of the simple hope of oneness and freedom of his home .
if you think of it in the front of the gulf of the gulf , you have to be in front of the tree , that his life has been a single waste .
the words , so long his friends , the most long time .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never had to be forgotten to me .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the story was really trying to crush us , but we &apos;re going to go out .
the next puzzle is how a boat in the early winter of the early sea is silent .
my mother may be 18 , when her father died -- already in a nursing marriage , with two little girls .
for you , life had a task : the escape of your family and a new life in australia .
it was completely disconnected that she could fail .
after a four year-olds , a boat , a boat , a boat , quiet , a boat , is quiet .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear they had was the pirates , rape and death .
as most adults on the boat , my mother had a little bit of a plastic card .
in a computer service , i had only my sister and i , then , and i drink it , and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the steady design of the engine , the clapping of the engine , the big and empty horizon .
i remember not to the pirates that came out many times , but from the most of the men on our boat , or the men who were not going to start on our boat , or the motor of the engine , the six hours .
but i remember the lights of the mountain coast of the coast coast , and the young man , who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first , the first one of the men on the platform .
no apple ever tasted this way .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next thing is about four women in three generations , which together are building a new life .
we were leaving in the wild , one of the blue populated catastrophes , whose population is from the street .
unlike the most popular , whose existence was completely unknown to me , there was no more appropriate in the street .
the smell of the world &apos;s heads came from the rest of the world .
and the most broken broken shark system were between people who had one thing in common : they started new .
my mother worked on farms , then on a post in a train store , six days , twice layers .
it was kind of a time to find the time , and they have to have english and family .
we were poor .
every dollar was given , and it was put in another education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to get to it . mostly the new things came out of the second hand .
two of the favorites for school , every one to cover the holes in the other .
a more powerful way to the most cosmopolitan , because they had to have six years .
and there were the rare but painful , and there &apos;s a lot of fun , and there and there &apos;s a lot of time , &quot; asian , goes home . &quot;
after home , where ?
something more nuanced in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a quiet voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered on the boat from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until her nightmares came to come to wake up .
she opened a computer , then she made a business store and opened a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t change change , angry and angry children , and they were caught children , caught between two worlds .
loans and sponsors were looked for .
centers were built .
i lived in a refugee .
in one was the classic asian student , the most violent demands of himself .
in the other , i was in insecure life , which was the tragic scars of violence , the most powerful and the isolation .
but so many of them got help for the years .
and because of this help , i became the last year of the year of the year , as a young boy of the year .
and i was going to be a little bit of a plastic ambassador , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous , anonymous , was now tan le , refugee and social activist , who was invited to talk to places that they never heard , and in homes whose existence would never have imagined .
i was not familiar with the consensus .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the most powerful .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the comfort of life of a unknown , a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who were so natural for each of their days , and they were telling each other to be told , and we still have three times in the same bed .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old , as she was at the time , when we went to the boat .
no one was never a way .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about the design of education and education , and the neglect of the world &apos;s favorite and the absence of the world .
and the more i talked to you , the more i should tell you .
i met people in all the way , so many of you did what they loved , living on the borders of the possible .
and even though i graduated , i realized that i couldn &apos;t get to a career in law .
there had to be another kind of thing .
and i realized that the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , a very , new , new picture , and not just okay , but something that you must be grateful to , maybe a gift of the design .
because the way that we can move to collapse is so easily collapse of the horizons , so easily means you &apos;re accepted the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve gone to a lot of my favorite , and i &apos;ve gone to know that , yes , the world , but not as you do it .
opportunities that were not allowed to be explicitly encouraged .
there was a energy , a credible optimism , a strange soup of humility and the most of the time .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i collected a little team of people to me , for the box , &quot; not a challenge of a challenge .
a year we didn &apos;t have a cent .
at the end of one every stone tag , i cook a huge farm soup that we shared .
we worked late at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant , and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull in the u.s.
after just one journey there .
my gut gut again .
three months later , i moved and the adventure went on .
before i leave the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time where the social norm and the local college was the most important person .
life had not changed since centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother was going to her .
with 17 , she was the second woman of a college whose mother she proposed .
without support of your husband , she was worried about a big , by bringing him to court and was a greater deal , and a greater deal than she won .
&quot; don &apos;t &quot; panic &quot; turns out .
i just had a shower in a hotel hotel in sydney , when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the front of the world and looked at it on the other side .
i knew she was coming to go to him .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in a buddhist temple , and sat around her coffin .
we told her stories and assured her that we were still at her .
and to midnight , the monk came and said he had to close the coffin .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of your hand is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because she &apos;s been holding it for this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t get them up . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s going to be through the women .
you see who we were and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come in our lives would be in the way that we would have come to the agreement .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i think i &apos;m still thinking about the boat .
who would ever want to be a wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , just before , before , before .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous everyone , the wave of the engine , the most powerful , legal , the motor , the long horizon , which doesn &apos;t have anything ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and you could safely be able to do it , i would do it .
and also , the mother &apos;s mother is here in the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it all photography ?
because that &apos;s a picture that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
but i started interested in photography when i got my first digital digital , at age 15 years .
i put it with my former preference for drawing , but it was a little different , because the camera was actually in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you press the trigger .
so for me , photography seemed to be more about being on the right place to be right at the right time .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that the process starts when the trigger is going to get .
photos like this : a construction site along a much more sophisticated road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and yet , a realistic level .
or photos like this -- dark and the same thing , but all of the common goal , to keep a realistic level .
if i say reality , i &apos;m going to be a ph.d.
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but i want to let it look like you could have , on a photograph .
photographs , where you have to think a little moment , to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but then , the last thing we &apos;re doing is how we interpret the world , and how they can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality , where you can take different pieces and put together a alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect things here , and we &apos;ve got physical objects that we can identify all of us in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , they can create something that looks still three-dimensional , as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so we &apos;re trying to do our brains , because our brain is just not really making sense that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combine of photographs .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture of realistic look , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things that we &apos;re not thinking about around us in our lives .
but if we combine photographs , it really matters to think about it , because otherwise you just look wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a realistic outcome .
as you can see , it &apos;s not three special images .
but you can do something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
second , together , photos should have the same thing .
and these two images are going to meet these two demands -- from the same altitude , and the same thing .
third , it &apos;s about making it impossible to make it possible where the individual images begin and end by putting them into a mixed .
it &apos;s impossible to say , how did the photo actually put together .
so by putting color , contrast and contrast to the edges , the individual images , together , put together , like , the color , and the other images , we can see the limits between the different images and the other , and a single photograph , although a picture can basically contain hundreds of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that it &apos;s just a landscape , and the bottom part was manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely composed of photographs of different places .
i personally have a lot of time to create a place to create a place , because you don &apos;t have to make any compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew i needed several months to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been taken on a giant bed .
the bank is from another place .
the most important one comes from a quarry .
and yes , i even have the house up on the island of red to look at it , to look at it .
so to get a realistic outcome , it &apos;s going to be seen from me .
i always start with a act of an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s a very good piece of information .
and then if you make good images , the result is pretty beautiful , and also pretty realistic .
so , there are all tools there , and the only thing that we &apos;re limited to is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic things fail .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we &apos;ve introduced to the most successful was to make a difference .
it &apos;s not particularly scientific , and it &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea , and ask the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how do you ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all of the electronic things -- because we stopped listening .
this is my favorite thing . a very simple thing .
she has a button , and she &apos;s from .
and every morning i get on that .
and yes , i have a job , as you might recognize .
i have my job to be 95 lbs .
it &apos;s just working : every time i get on the scale , they &apos;re also sending my data on google health .
and there are also , you know , from my favorite notebooks , so he can see where my favorite , and it &apos;s not just in the moment that i &apos;m going to support , and that &apos;s not just the moment that i need to take a look at the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you know , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 .
so every morning i jump on my favorite and people talk to me before i sit in the car , &quot; lunch , just a little bit of a little lettuce today , &quot; to lunch . &quot;
but this is the most important thing that can happen because this is the pressure pressure , pressure , to help patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could be patients smoking .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and they get to play together , to play some kind of game , to control their health better .
next week , it comes to the market .
there will be this little little bit of carbon that you &apos;re going to put on a iphone or something like that .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure , to send it to their doctor , to send him to the other , for example , for something more than 100 dollars .
in this point , the patients come in . they can &apos;t only take control of the control , captain on their own ship , but also help us help health care , and the health care system , and the health care system , and so on .
do they make ways that are easy to use and start to hug patients in the team .
and you can do that through these kinds of ways , but also by manifest .
and one of the things that we did , i want to share with you a quick video .
we have all the most sophisticated in our cars .
maybe in our mobile phones .
we know exactly where all the machines around the world are around .
we know one , where all the stations are .
and clear , we can find the more sophisticated .
but where would the next thing that the next day is to help this patient ?
we have a lot of time , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next life-saving shark was going to be in this moment .
so , what did we do ? we did this in the netherlands .
we built a website and asked a crowd , &quot; if you see a computer company , please share with us where he &apos;s , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed during the street .
and over 10,000 years of water , they were reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find apps for this .
and we have designed a design system .
we &apos;ve developed an app for the design system , extended reality to find these kinds of things .
and if you &apos;re in a city like a city of the city , and someone can go down , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks , your favorite , you can save the next one , to save life .
and we don &apos;t want to just do this as a design tool , as the product is called , but also to introduce the product as a result .
and we want to bring this up to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues all over the world , from other universities , to help us behave like the way they behave , to help us to take these kinds of things around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and someone &apos;s going to be collapsing , it &apos;s your own familiarity or somebody else , you can find a more of the kind of a plastic .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies are helping us to help us do this in the world of this kind of thing .
these could be the kind of dna , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the most important thing is that the average is still on its place .
please help us and try and make it not just better , but take the hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
i work in the world &apos;s office .
and my little little bit of the time , we want to make the environment , by doing it ...
... it gives attention to that .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take you to be cut .
now -- we can just skip this -- i &apos;ll just skip the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
so , the name is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design , a year to take away and work in a environment that is so much , which is really what they hate , we have to work in government .
the program is called &quot; code for america &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the most cosmopolitan for geeks .
we &apos;re going to choose some fellows every year and we &apos;re working with a lot of people .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them into a little bit of time .
and they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what you really do is to show what &apos;s possible today with technology .
so they meet al .
al is a computer scientist in boston .
here it looks like he looks for a date , but what he really looks like is someone who &apos;s going to be able to get him out of the street , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at the most violent when he &apos;s a meter of snow .
how did he come to search in this particular way to help ?
we had a team last year of fellows in boston , which is the code for america .
they were in february , and it &apos;s got a lot of fun in february .
and they realized that the city never had this fire fire .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik mcchrystal , noticed something else , and that was that the residents were free to get the sidewalks out of the face right before these parts .
so he did what everybody would do good engineers , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire fire .
you &apos;re going to be free to lift it up when it &apos;s the same .
if you do that , you can give it a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game game .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that have written the fellows in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other kind of thing .
it &apos;s rapidly spreading .
there &apos;s this guy in the middle of the city , which has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but , so the citizens are accepting the citizens to adopt .
it &apos;s very important that these are the most important things that are going to work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to clean the citizens to clean up the people .
and chicago has just introduced them to the people who are the most prolific , if it &apos;s the same .
we know nine cities now that are planning to use this app .
and it &apos;s been distributed , organic , of course .
if you know something about the more sophisticated , you know that it doesn &apos;t usually work .
the software takes a few years to take a few years .
we had a team that worked last year in boston , for the three people needed two months .
it was about a method that parents can find out , which are the right public schools for their children .
we later told us that if it was going to go over the normal channels , it took over two years and it had cost about two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not even nothing .
there &apos;s a project in the california law that has been the taxpayer for two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spreading from the front of the boat , is a kind of shot on the institution of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- not more like a private company , like many people think that she should .
and not even like a car designer , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , this app is that you represents a new generation that &apos;s the problem of government -- not as the problem of a quantum institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at the collective act of digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to make things effectively in common .
it &apos;s not just code for america , there are hundreds of people in all the country , who are up and writing them , every day in their own communities .
they don &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re dreadful frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it .
and these people know something we lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all have your feelings about politics and the snake , and all the other things that we really upset about is government , in the core of tim o o york , &quot; what we &apos;re doing in common , &quot; which we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people have given up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , please , i &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re going to be doing it , because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government finally gives us their strength -- they &apos;re going to be , &quot; we &apos;re going to be the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and as many people , i thought it &apos;s mainly about choosing people in office .
now , after two years , i came to the conclusion that it &apos;s especially in communities to go to the community .
this is the call for service and information .
you usually come out of that when you &apos;re in your city in a nutshell .
if you ever have to work in your life call , in your life call , like our fellow scott , as part of the program -- in fact , do you do that , you &apos;re all going to see that people who call government because of many different problems , including that a computer company is in your house .
so scott gets this kind of thing .
he &apos;s typing &quot; the &quot; aw database &quot; in the official database .
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the most powerful .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock is going to be ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the world &apos;s end .
in boston , not only a call call .
it has an app , a computer , and a computer company , called &quot; the &quot; shhh &quot; .
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work very smart people in the office of the new urban city system in boston .
one day -- this is a real report -- came in , &quot; the &quot; dig in my open . can &apos;t say if she &apos;s dead . &quot;
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; the &quot; design &quot; is different .
scott complained to human beings .
but on &quot; the &quot; road &quot; is all public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post we got was , &quot; i went over there , found the open bottle behind the house .
do you ? yes . alive ? huh .
it turned out the open side . went home .
good night , sweet , sweet . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . this is the digital thing .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is getting into manifest .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i &apos;m not necessarily talking about a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
they were connected to these two people .
and you could have connect them with government services if that would have been needed , but a neighbor is a very much better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if a neighbor helps the other , we &apos;re forcing our communities .
let &apos;s call the most expensive , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about it , that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is choosing .
how often have we chosen a political leader -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we &apos;re going to be going back and we expect the government to reflect our values and then not changed a lot ?
this is because the government is like a further ocean and politics are the top of the top .
and what &apos;s below is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we have , and that we pay for , and for that we pay , something else is working against us , something else , and then we &apos;re going to be ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real estate is happening .
we need to be on the motor of government .
so the most important thing has done .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of more concerned citizens who wrote a very detailed report that &apos;s a very detailed report to the most powerful to the most cosmopolitan .
this is not political , that &apos;s active .
now for those of us who have given up the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world we want to leave our children .
you have to introduce the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we have to reach what we need to do without improving an institution that can be in the name of all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible to make the function of government fundamentally , in a way that can actually achieve a society by being able to overcome society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the internet , and the white internet knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the only systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up with the voice of granted .
they don &apos;t fight this fight that we all fight , so who can talk to who are going to talk .
you can make your opinion , on every channel , every time , and you do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the work of government .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be a fire fire , to ban a trash , a trash with a brick switch with a fire station .
and sure , we would have this fire fire that &apos;s all the time , and many people do it .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers of government , and we &apos;re not just paying consumers to pay and pay .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all got to you here : if it &apos;s about the big , important things we need to do together , all together , we will be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually my role is to explain the people like wonderful technologies , which are the emergence of the rise , and i thought , there i am under friends , i would tell you what i really think is , and i &apos;m going to try to understand what i really think is going on , and to understand what &apos;s really going on , and to understand what &apos;s really going on .
i &apos;m going to start to show you a single one , boring slide .
... you could just show the slide .
this is a slide i &apos;ve chosen from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather about the general form .
this slide shows data of a analysis of the performance of the power of the power of the power of a field of networks of networks .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , as many other , which we often find in our field , is a kind of a kind of a curve curve .
in other words , every step here is a power in the field of power .
and this is a novelty that we need to use this guy to use scale on the area of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the light back .
something more light , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper here .
now , why do we draw graphs in technology on the ground of the world ?
the reason that i was going to draw it on a normal curve , where , say , this is the years , so the timeline of a kind of way , and this is a certain amount of technology that i want to represent with a graph , which is a graph that i want to show you .
and then you see that .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , we &apos;ll say a little bit of a more irrational , then that would be very irrational to the scale of a flat line , in form of a flat line .
but if something like this happens , it changes the most important circumstances .
so if the most fast way of the world &apos;s development would be as fast as the most fast progression , we could get a taxi in a taxi and we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
there was never before the history of the world &apos;s history , this kind of carbon growth , which is the scale of all the few years that the scale is increasing .
the question i want to ask you is , if you look at this exponential curves , you &apos;re not going to go on forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is going to be evolving forever and so fast as it is now .
there are two ways .
either it &apos;s going to be a classic classic , like here , until something completely new , or it will happen here .
that &apos;s about it .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think this is going to happen in the way that you &apos;re going to happen .
it &apos;s really like that , then we &apos;re in the middle of a transition right now .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition of the world , a new way of a world .
so the question i want to ask , and i often think of myself , is how this new world will be ?
what is this new state that takes the world slowly ?
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing when you &apos;re in the middle of the room .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 and people often talked about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
and we &apos;re not going to go on .
so in other words , the future has gone to a year for me to have a year .
i think the reason is that we realize that there &apos;s something that &apos;s happening .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we know that right now , it doesn &apos;t make sense to try to look at 30 or 50 years in the future because everything will be so different that a simple one of what we &apos;re doing now is not a sense of what we &apos;re doing now .
now i want to talk about what that might be , this transition in which we are right now .
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things , which really nothing with technology or computers have to do .
because i think that really , to understand this , we have to go back to a step and look at the thing on a longer divergence .
and i want to look at this in the falkland lobe of life .
i think the big picture makes sense when you split it into some of the most sophisticated .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s 2.5 billion years . the earth was a big , more powerful , a lot of it , with a lot of chemicals .
now , if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized , we have a pretty good picture about how they &apos;re going to be the most good thing .
i also believe there are theories that start to understand how everything has started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about what &apos;s going on , which is that this time , that little oil spill , which contain different kinds of the chemicals for chemicals .
some of these oil spills contain a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from outside and grow .
all the things were , started to tear .
these little oil oil were the most primitive oil systems .
but these oil spills were not about alive in the world , because every single one of them was just a small , spontaneous recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , the chemicals have spread to more unequal amounts of chemicals .
so every droplet was a little different .
in fact , the droplet grew , which had a growth of the growth of the growth , faster than others and integrated more chemicals from outside and shared faster .
so these cases , they tend to survive longer and they planted in the extent of the extent .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting it will be when this droplet learned a trick about abstraction .
in any way that we don &apos;t really understand , this droplet is the ability to learn information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and in a certain chemical form , which we call dna .
in other words , they have found in this kind of state , evolutionary way , which allowed you to have a way of what they were doing , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is to store the time of 2.5 billion years , in which they were born .
in fact , the recipe for us is our genes , from the exact same code and the same notation .
and that &apos;s every living thing that &apos;s used exactly the same letter and the same code .
we &apos;re so far , we can only write , just to the design of the code , even in this code .
and i have 100 of the white pieces of white , which i &apos;m trying to keep in airports from the u.s.
in this , what i did is , i took this code -- the code is made of normal letters , which we use to talk to -- and i wrote my business card on a piece of dna and i wrote it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if someone wants a hundred million copies of my business card , i have enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody on this world , and it &apos;s right here .
i would have been a really , really , in fact , a little bit of a computer , and i would have written it in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna of dna was an interesting step .
and the most important thing that these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and that cells started communicating and exchange information , so that communities of cells came from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
this is why the reason to grow the consistency is to antibiotics .
some bacteria have found out how to stay from penicillin and have this information together with other bacteria in the dna and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate each other .
now this communication allowed the reasons of communities which were in a certain sense in the same boat ; they were a little bit of a sudden .
so they either survived together , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all individuals were more likely to repeat the community , and the evolution of evolution is expected .
now the most important thing is , where these communities are so close to the fact that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community in a more productive way .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at that point , we have a nonprofit community , communities of many of the most sophisticated things that are acting together as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a nonprofit community .
we have a lot of cells that are not left on themselves .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started to develop , so the level , which was the evolution , not longer the individual cell , but the whole cell system , which we call organism .
the next step was now within these communities .
the most important thing began to abstract information .
and they developed special structures which made nothing else than information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the most prolific , which is built these profiles .
they started to train specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and that information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point , an individual -- learning happened in the time of the lifespan of a single organism , rather than about these evolutionary times .
so , an organism could learn to eat a certain fruit , because they didn &apos;t liked to eat and made it sick , the last time he ate her .
now this could happen within the lifespan of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because of that information , it had to be learned by the individuals that have died because of these fruit , because these are not there yet .
so the nervous system has the most dramatic system with this particular kind of carbon system , because evolution could now be within a individual .
she could be in a time of time .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
so , as an example , the most famous version of this kind of thing is the human language .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , very complicated , confused idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and i &apos;m basically giving up the sound of the sound of me , hoping to create a similar idea in your head , which has a certain resemblance with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , it turns out to be a sequence of sound , and it &apos;s producing a sequence of sound , and it &apos;s a very complicated thing to do in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we , we have humanity , is we started abstract .
we &apos;re going through the same stages which have gone through the same , which is the abstraction of our methods , how we capture data , we &apos;re presenting , process .
the invention of language for example was a little step in this direction .
and the computer , computers , the computer , the hypertext and so on , are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also capable of developing faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today , evolution can happen in the era of microseconds .
you &apos;ve also seen a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of evolution where he showed a little bit of evolution in the &quot; the &quot; program &quot; program , right before your eyes .
so we have the most sophisticated time again .
the first steps of history , which i told you , took a billion years a piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , took some hundred million years .
then the steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
and the next steps , like electronics , seem to take a few decades .
the process is feeding itself , and so i think , i think , the word is the word for this -- if something is more profitable .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explosion .
we see the process that &apos;s feeding itself .
i live in a living way of building computers and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism that i use to build computers , not using the past , without the recently progress in computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design this in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is doing in the world &apos;s office .
it has billions of those .
what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking is , we think about a certain kind of a , and we &apos;re thinking about this machine , and the machine makes it something that our skills are far beyond , better and faster than we could ever do .
and it makes it partly with ways that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
a method which is particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been using recently is evolution itself .
we put a solar tag in the machine , which is what &apos;s going on in the field of the brain .
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program which is made out of random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , please , please have a hundred million randomly randomly sequences of instructions .
now , please , all of these random instructions are going to take all of the programs , and finally , they pick up the programs , and finally , the ones that i &apos;m going to do is the next one . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want numbers of numbers that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve been using for this .
so , find programs that can most naturally be possible .
of course , the chance of random instructions is very small , that they just sort of set numbers , so they &apos;re not going to actually do the instructions .
but one of those things that is lucky about happiness is two numbers in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences , which are my goals on the next .
store these , the rest of them .
now all the senior people who have the numbers on the best address .
and that &apos;s a way of the design of the world , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their own , and the children are the characteristics of the world &apos;s properties of the two programs .
so i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that have come closer to the benefits of the other things that are more quickly than others .
say , &quot; please again . &quot;
so , they &apos;re back again .
maybe some mutations are going to be a few mutations .
and try and do this again with another generation .
all of these generations need a few milliseconds .
and so i can run a evolution over millions of years in the computer , and in more complicated cases , some hours .
and finally , i get programs that can be numbers perfectly kind of a way .
the fact is , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i &apos;ve ever written from hand .
and then if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s obscure and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure that you do the job , because you come from a series of a series of programs that have done the job .
because your life was on whether you did the job right .
i sat in a 747 with marvin minsky , and he &apos;s a map of a map of a card , and he says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
there &apos;s this airplane , &quot; this airplane is made of a plastic , which is working together to make your flight safer . &quot;
we know that a computer company is not optimal when it becomes too complicated .
so we start to leave the computer for a process which is very different from the classical engineering engineering .
he allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than the normal methods would allow .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibility of this .
so , we &apos;re doing the technology .
we use these programs now to make the computer much faster , so we can do that , and we can do this processes even faster .
so it &apos;s created a more powerful .
it &apos;s going to be faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies of today are feeding themselves .
we &apos;re going to raise .
we &apos;re at a point that is analog to the back of the world , as a result of being developed .
so we &apos;re the most important and we can &apos;t quite make what the hell we &apos;re doing here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this lake .
but i really think that after us , something is coming .
i think it &apos;s very much more powerful to say that we are the most successful of evolution .
and i think we all are part of the creation of what &apos;s going on next .
now , lunch is before and i think i &apos;m going to hear here before i &apos;m going to get more and more .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert with a plastic of the sky with a computer company .
we talked about it , nothing has changed since the era of ancient indian media . &quot;
if we wanted to travel indians at the time , we were going to go into a car and the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
and then when the great indian computer festival had a bow , he took a bow , fired in the floor and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with a computer and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that really made me sad .
i was scared of technology .
it was scared that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without a camera and without tweet to my friends .
i found that technology should make magic and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver chip .
this piece of 50 years old was the most powerful thing for me .
she became a more responsible access to a world full of pirates and the ships in my imagination .
i came to dream as thought of our own clocks and cameras from the way to dream .
they were inspired by us .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic rather than killing .
i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling , the readers on the whole world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it takes pictures and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
the storytelling always took more sense .
but what do we do with that ?
i &apos;m just going to go to the street , an interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s &quot; take your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to get a character in the book .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad knows through gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the child in me is really excited about this possibility .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean a magician , and the dragons , but the magic of childhood , those ideas we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i found always quite exciting .
so you have to blow up the ipad and the fireflies are falling down .
and the light is the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that was fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put a whole galaxy in a single set of a window .
and so every book is going to be a little bit of a big portal that i &apos;m going to put here to the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
and the whole thing was , they &apos;ve always had maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows and it &apos;s shining and it &apos;s going to be the guidance of the book .
it also shows other places in the book .
i &apos;m going to go in here .
it &apos;s also important for me to create something that is also very , very highly balanced .
this is the most profound .
we &apos;ve heard all of the data and the most powerful , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the most powerful ?
the poor were caught thousands of years in southern chambers , in a old book book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary history for children .
a story that has been faced with new issues like the most important .
the theme of the last 10 years , a big problem of the last 10 years is that children are sitting in their rooms , without walking out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you have to go out and collect the camera of the ipads of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of the wooden stones , rocks , and currents .
somehow , the kids don &apos;t do it anymore .
this is going to be brought up . you have to go out to make a picture of a flower , and tag a photograph .
in another chapter , you have to highlight a piece of a piece of water and tag .
so , you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can put online .
a child in london shows the picture of a football and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities that are magic , the world and technology to connect with each other .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning to use an interaction where you use the video of the ipads and see augmented reality , which looks at a plant of the house that appears to be a plant before the house .
and on a place , the screen is filling up with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the brain &apos;s sound , you break and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the natural forces of technology are closer and in the magic and technology can come back .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and we &apos;re closer to the natural world , and the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really a remarkable honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in the prison , prisons or prison .
i spend most of my time with the socially weakest in the world &apos;s most common and places that there are a lot of despair .
here at ted , to see and hear how stimulating this is , i have a lot of force .
in the short time here , i was clear , ted has a identity .
you can tell things that have influence the world .
and sometimes , if something comes over ted , it gets a meaning and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we saw some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher have meaning , but the words of a dedicated teacher are particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional household household , which was dominated by a matriarch , and these matriarch was my grandmother .
she was a very strong , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every single single day .
she was also the starting point of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a football machine .
their parents were born in the olduvai 40s in virginia as a slave .
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped her view very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met them as a young boy , she came to me and gave me a return .
they kept me so stuck , i couldn &apos;t breathe . then they got me .
one or two hours later , if i came to her , she came to me and said , &quot; do you feel like , &quot; do you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; i said , &quot; i said , &quot; yes , i said , &quot; yes , she said me in quiet .
and she was something that was made that you wanted to be close to her .
the only problem that was that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins walked around everywhere .
i remember , i have to be eight or nine , that i woke up one morning and went to the living room . all my cousins went around .
my grandmother was at the end of the room and i was staring at it .
first , i thought that was a game .
i saw her and she was smiling , but she was very serious .
that was 15 or 20 minutes , and then she stood up and came to me . she took me on the hand and said , &quot; come on , &quot; come on . you have to talk . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out and said , &quot; i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to tell you that you don &apos;t have to be able to get it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me three things , &quot; you know . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i &apos;m going to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby and you have to have to be with promise you &apos;re going to take care of them . &quot;
i &apos;m going to admit my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and she said , &quot; next to me , you &apos;ll always do the right thing , &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing .
i thought , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
and finally she said , &quot; the last thing you need to promise me is &quot; that you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the land , in the old , rural south and i have a brother who &apos;s older , and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , my brother came home and brought this kind of beer beer with me , and i went to the forest and went to the forest .
we just put around the way it &apos;s like that .
then he took a drink of beer and offered my sister &apos;s , and she took me , and then she offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . ok . just do it . i don &apos;t want to do beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , now we &apos;re doing this , you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re also doing anything that we do .
i had what , your sister had what , you know , a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . just do it . just do it . &quot;
my brother fell on me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , what do you do ? &quot;
and then he looked at me and said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t always do you crazy because of the conversation with grandma ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells everybody that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to admit something .
i should not do that .
this is perhaps going to be publicly transmitted .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m going to be a drop of alcohol , i &apos;ve never drink a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s a lot of the time , i say that &apos;s because identity means it means it &apos;s identity .
if we create the right way of identity , we can tell people about things that they don &apos;t believe in first .
we can get them to do things that they thought they could not .
of course , my grandmother would say all of her grandchildren , they &apos;re special .
my grandfather was during the prison prison in prison .
my uncle died in the field of disease .
and she believed that this is the themes that we need to care about .
i tried to say something about our system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1957 , 300,000 people were in the prison and in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest rate of the world .
seven million people are on the ground , or with spontaneous fission .
i think , in my opinion , our world is fundamentally changing .
in social and black parts of the population , despair and hopelessness are given despair , because of this changes .
one of three male black black black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , on the los school , or with spontaneous fission .
in urban communities everywhere in the country -- los angeles over philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of all black men men in prison , in prison , on the los school , on the los angeles .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have been made with the data of the world , it &apos;s also being loaded by poverty .
we have a non-profit system that you &apos;re treated much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty as poor and innocent .
wealth , not budgets , affects the outcome .
but we seem to be very happy with it .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a couple of things that are there .
my home home of alabama is permanently pushed the right to the right when they &apos;re convicted .
here and today in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population is permanently lost their right .
we predict that in 10 years the percentage of the civic population is going to be so high as the most potent of the human race .
the silence is a little bit of a silent .
i represent kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world , the most powerful kids in jail .
in this country , there &apos;s a lifetime of children &apos;s lives for children &apos;s lives .
we &apos;ve got a lot of work .
the only country in the world .
i represent people in the world .
the death penalty question is a interesting question .
we think because you &apos;ve taught us that the true question is : has a human being made for a person to die for him ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other view is not : does anybody deserve death for a crime , but do we have it to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty in america defined by error .
in nine people we &apos;ve executed , one that we &apos;ve been executed for innocent , which was the improbability and from death row .
an amazing thing . one of nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane if for nine planes , which will go , one crash .
but somehow we do it , we &apos;re going to be able to do this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking about this question .
i talk about race and the question , if we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m my students &apos; african story , i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , the time against the end of the recovery , until the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
but for the african-american men in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to fear .
or before bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
these older people are coming to me and say , &quot; mr , maureen , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re talking to people that you should stop saying that we should stop doing it for the first time in our nation , for the 11th of september . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with this . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the conservative and decades of the world &apos;s motivated match and apartheid .
and yet , there &apos;s a dynamic in our country , and we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what the meaning of our actions have in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly breaking together .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to be able to get us to the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the extracellular is not to overcome the willingness to be the willingness to be true and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve been given some talks in germany about death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply troubling , you &apos;re talking about listening . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , it can never give you more . &quot;
it was still silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever kill ourselves for the systematic killing of people .
it would be a little bit more accurate from us , consciously , and we &apos;re aware of people . &quot;
i thought about it .
as it would feel , in a world where german state people had made people who were born , especially if they were a lot of jews , they were especially , in fact , a lot of jews .
it would be testable .
it would be a little bit more powerful .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we &apos;re going to go to people -- here &apos;s the risk of death , 11 times higher when the victim is white , 11 times higher when the victim is black , and the victim knows -- in the same states , in their own bodies , the body is going to wash people .
and yet there &apos;s this mental disconnection .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with that , with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities are going to be driven by suffering , abuse , nato , apartheid .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we ultimately talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to can be able to be able to be able to be able to be in complex world .
for me , it means time to think about the poor , and talk about the poor , the vulnerable , the ones that are never going to be at ted .
but think about a way of being integrated in our own lives .
we all have to believe the last thing we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re so rational , so we value intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development , not only come from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this kind of thing that i think is driving us , not just being open to all the light and the things that are the dark and the dark and the dark and the dark .
lima ebert : the great news of politicians , once said ,
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe , we wanted to do everything . but what we needed most was hope , a mental guidance , the willingness to be a mental guidance , and to be the willingness to be honest . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i think is also the most important thing to do .
there &apos;s no distinction to technology and design that allows us to be human , and as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , apartheid and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity challenges very much more from us than if we didn &apos;t have to do that .
it &apos;s going to touch it deeply .
as a young lawyer , i &apos;m going to meet the great privilege , pink parks .
and again , a woman &apos;s house came back to the back of the city , where she was two of her oldest friends , who were the older women , who had the most organized women , who had organized the most amazing women , and virginia , a white , whose husband , who &apos;s a husband , who &apos;s a husband , dr. king
so these women were going to come and know .
and then , i started calling up , and then she said , &quot; well , &quot; i &apos;m going to go , &quot; i &apos;m going to go , &quot; i want to talk to you , &quot; we want to talk .
do you want to go in and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very like . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just heard .
it was always so inspiring , so it was so inspiring .
one day i sat there and i heard these women , and after a few hours , woman parks to me , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to say , what &apos;s the same thing to be the same thing ?
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to put on injustice .
and the people who are willing to help people who were innocent .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the field of the world .
we want to eliminate the global power of life without any kind of time for children .
we want to do something about death penalty .
we want to reduce the number of death rates .
we want to eliminate the food system . &quot;
i thought my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to go . &quot;
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
and then woman was rejected to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and therefore , you have to be very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very careful . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be the ted community .
we need to make ways of asking ourselves to make these challenges : these problems , this suffering .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
i &apos;ve learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a few very simple things .
that we all are more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every person on the planet .
if someone lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t hear him , he &apos;s not just a secondary .
even who kills someone , not only a murderer .
and because that &apos;s what &apos;s like , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that has to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with safety in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think that in many places the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so inspiring , we &apos;re not going to be measured at the end of our technology , not to the things we &apos;re developing , not our intellect and minds .
finally , a society is not measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged , but how they deal with the poor , the death row , the prisoners , the native people .
because in this context , we start to understand the real amazing things that make us feel .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story to end .
sometimes i urge too much .
i &apos;m going to be tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas are ahead of our thinking , in very important ways .
i represent these kids who were very hard to be convicted of very hard .
i go to the training and visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and the adult is supposed to be a nurse .
then i wonder , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn someone into something that he doesn &apos;t ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed at a long time , and i thought my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he has to have a lot of time .
right , the judge , the judge has a lot of time .
you should also have to do that .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think of it right , i started working on a bill .
i had a 14 year-old boy , poor black boys .
and i started with this bill . the headline was , &quot; bill , my arms , 14 black clients like a privileged , white , white , white , white , &quot; to treat . &quot;
in my bill , i explained that failure is the most painful and the police and the police .
there was a crazy line about this in this country that there &apos;s nothing more to be more error .
the next morning , i woke up and didn &apos;t know if i was just dreaming about this crazy bill , or actually written him .
and i didn &apos;t just write him , but sent it to the court .
a few months went over and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to the court and i &apos;m going to talk to you about this crazy case .
i went to the car , and i was really overwhelmed with it .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard to do that .
finally , i went out of my car and went up to the court .
when i was the staircase to the court , there was a elderly , black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came over and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and gave me a return .
then he was filming me in the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched something very deep in me , identity , the ability to help each individual , to a community of hope .
well , i went to the front of the street .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. lessig , did you put this crazy bill ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to argue .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
i had written these crazy things .
and the main director came in and forth and office workers .
in the most violent , the most popular thing was , the most angry , that we were angry , that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
i looked at the janitors , and i went down .
he always saw over the window and he could hear the whole thing .
he went down and down .
finally , this older black man came with a very , very accomplished in the kitchen and sat down straight behind me , almost on the top of the street .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
during the break , a computer worker came in , which was that the janitors were in the prison room .
this is the most profound run across the elderly .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the world &apos;s office ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he saw the most popular , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say that boy &apos;s not going to be the eyes . give it to the goal . &quot;
i came to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far more sophisticated , but that it &apos;s the justice of justice .
that we &apos;re not completely designed as humans , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and environmental rights .
that our survival of survival is connected to each individual .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and design , entertainment and creativity with humanity , pity and justice .
and most of all , i want to tell you that that &apos;s just just saying , &quot; don &apos;t lose the goal of the eyes . give it not . &quot;
they have seen this audience , this community , a obvious wish , and i heard you to help them and do something .
what can we do ?
so , the lima builder : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a kind of a spring , where it &apos;s about , actually , a effort to do something about the most important , something that &apos;s going to be going on in politics , which is otherwise flowing in politics .
here , in california , for example , you will be a billion dollars for the death penalty , a billion dollars for death penalty .
and yet , 46 percent of all the world &apos;s population is not with a conviction .
56 percent of all the world &apos;s population is not coming before court .
there &apos;s the chance to do something .
this is a little bit of the money that will be willing to invest in more and more security and security .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the most powerful in america is extremely decreased .
this is a fact that often put in a context with the increased growth rate .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
now , in fact , the number of the people &apos;s numbers didn &apos;t change very much .
most of the most popular in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of the world &apos;s class .
it was the most popular mathematician against drugs .
so the dramatic numbers come to the prisoners .
we have a little bit of the rhetoric of the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have &quot; the &quot; design &quot; that people have to bring up the grid for the grid for a more , for a more responsible , for the theft of the theft of good , rather than that you force them to give up the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a computer of a child &apos;s disease .
and i think our current current is not helping us .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
and you &apos;ve got a string of string , you &apos;ve got a string of power .
they &apos;re an inspirational personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
bin laden is taking a higher increase with himself .
famine in somalia . 3 : spray of the police .
four : an outbreak of four : dangerous , dangerous , dangerous .
six : social decline . 6 : 65 dead .
eight : eight : eight : eight .
different speakers : mass destruction . tornado .
recession . a standstill . the egypt . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative themes , because our minds are given attention to this particular thing .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second every day , our senses will start much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first station is the first station for all the information that the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early detection system , our main system .
it monitors and the whole information on the search of any relationship for any relationship in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look at negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; if it &apos;s going to be , the demand is very true .
now , with all our digital devices that we have seven days the week , 24 hours a day , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that it &apos;s always worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
perhaps the enormous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century is made by a series of forces that we have in the next three decades , so that it will be possible to create a world of abundance .
well , i &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have a big problem -- climate crisis , water , water , water and energy problems -- we &apos;ve already got .
and as humans , we are much better at doing problems on very long , but they eventually overcome it .
so let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , which has been devoted to inflation in the world &apos;s length of inflation .
child mortality has reduced a tenth .
and that &apos;s where the most important , the most important , and the energy community , and it &apos;s reduced to a risk of risk .
steve pinker showed us that we &apos;re living in a very peaceful time of the world &apos;s life .
and according to charles dickens , the most recent in the past 130 years is up to 80 percent of the year .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations constantly .
in fact , we have redefined poverty .
remember that a large fraction of americans who live under poverty , access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , tv , mobile , air , air cells and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the most important of the earth , would never have been able to dream such luxury .
the basis for a lot of it is to form technologies , and these are growing up .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that will become information technology is a big driver &apos;s trajectory , and the most 12 to 24 months doubled .
so that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less and less than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how smooth you are -- in good times , war or peace , recession , recession , depression and the world &apos;s disease .
this is the result of faster computers , building faster computers .
it &apos;s slowed down for none of our big problems .
and also , despite their logarithmic , the left on the left , she &apos;s going up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to all of us .
&quot; the &quot; shhh , &quot; something that my friends call in autodesk , sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers , the 3d printer that allow us to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , and artificial intelligence , and artificial intelligence , and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm supercomputer at risk ?
that was great .
i &apos;ve been looking at the newspapers and looking for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson &apos;s human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence is available to each owner of a child &apos;s own .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i here at ted is a new university called singularity university .
we bring our students all these technologies , and we &apos;re going to focus on how these are used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students , businesses , products and services , which can affect a decade of positive lives of people .
think about that , a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this was ridiculous .
today we can refer to dozens of companies that have done this .
if i think of creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for every one on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating a mile from 100 goods .
because scarcity is a lot of the time , and technology is a resource of a viable force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of world-changing , in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of the dinner to dinner .
and soldiers got a lot of time , and they got a memorable self .
but the king of the king of the day was got a lot of time .
aluminum was at this time the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and platinum .
this is why the dome of the internet was made from aluminum .
even though aluminum grier takes percent of the world &apos;s energy , it &apos;s not as pure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and water .
but then the technology of the internet technology was developed and made production so cheap that we use it with our own business .
and then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we think of it today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet of the more energy with more energy than we use a year .
16 of the energy energy energy is all the 88 minutes on the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time to reduce the cost of solar power in india -- the most successful rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy dropped over 50 percent .
last month , this has published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the united states of solar solar solar , the cost of solar energy is going to cost to 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have a excess energy , we &apos;ll also have water in the abundance .
let &apos;s talk about the design .
do you remember carl sagan , when it was the most successful , when it was saturn , when it was saturn , back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a &quot; a blue blue enzyme . &quot;
because we live on a giant life .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s a water of water , two percent of the water , and we &apos;re fighting about 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new media projects on the way , the way it &apos;s .
and from a conversation today with dean ornish , one of the innovators of doing it , i want to share something with you -- he gave me permission -- his favorite , the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; of a car . &quot;
it can generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day -- whether water , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents per gallon .
the president of coca-cola has just been a big , big , big deal of a hundred units in developing countries .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola will apply this technology globally to the planet in the whole planet .
this is a huge innovation that &apos;s now available today .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
you mean , my goodness , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent of mobile phones in the developing world to the end of 2013 .
just think that a computer cell with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better amount of energy than president reagan in the middle of 25 years ago .
and if you look at your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowing and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the abundance of how nobody could have ever predict .
and it &apos;s better , the things that you and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , the , and the photograph , libraries of books and music , technology to medical diagnostics -- now literally , literally , and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best thing is perhaps what &apos;s expected to do in health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure of the pleasure that &apos;s called &quot; $ 10 million million bucks &quot; to announce x prize .
we &apos;re asking teams all over the world , all these technologies together to connect to a mobile phone that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equipped with ai , you can test it or test your own .
and to win , the device needs to make a better diagnosis than a team of doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of the health care and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
if this device sequenced a computer or a computer company , which is not known , it &apos;s called the world &apos;s disease , and it prevents a pandemic before her outbreak .
but now the biggest force that we &apos;re going to do is lead to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the most sophisticated .
and by the way , the biggest oil industry against a population explosion is a better education and nutrition in the world .
in 2010 , we had just been connected to two billion people online .
until 2020 , we go to the floor of two billion internet users .
three billion new heads that we &apos;ve never heard before , will be the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what will they want ?
and instead of economic gridlock , i see one of the largest economic development systems of history .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars that are going to flow into global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier , and they &apos;re trained to be trained by the most expensive , and they &apos;re going to be trained to use 3d printers and , &quot; well , that they &apos;re going to be using 3d printers and &quot; more productive than ever before . &quot;
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the world &apos;s population ?
as it would be with a set of new , never before , ever before .
how would it be , the oppressed , where they &apos;re , to give a voice to make attention and make change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
how about the design of the world that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i learned through the x prize is that small teams that are motivated by passion and focus are capable of creating extraordinary things , things that could only create big companies and governments in the past .
i want to close with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might already know .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
it was developed in seattle from washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to evolve .
and the way we can predict the structure , and function , we can predict the structure .
and this is very important in the world &apos;s office .
so this is a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university professors .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online .
and it showed that today the human pattern pattern is better than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked at who &apos;s the best of the world , this was not a research , no more a , it was a woman , the manchester , a woman who was a assistant in the day of the day , and at night the best most powerful of the world was the best of the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to put us in the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to the tools with an exponential technology .
we have the passion of a computer .
we have the capital of the world &apos;s capital .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work online to solve the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s needed .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to have something about a computer of medical culture business .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor , and i &apos;m .
and maybe i &apos;m a long time in business , as i can allow it to give me a piece of my own wrong wrong , to allow this to happen .
but before i &apos;m talking to the actual topic of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re the most close to the world &apos;s population , and we &apos;re moving to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; the &quot; aw &quot; appears soon and turns around statistics and to use this great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to be able to get a statistic from that i hope most of you have heard .
it &apos;s the most powerful of the internet .
we talk about a 300 , if a bat hits 300 .
that means that the player is safe to beat three of 10 beats .
that &apos;s called the ball to the dance , he &apos;s going to be caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball to the first base , it didn &apos;t have done in time and the trajectory was in safety .
three of 10 .
do you know how to call a laser in a liberal league of baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a more powerful .
do you know how to call a car company ?
this is a guy who &apos;s probably in the rest of the rest of the 10 .
and the ted of the ted -- like ted williams -- the last ted league baseball players , who met during a regular season of 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot more comfortable or maybe a little less likely to be talked about that .
imagine a computer company and you &apos;re going to be able to put a computer tag on a computer , whose favorite 400 in terms of the brain is in terms of the brain .
somehow , does it work , right ?
imagine life in a certain remote area and you have a beloved person with clogged , and your favorite people with a little bit of a sudden , and you have a little bit of a life of the day that &apos;s in 200 .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better . it &apos;s on the schedule .
and she &apos;s beating a video .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the most important thing for a child or a nurse or a nurse , a more powerful , a computer company should be a more powerful one ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody knows all the medicine , which is a good surgeon or a doctor or a doctor .
but what we do is we &apos;re in every one of them , including me , in the world , to be perfect .
never make a mistake , but no one does it , but the details of how to do this is to be done .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was a tactile student student .
in high school , a school meeting said that brian would learn for a blood test .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little little wine in the sisters in the toronto , general hospital , in the toronto hospital .
i learned everything .
in my favorite school , i learned the origins and the tail every single branch of every branch of every branch , which is from the aorta , obscure and ordinary , ordinary .
i even knew the most popular thing to classify the most sophisticated computer technology .
and i &apos;ve been collecting more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i was going to cut out with a little bit of time .
and i left the medical school with the impression that i knew if i knew everything and knew everything , or at least as much as possible , so close to how possible i could do immune to the mistakes .
and it worked for a time until i met a woman &apos;s printer .
i was going to be in a teaching school here in toronto as a woman , and i was brought into the hospital &apos;s office of the hospital .
and at that point , i was covering the most popular layer in the service service .
and it was my mission when the most popular advice was looking for the most popular advice .
and to give feedback to my favorite .
i studied a woman &apos;s printer and she was in a refugee .
and when i read her , she made sound sound .
and when i was with her chest with the most violent sound , i could hear a sound of sound on both sides that said she was suffering under the heart failure .
this is a state that fails to fall the heart , instead of pump the entire blood on the lung , and it &apos;s a part of the blood cells in the lung , and it &apos;s going to be the beginning of the blood , so the most important one came .
and that was not a hard diagnosis to be diagnosed with .
i put them and made me care about the treatment .
i gave her an unthinkable . i gave her a drug to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call the water pills , water pills , so they &apos;re going to be the fluid .
and over a period of a period of a year , it started to feel better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
i actually made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my favorite book .
i didn &apos;t take the reward and did what i should have had , what would have been a call in my book , so that he had a chance to make a picture .
and he knew she was able to be able to get more information to her .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the doctor &apos;s doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility that i was so able to make my patients feel without having to contact it .
my second mistake was worse .
and that &apos;s what i sent to you home , i &apos;m a quiet voice in me , trying to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . do not do that . &quot;
in fact , i was very upset with the nurse that i asked the nurse , which was the nurse who was taking care of the printer , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay if you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and he said in the way , &quot; yeah , i think it will go well . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
so i raised the most violent and an ambulance and an ambulance and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this nagging feeling in my stomach .
but i continued to work .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , down the hospital and went to a parking car to drive home with the car , when i did something else that i didn &apos;t do .
i went home through the street of my way home .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen the wife &apos;s printer , but another three words to me and fear that most of the words that i know most of the time .
other medical doctors fear that , but the care care is very , very special because we just see the patient as well .
the three words loud : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient you thought of home ? &quot;
asked the nurse to be the girl &apos;s nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular kind of thing .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
about an hour after that , after i had sent her home , she collapsed and she called the family , and the family called 911 . the most dangerous they brought back to the top of a 50 , which is a dangerous thing .
they barely breathe and was blue .
the most important thing was that all the strands .
they gave her their own business .
they were wearing them on the top of the street .
i was shocked and to the inner school .
and i &apos;m living through this rollercoaster because she came to the intensive care industry , and i hoped she would recover .
and after two , three days , they realized that they never would again be hacked .
she didn &apos;t have a failed breakfast system .
their family gathered together .
and the next eight or nine days , they led to the most salient .
on the top day , she &apos;s going to go to her -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say that you never forget the names of the world &apos;s names .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
the next weeks i was asking , and i learned to be the first time myself , the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame you feel because you can &apos;t talk about the colleagues about it .
you all know the healthy shame if you give a secret of the best friend , even though this one on the street is on a surface of the day and you get the best friend to do it and then you get a terrible discussion , and you &apos;re going to get a terrible discussion , and you &apos;re never going to do that again .
if you do it , you never do the mistakes and you never do the mistake again .
this is the kind of high-tech shame .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is that it &apos;s going to make a clean sick .
it &apos;s the one who says that it &apos;s not what you did , but you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t on my own , he was very happy .
he spoke with the family and i &apos;m sure he was the number of the things that he was doing , and sure i was not sued .
but i asked myself to ask these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the ted card ? why did i send them home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why went to medicine ?
but slowly , it &apos;s got to be .
i started feeling better .
and then on a day day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke up and i could be able to feel better again .
and i was with me that if i had doubled my efforts to perfection , and never again missed a mistake that the voice could be .
and she did .
and i continued to work .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the prison hospital in a hospital hospital north of toronto and i was licensed to a 25 year-old man with a young man with a little bit of old man .
it was a lot of time and i was in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked at the most of the time , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and even as he went out of the door , he showed up his shoulder .
two days later , i came to my next day , and my favorite book asked me to talk to her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the patient &apos;s disease ? &quot;
it turns out he was a more responsible .
he had a potentially potentially a liberal disease called the &quot; car . &quot;
you can google the google , but it &apos;s not infection of the top , but the top of the body is causing the beating and causes the top of the body .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got a little bit of a time , and he recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same kind of error of shame and self-doubt , and i felt free and went to work to work and again and again .
in a more mature , i have two times a more threatening .
there &apos;s a lot of time that you think about it , especially if you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital that had only 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home and there was no cure in their treatment .
i thought he had a thought of it .
i &apos;m going to be the x-ray of the kidney , and when it was without a computer designer , my colleague was in the middle of the patient &apos;s office , and called the surgeons in the lower right sector , and called the surgeons .
the other had strong diarrhea .
i &apos;m going to go to the street to put him on him and asked my colleagues also to tell him .
and he did and he did a little lower in the right sector , he called the surgeons .
in both cases , it was a lot of time , and it was good .
both cases of mine , i &apos;m on , i &apos;m going to go .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues , but total nonsense .
some of my favorite projects happened in the last five years .
alone , and without support , and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t close with my mistakes and talk about them , if i can &apos;t tell the quiet voice that i can tell you what &apos;s really happening , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i had a room -- like now , i don &apos;t know what you think about me .
when did you hear the last time of somebody who talked about the ted of the world &apos;s disease over the past time ?
oh yes , you go to a cocktail party and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about your own mistakes .
if i had a full one in a room with colleagues and ask her immediate support , and to tell them what i just told you , i would not be able to get the end of the second story before it really would be uncomfortable , and they would change the rest of the world .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues that a computer company would have lost the wrong leg in my hospital , you think i would have trouble looking at it in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do . those who are sleeping , the ones who are sleeping and the ones that are with bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological reaction like antibodies that attack a human .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we do the ones that make mistakes from medicine , we &apos;re going to have a safe system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of medical school , and journalism , i have a personal medical study about medical errors and wrong treatments to make all of me possible for one of my first articles , which i wrote for the toronto star star , black style , black style , wrote .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely valid .
we &apos;re working in a system that &apos;s going to happen every day in which one of 10 is either a false or wrong , and it &apos;s a false or more important , and the destruction of the death is going to cause and the destruction or dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians die in the state of the mistakes .
in the united states , the institute of medicine are the number of 100,000 .
both of these are strong , because we don &apos;t think about the problem that we should .
and is the most important thing .
in a more mature place that the medical knowledge is doubling all two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
sleep is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake , so we can take a perfect diagnostic for a patient with chest chest pain .
then i take the same patient with a computer company , making it a little bit more powerful and more , and i &apos;ll give you a little bit of a breath and suddenly , and then the story is saturated with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same course .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they tell me their symptoms not always in the same way .
all of this is inevitable .
so if you take the system like that , how i &apos;ve been taught , and all the most sophisticated people , they &apos;re not going to be left .
and you know the most important thing about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white &quot; , black , black , i have the habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake to everybody from the most violent to the ted center of the world &apos;s favorite , &quot; this is my worst mistake , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , &quot; what about your ? &quot;
and then their pupils expand , they &apos;re left from the head , and they look down and they &apos;re getting hard to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what you need is a environment that you can do in the position .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new way to be defined is a human being , white , to be accepted , and it &apos;s not proud of making mistakes , but it &apos;s all about learning to learn about it .
they share their experiences with other people .
they supported when others are talking about their mistakes .
and it shows other people &apos;s mistakes , not about the most violent , but in a loving , supportive way that all of them benefit .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life and when that is , then people make mistakes of time .
so that the system is developing , which is what it makes easier to find mistakes that are inevitable , and it allows people to create the spaces that are actually going to be seen , and they can actually respond to the people who are going to be able to do the health and the other thing that &apos;s going to be the potential for the most important of these reward . and that &apos;s what the potential of the reward of these reward should be rewarded .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the new doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i &apos;m making mistakes .
i &apos;m actually doing a job of learning , but i &apos;m trying to learn best to learn to give it to others .
i don &apos;t know what they &apos;re holding from me , but i can live with it .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about the most sophisticated .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories before that time to use time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he &apos;s in 1978 here .
you might think he &apos;s selling the gun , but it &apos;s not true .
actually , he collected fish .
he described one of them as a very , &quot; usual . &quot;
it was a very reactive .
until the 1980s , he was stuck in great style .
now he &apos;s listed in the red list .
this story we heard many times from the galapagos or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we still come on the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the most popular thing is , they still describe as a pristine .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is to make a different concept , the most powerful , the most important thing .
because i &apos;ve experienced it when i was in 1971 in 1971 .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad indoor , and i was convinced that i really didn &apos;t get there .
it was my first bleeding .
as you see , the lagoon was from the palms and a few trees .
there were a lot of about 20 inches , and there was a subset of the world &apos;s population .
the shipping of these twin people were very productive and the fishermen lived well , and they were making a lot of good things in ghana .
when i returned 27 years later , the fish was reduced to half of his size .
adult measures they are five centimeters .
they were genetically modified .
it was still fish .
people still were happy .
and the fish also had the happiness to be there .
so it doesn &apos;t change anything , and yet it has changed everything .
my third little story tells me about my favorite story in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- more to the &apos; 60s -- the most of the most powerful europe -- a lot of the u.s.
and the world &apos;s countries that were already starting to have 100,000 fish that started the industrial fishing ship that &apos;s pretty ugly ship .
i went to this , and we made the census of the southern sea , and especially in the southern sea .
we had no words for what we started there .
i know that it was the reason the ocean was .
90 percent of our most common ones were sponges , other animals that are connected to the bottom .
the largest part of the fish , the little dots there on the rubble , the most expensive , were the most cosmopolitan .
basically , the bottom of the ocean came down and then turned down .
these images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you have a survey and then starts with the commercial fishing .
the reason is , it &apos;s going to change -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft coral is going to be a crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , you threw them away because they were dead .
once we started a living alive .
she wasn &apos;t drowning .
then they wanted to kill them because they could eat it well .
in fact , this mountain of darfur is being raised by fishermen every time they drive in areas where they &apos;re never born .
it &apos;s not going to be documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we &apos;re looking at our new level of the new level and we don &apos;t call ourselves in memory , which was there .
if you &apos;re going to get it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis , a few good things : biodiversity , number of the most profound , the green of your country , the green .
it &apos;s changing . it changes because for people , they are all of their actions .
every generation looks at the images that they &apos;re taking in the beginning of their conscious life as a standard and it will get all of them .
the difference is that it &apos;s a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
there can be a sequence of changes .
and at the end , they just want to get the most popular remains .
that &apos;s largely our goal .
we want to get things that are gone or things that are not like that , as they were .
you could think that the problem was that the problem was that you were in the world , and you were killing animals , and you were killing animals , and you &apos;ve been aware of a few generations , which they had done .
because obviously , an animal that was very often , once , was rarely , before it &apos;s going to be a lot of time .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of natural animals .
you lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not seen as a big loss .
we &apos;re focusing on the big animals , and in the sea , the big fish are the big fish .
they &apos;re getting less likely because we start .
and the time is a little bit of fish , and we think that &apos;s the most important thing .
the question is why people accept that .
well , because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
they will confirm it because the evidence , as they &apos;re in a previous form , are not like the evidence of the evidence .
for example , there are the anecdote that the report of a computer report , which looked at large amounts of music , can &apos;t be used , or not being used by the most natural , because he &apos;s not &quot; scientific &quot; .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous big role that can play a marine reserve .
because in marine territory , we basically put the past back .
we &apos;re going to ask the past that people can &apos;t understand because the most powerful changes , and they &apos;re very low .
so , the people who see a marine reserve and benefit from the insight that allows you to reset your own color .
what about the people who don &apos;t do that , because they don &apos;t have access to the people in the middle west for example ?
here , i think , the art and the film may be the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was a lot of time -- 500 years ago .
and the most important and the most important thing you might remember is &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were so touched by this -- except from the most violent , why were they so touched by the most violent ?
because it &apos;s something that has been lost in a way that &apos;s lost in a way .
so my only one that i &apos;m going to give you is to say , &quot; avatar ii &quot; under water , so he &apos;s going to turn &quot; avatar ii . &quot;
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist , you had to , if you had a typewriter , you had to be able to lift this in the government .
they also had to watch a sheet of a typewriter from this typewriter .
the reason for this : the government could track where a text came from .
they found a paper with a computer company , they could find the creator of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do something like this , and how much the speech would be driven .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
but if you &apos;re going to buy a new health program today in 2011 , and print a page , then this page has bright yellow yellow on every page , in a pattern that makes the site clear and the printer that makes the site clear .
that &apos;s what happens today .
and nobody seems to be a little bit of a time .
and that was an example of what our own governments are doing to the technology against us , the citizens , use .
and this is one of the three main types of oil today that we have today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening on the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three main types .
there are a lot of plastic .
for example , this is mr. &apos;s favorite , and this is mr. &apos;s favorite of ukraine in ukraine .
and the motives of the internet are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use the way they use a lot of money to make a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of the u.s. rights , the most famous , which you have made of attacks .
this is a video of the steel system in estonia .
this is alfred &apos;s .
stephen watt .
the main test .
these are matthew anderson , and so on and so on and so on .
these people are online to wealth , but they have acquired it by using a message to use money from our bank bank to claws , while we &apos;re doing our online online , or we &apos;re doing our online online , and we &apos;re going to go online to the keyboard , while we &apos;re running online .
the u.s. intelligence agency , two months ago , the swiss army army of mr. sam jain here , and on this account were secondary million dollars , as it was frozen .
mr. jain itself is on free feet , the shortcut is unknown .
and i &apos;m saying that today , it &apos;s more likely to be a victim of a nuclear war than a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be worse .
in the future , most of the crimes are going to play online .
the second largest largest , which we can see today are not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , a opinion , or through their audience .
groups like anonymous are moved over the last 12 months and have become one of the most popular on the field of the field of the field .
so these are the three main principles : criminals that do it for money , like anonymous , who are doing resistance with that , but the last group are nations , governments that lead attacks .
there are cases of the world .
it shows a great thing what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
and the netherlands is a very , very reactive from the netherlands -- or it was .
in the last fall , it had to be a trivial sign , because it was hacked .
somebody was hacked and had a lot of revelation .
and last week in a meeting with dutch , i asked one of the senior students who had the question of whether he could have been able to do it for possible , because of the most powerful people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying of such a remote noise ?
and the math is a key .
they sell the water .
what do you do with the brain ?
now , a certificate , you need to have a website with a website , with a service of the service , for example , to be lux .
now , we &apos;re all using , or many of us , and a lot of us , and they &apos;re particularly prevalent in the u.s. services , and these services are particularly prevalent in the u.s. markets like iran , where they know that they can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
but you can do it , if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign .
and hack and fake , and fake , is a fake .
and that &apos;s what happens in the case of the brain .
how about the arab spring and the things that are happening in egypt ?
now , in egypt , the easter headquarters in april 2011 , the headquarters in april of egyptian , and they found a lot of records .
in these records , a folder was called &quot; the &quot; shhh . &quot;
and in this folder , notes were in germany of a local company that had sold a few programs that they had a few programs that they were -- in very large frame -- any communication of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for utah , and they had sold this program .
the most important thing is right here .
so western governments are providing government government with a government supply that can be able to do their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , a few weeks ago , the so-called so-called the so-called the so-called a meme that was used by german , was used by german to the other citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be living in a corporate plant , you &apos;re pretty much in your phone .
but today we are far beyond that .
they tap their internet connection .
they use resources like the most cosmopolitan to get their computers to a meme that allows them to monitor their entire communication , their own , their own communication , their wildest , their wildest .
so if we think about things like this , the obvious answer of people , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a good citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i don &apos;t have anything to hide . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we now , in 2011 , our governments are trust , but every right , we &apos;re going to be able to get to that forever .
and we trust , trust , we &apos;re blind to each future government , a government that we may have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to do with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the computer .
the first one was made of the hunters , and the first idea of a simple idea : modules from cement with random measured , which fit .
and the most quickly , very quickly , became the most fast the most powerful in the world .
they put us in the position to build things bigger than we were , building bridges , a stone after the other .
essentially , the most important thing was that the building system was turned into the building .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of this .
it &apos;s called the &quot; automatically scientific stone . &quot;
and within a few years , lego went into every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for all possible .
lego has essentially the most important , the building block of the world , and it took a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the same year , the next year was announced the next revolution , the next building block .
the transistor was a little bit of a small , which was a world of static , which was a world of static , building building blocks in the world .
as the most powerful , the transistor allows us to build a lot more complex , more complex , more complex , a stone after the other .
but there &apos;s a more powerful one : the transistor was only for experts .
i personally accept that , not that the building block of our time is for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing a lot of time .
let me show you how they work .
and the electronic modules are electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re a little bit of light , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best thing about it is that they connect together with magnets .
they can &apos;t put them wrong .
the stones are the ones .
green is a copy , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is wires .
so everything you need to do is connect a blue and a green one , and you can build very quickly more quickly .
they add a blue one to a green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between and so you &apos;ve created a little bit of a little bit of a light .
take the switch out of a mountain , which is here , and you &apos;ve made a little bit of a little bit of a plastic , and you &apos;ve made a little bit of a little bit of a plastic .
add this to a more , extra effect , and they have made a more powerful effect .
i &apos;ll stop that .
and the simple play is actually a pretty powerful thing , actually .
instead of programming , you have to program , or you have to program , you have to get a little bit of a little intuitive , intuitive gestures .
so to slow down the flashing , or slow down , just turn it on this button and it &apos;s making the momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind the world is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world in a more mature stone .
lights , sound , sound , motors , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve spread up to children and see them playing with them .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how they start to understand electronics that are in the everyday world and they don &apos;t learn to learn in school .
like a computer designer , it works , or why the doors of the internet &apos;s brain , or how a ipod respond to touch .
we also brought up to the internet system .
so , for example , we had a designer with no experience in electronic things that started playing with the material as a material .
here we see , with a paper , paper and water bottles , like the street ...
a few weeks ago , we &apos;ve got to risd , and we gave them some designers that had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; do what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a more powerful computer system .
but wait , this is really my favorite story .
it &apos;s a a hummer from play-doh , fear in the darkness .
for these , the most different , a more material , a electronics was just another material .
and we want to make this material available for all of us .
so , open source source is open .
you can go to the website , download all the most , download and make it yourself .
we want the world of creators , the inventor , the contributors , because this world , where we live , are hearing these interactive world , we heard .
so , pull out and start to invent .
thank you .
