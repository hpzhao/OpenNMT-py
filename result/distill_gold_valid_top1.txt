there &apos;s something little that &apos;s going on .
it should attack the hunters of the world &apos;s hunters .
a approach would be a picture to draw a picture .
if we &apos;ve been able to get the double helix in their two strands , they see that these things like teeth look like teeth .
it &apos;s listed and the most of the time .
one is to be involved in a venture .

and if you said yes , we gave them a new one , and while they said that , we have the other thing that they built , again , again .
there was a very nice relationship between love and the number of legos .
and i think the ceo is basically not understood how important sense is .
but i should point out that the way that people could have imagined the people .
people didn &apos;t want them .
and we had two types of people .
now think about children .
and i think in the industrial revolution adam smith was real as karl marx . but we &apos;re in the knowledge industry .

now , in this environment , where you don &apos;t know whether the potential enemy is prepared to be on defense or attack whether the weapons are going to get attack , this environment is what &apos;s safe to do .
it &apos;s a huge blue area .

the arguments of the so-called id are the same old arguments that were always going to be and over again , and then they &apos;ve been going to be a while for darwin &apos;s times .
the most important natural selection is so amazing , because they &apos;re the problem to explain complexity , in form of nothing else than simplicity .
now the next one : &quot; the president of the royal society has a strong internal belief , &quot; -- -- &quot; -- that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs . &quot;
she feels in a more walkable minority , but how are the american atheists , actually , in the way , actually ?
i &apos;ve seen no numbers for the other fields of other fields like history or philosophy , but i would be amazed if you were different .
darwin was the opinion that atheism is right and good for the transport that the most people are likely to be , quote , &quot; not let . &quot;
if people like -- if atheists like stephen hawking and albert einstein uses the word &quot; god &quot; use it as a practical metaphor for this deep , magnificent part of physics we don &apos;t understand .
and the start cost about 500 dollars , in about the value of 10,000 today .
in the early days , a person had a person who was the license , you had to be in a field and it had to be made on license or property .
just because there &apos;s a certain sense of it or climbing if there are several , like wikipedia , ) a certain sentence .
i have no slides , so they &apos;re going to have to be able to be a little bit of me .
a study of the most of the time for africa has shown that there are a clear thing in 28 african countries .
the state should not be in the production of the production and services because it &apos;s inefficient and decline on this area .
but what it immediately was , the variability were dominated , which was dominated by our economic development -- that &apos;s when oil prices was high , our economy grew up very quickly .
the same thing we do in the most common .
i mean , i would have wish that you see this .
he called them , &quot; massive fatal , &quot; which means that they could kill 100 million people in the next 50 years .
until recently , we didn &apos;t need to know how a vaccine was exactly .
the main challenge for these two viruses is that they &apos;re constantly changing .
these drugs are not cure , but they &apos;re going to represent a huge triumph of science , because they &apos;re the automated death sentence of a computer at least for those who have access to them .
but you know , research has helped us have helped to do with progress for other diseases .
this was a slow machine , the process of chicken , which was dependent on chicken chicken , millions of living chicken eggs .
and the radical cost of production and the huge amount of e. of e. is to e. the same way that i &apos;ve just talked about -- look at the evidence of the time -- that would be a life .
so the challenge is full force .
the question is : why ?
do you think the african union will organize such a conference ?
there are some things that you have to know .
the speaker who was here on the stage was , i was going to be engaged in the stage , and i was going to be engaged in africa .
by steal it from your suffering people .
traditionally , africans hate governments -- they hate the insurgency .
they decide what they do .
he doesn &apos;t get help from the government , and he builds a second , bigger boat .
something that would connect us all together .
scott &apos;s results were full of it .
and the challenge for algorithmic filters , these personalized filters , is that they &apos;re going to get to this balance because they go to everything you click on .
it &apos;s supposed to be a new ideas of new ideas and new people and strangers .
and the man said , &quot; is it beautiful to go to what ? &quot;
i know you &apos;re waiting for more bad things -- i just do fun -- but now , just a quick repetition of repetition and then i &apos;ll show you new material about possible solutions .
until the most of the time , it &apos;s going to be an update on version 2.0 , where you can get directly to buy the purchase of the world .
even again , all republicans here : it shouldn &apos;t go to the way that we &apos;re going to go .
what really impressed me about the gulf of the gulf is that they &apos;re a lot of the time .
and there &apos;s actually no one trying to do any more , except a few people who try to use the beach .
we heard that bacteria eat oil ?
these are the whole ocean swimming all over the ocean .
when the japanese pearl harbor harbor , they were going back to return .
what the awkwardness of birds is , i don &apos;t want to do a fairy remarks about people who clean birds .
okay , people who call themselves less conservative when they wanted to be really conservative and really , they should send these companies to the most common .
it &apos;s about right and wrong .
and i developed a system to produce medical dating .
okay , &quot; i &apos;m more than my genes &quot; -- all together .
i didn &apos;t asked you to get it to the most important because it &apos;s true , but to remember you .
they contain a molecule that we know as a brain system .
and that &apos;s just a little bit of a sudden . it &apos;s a lot smaller than a human being .
now , neurons like trees , can grow new branches and lose old branches .
and we can even talk about the most of the time .
if you celebrate this number , you can easily get a little bit of potential that there &apos;s a big potential for the brain .
maybe this technology will be able to meet that we &apos;re able to meet ourselves through increasing and put our own brain .
he &apos;s working on music music and ads with his company , the most of the time .
so we &apos;ve prepared a quick experiment here to show you that .
ks : no , not yet .
while he did that , he noticed a unexpected thing .
ks : so how does this work : there &apos;s a matrix of the
ridiculous , right ?
and a few months ago , a friend sent me a link to this guy , eduardo sousa .
a huge offer for a few weeks .
but he still did .
so his farm is incredible .
because he found these wild plant , which is the most important plant .
and then they fly in the circle .
i finally came to try to try and try before i went .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
what about hell that &apos;s called the hell ?
at least . i think it &apos;s going .
farmers who leave themselves on nature to find solutions , rather than nature , are more important .
and from the old fire to change the new fire , two big stories about oil and electricity that both the two fifth of the fossil are in the air .
our fuel for mobility is three fifth to cars .
you can let it be quiet , it &apos;s harder than titan .
trucks and planes can use realistic hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
also , better light and the most important thing , and so forth , the egyptians are going to reduce a third .
in about 20 , private energy has been a cheap solar system without financial losses on their roofs and reduce their own .
and what we &apos;re doing is that it &apos;s going to be about the same cost : about six trillion dollars in net net -- although we buy more of what we have or new nuclear power .
so , on the results , and not incentives , to focus on , can lead to the world &apos;s and conflict of the energy system .
later , i realized that what i had eaten was two of his family &apos;s family .
these simple things that are going to show you that donor areas are going to go to school , where the least kids go to school , and this is new questions .
two years ago , at the eight 15th 2010 , i called my father .
i &apos;m not trying to design the toothbrush .
we remember and can look at this in every book of my favorite son , that life was taken four billion years ago -- four billion dot ?
so , i &apos;m not quite sure .
there are dangers , there are dangers . a trap : the vertical .
you have time thinking , you have time to do what to do about art and things like that .
you go back to the future , back , back , back , back , go back .
they all come from families , which is usually one person at home , mostly the mother or grandmother , and they come here for their education and their structure .
we &apos;re bringing them to the right and the left to turn , so they can tell you the consequences when you &apos;re going to get orders .
let &apos;s go online . &quot;
it &apos;s predictions .
they said , &quot; that &apos;s enough for the time .
then you can support us . that &apos;s the task of you . &quot;
but i have to have my favorite job .
you can listen and join .
for example , let &apos;s take the most of the time .
if you think about the concept of wikipedia , everybody at the content has been working on the content , and you have the largest encyclopedia of the world .
there are many people who have the same dream .
a website was created .
there was no leader .
extremism has become tolerance .
the modern tools of neuroscience show us that what happens there is an incredibly complex process .
we can keep cool of our own language , but not the stranger .
we were checking that by the american babies who never heard a second language , at the beginning of the critical phase .
it may look like a little bit of a sudden of mars .
science on one side has a very rational approach to their environment , while art is usually an emotional approach to its environment .
now i have a common one over here to show you that .
let me demonstrate this over here .
the dalai lama once said , &quot; love and compassion are a lot of the time .
the starrs were raised by a small girl whose body was burned .
it &apos;s part of every human being .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we choose with compassion ?
the wound is the maggots .
suppose you like squares , and honestly , who doesn &apos;t like it ?
we start with a computer and then we &apos;re going to get more and more .
then there was art &apos;s research , a computer system .
i : &quot; he &apos;s dead .
&quot; i have what the computer program ! &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t get a constructive . what happens ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what do you do here ? &quot;
so i went to the lobby and saw this indian guy .
marco tempest : if you asked him to deception , he said , &quot; a series of magic : magic is the only one .
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to demonstrate you how deeply terrorism is connected to our daily lives .
at the time i interviewed the red brigades , i discovered that their life was not about ideology and politics , but from economic constraints .
i think many people even thought of me for a little bit more .
but especially they went to serious , and they were organized in serious the crime .
this money was in the most of the time , and the most of the time -- in bar , understanding .
nobody wants to control the most recent and to provide its own and to deal with customers .
some of you may think , &quot; wait for a minute . you don &apos;t necessarily see how a computer &apos;s .
yeah , i wanted to leave my favorite , but what i didn &apos;t see was that it &apos;s extremely uncomfortable , to leave his favorite .
and i really learned that , the bigger the challenge , the bigger the feeling of a special performance , if you get to the end .
well , i thought , the atlantic was big , but the pacific is really big .
but that wasn &apos;t without any of the time .
it &apos;s this little green disk on the horizon , which is very nervous because of the rising sea level .
we can start to make better , more sustainable decisions .
and the tahltan of the pacific , why i &apos;m going to be talking about the pacific
this is the world trade on the cover .
why ? why ? why do you want to do that ?
he doesn &apos;t see a surplus cost . he doesn &apos;t use a extra time .
they were able to make that .
and then the last thing is about comfort , it &apos;s about comfort , that they feel good at places that they didn &apos;t feel good before .
and that &apos;s hard when you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i asked myself , how can it be so easy to give my dreams to give my dreams ?
it &apos;s not so hard to do someone , and one day before school , i said , &quot; yeah , you can overcome my homework , &quot; and i gave him the wrong answers to the night .
we both were put on the back of the class in the class , so we wouldn &apos;t be threatened with the most of the time .
maybe you brought your own and brought your teeth , but never told you , because how can you claim yourself if all of you want to go around you ?
this is french science .
well , then go .
if you look at these trucks here , it &apos;s the largest trucks of his kind of way on earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the largest and the fastest growing of co2 in canada , and it &apos;s also why canada is now the number three is in terms of a head .
and as a father , i can &apos;t imagine what that is a soul .
by doing that , we remove a big part of our biggest part of our biggest and replace them with most greenhouse gases of the future .
the most of your work is the close , you can buy the average in every store and the millions of indian women every day on your forehead . it &apos;s about a ritual that &apos;s deeply related to the institution of marriage .
and the shaw was born in the americas , in the stairwell , raised and trained in london .
i hope you can convince you that complex and complicated is not always the same .
the most of the time is the one that we want to affect -- the public support for the government .
so i proposed in my first tedtalk that we should spend 21 billion hours a week with video games .
only 30 minutes a day of a day , a lot of improvement for a significant improvement of the mood and the difference of joy .
why a game ?
how could a game game be like this kind of game in so serious , sometimes situations ?
there are four types of strength , or resilience to starve growth , and there are scientifically spacecraft things that you can do every day to build these resilience .
it &apos;s going to be more practice .
here &apos;s another secret for you : if you shake somebody &apos;s hand for six seconds , the most of the time you get to your blood , the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot;
and in this project , we actually have hundreds of people around the world , and they &apos;re doing that with us . actually , thousands of people are involved in this project .
and then a few people came from chicago and said , &quot; end 2007 is the slogan of chicago festival , the global warming . we have a square square gallery and we want you to fill them with your reef . &quot;
wool and the most of the people are not just two concepts that fit good .
hanna asked , &quot; how can i define parallel lines ? &quot;
infinitely . she was staying . right .
so we have , from wool , skills , which is proof of the most famous , the most famous of mathematics is wrong .
and their individual ideas , and their engagement with this mathematical method .
this particular property trait -- that &apos;s my opinion -- is my opinion of neuroscience , who &apos;s neuroscience . and eventually we &apos;ll understand what &apos;s going on .
this person is otherwise at a very disturbing mind and intelligent . but if he sees his mother , his delusion is not going to be his delusion and he says it &apos;s not his mother .
so if this area is damaged , they lose the ability to see faces .
tables and chairs and the other -- nothing happens , just like normal people . if i &apos;m going to show him a picture of his mother , the most common activity is low .
he knows that his arm is not there . nonetheless , it &apos;s a brilliant , a experience of experience .
maybe you can do that with the most of the time that the champagne in the phantom is solving .
and my pain are gone . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , the last three days i didn &apos;t have phantom and therefore no more , no more , no , no , no , no , no , no , i have gone .
and the blue is blue , oink is green , another sound could be yellow .
that &apos;s the key .
which is kiki , which is a minimal ?
you &apos;re to be able to get a lot of the most of us to deal with .
that &apos;s kanzi .
none of the things you &apos;re going to see in this video is the most powerful .
well , good .
he learned that he &apos;s going to be able to use both hands , with his conventional favorite , much larger and more , and they can make a lot of the time .
a bunch of reference means a hut in the forest .
does he look where the sound comes ?
because we believe that it &apos;s not the biology , but the culture .
and some stars die in spectacular explosions that leave these remains .
on the right , there &apos;s gravity . einstein explains that .
and it &apos;s going to be made of the new species of change .
it was still too early for this , but he was a moral building , an inspiration for scientists who were worried about control .
let &apos;s take aliens creatures , we &apos;ve seen our favorite point of the same outside outside in the cosmos and not only for 40 years , but the whole four billion years of the world &apos;s population .
martin hirshberg : is this our last century ?
and it &apos;s going to be worse : &quot; then i would make a picture of it and make a dozen of them .
now , these are students , so they gave a lot of money for things like the valleys and makeup .
and then we asked them to be happy .
but enormous different incentives .
these are the most important in belgium .
the teams , which we gave money to spend it , were actually to other teams and the humanities at the end of the end .
if we hear about the most of the time , from the high , the high of the high , we often believe that this is one of these most of the things that are in the middle east , which is the roots of the way .
ironically , that was a time to be the most of iran &apos;s peace with washington , and not the destruction of israel .
this is an analogy that &apos;s going to be able to do that , diplomacy is inevitable . is the diplomacy inevitable .
you can look for certain of the most difficult or you can look at the different regions and compare them .
the map of port jumps on the end of 2009 was not so good as they could have , not as good as the map of california .
the trick of this .
and she said , &quot; he was not an aerial . &quot;
this system wants to keep the status quo , also the status quo of a government .
so it &apos;s not that my theme is the most important thing . that &apos;s not .
we can &apos;t do anything . &quot;
lawrence lessig : we , the citizens , have to go back to the republic .
for example , some people are going to be in this room , but it was sputnik with a scholarship to school .
that &apos;s what &apos;s about my pen . &quot;
everybody is just a little bit of a little bit more .
i don &apos;t want to say that the law of entropy doesn &apos;t true , it &apos;s true .
here &apos;s the model of the attack of the design .
if you see fireflies in north america , the way that many things are active in the united states , they &apos;re ignore each other .
each of their favorite systems depends on this critical region , the most of the time , the more than 10,000 independent cells , which is a silver rhythm -- a high tension , a low tension .
they were a while in the way , but they were apart apart .
so i want to show you a few interviews with people who were opening up to the bridge and describe what happened .
now , you &apos;re usually not holding a metronome , but we &apos;re all running -- we &apos;re going to run and go back to the walk .
im : that &apos;s just a few tons , so it &apos;s pretty fast .
but the scientists in his area .
i didn &apos;t say what the list was , but she was in the order of order , and i told you , you should look for your name , your favorite , or the &apos; 70s of your mother .
and also , maybe this fee has a one-hour or maybe a more powerful , which is not worth economically , a resilience against disease or pearl or a different property that &apos;s useful for climate change , and the other thing .
we &apos;re going to see children in television .
the idea with svalbard was that it &apos;s cold , so you have natural temperatures under freezing .
and if anything happens , you can come and pick it up .
thank you .
look at your body &apos;s body ! this is not right .
maybe some lady , a lady ? thank you .
you just tried two concepts -- two in the united states , and one of the russians .
madness ! i have to talk about innovation -- the things are developing , there &apos;s a lot of activity , and then they &apos;re replaced by something else and die .
i can &apos;t tell you when it goes , because i don &apos;t want the competition to know my refrigerator .
i mean something really interesting that &apos;s going to happen here .
ok , let &apos;s talk a little bit about the commercial development of the pharmacy space .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a few years , he &apos;s ready to give up , but one day he has a epiphany .
institutions are going to be naked , and if you &apos;re naked , well , the consequences has been .
the fourth meaning of openness and the fourth principle is a lot of the time .
the granny is from the most of the time .
you know that bees and fish live in school .
all over us , a medical revolution is a revolution that will help us defeat some of the worst diseases of our society , including cancer with including them .
this is a tumor , dark , gray , a banana mass , a brain .
and you can see that the ring of the blood supply is going to be away after treatment .
but the real question is : how good work do these in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add a little bit of a sudden . it prevents angiogenesis very effective .
but more interesting , from the study , the men who have developed the most more tomato sauce , the ones that have more tomato sauce , they had less blood vessels that have feed their cancer .
albert von once said that &quot; discoveries is to see what all of you have seen , and think about what nobody thought has thought . &quot;
i &apos;m a discovering magazine in discover magazine .
it has to make fun , unlike everyday problems , which is frankly not a very good puzzle .
this is the background of the other .
you can &apos;t do that , but you can &apos;t do that , but it &apos;s going to be a computer . over the computer .
i wanted to make a sequel .
what direction are that going to fall ?
so there are games like &quot; brain republican &quot; for the nintendo dave , a computer system .
looks like a black character . where is that ?
i really believe that a girl is to be so powerful that we had to train all of the time .
i remember my father , who was very , very violent , proposed to me .
we &apos;re used to steal girls &apos;s following , to be able to be a difference of their own life that we actually made them objects and they &apos;ve been turned into them .
and she looked at the eyes of her babies and said , &quot; of course , i love my baby . how could i love my baby ?
when we were there , she did a ritual where they were girls who are the elected , with their families .
and i &apos;m going to be on your own life for the rest of your life . &quot;
i love that i don &apos;t take things easy .
why should you want me to do that , you know , the way i want you to do it ?
so , in the actual process , all six teenagers said , and the most six year-old , the most six they had done by the photo photo .
but the incident was in the middle of january , on the northern hemisphere , to the northern hemisphere .
this is 10 feet away .
and what does this example show -- what about that is important to keep us memory ?
he was a very religious man .
i got a year and traveled a year through africa , where i asked people why they built fractals , which is a great job when you can get it .
and that &apos;s where some villages go to the smallest level .
it &apos;s not really mathematical knowledge .
he said , &quot; if i lived in the jungle , i would just use a long time to use it , because it &apos;s very fast and it &apos;s very cheap .
and odd and odd makes .
we have a little bit of a sudden .
but the bad news is .
instead of turning friends or relatives , they looked at david &apos;s workplace .
today , agile development is applied to a hundred countries , and it &apos;s enough to go up to the most .
fear of the prayer is losing the following .
we &apos;re going to ask a few rules and hold them .
the conversation will walk better . &quot;
just as i was going to go to the evening tonight to come here , one of my daughters started to get a friend of mine .
and we developed 10 statements .
i was a teenager when i first read &quot; anna &quot; and the famous first sentence : &quot; all happy families , same families , same .
i want to show you how to look at something invisible .
if i come to the water , you see a silver and this is the most powerful thing that &apos;s the water of the water system . it stays dry .
and plato with all the young boys in his cave . sweeney : a little bit of ...
i &apos;m going to show you .
but tesla &apos;s success wasn &apos;t from the duration .
one thing i want to do is that not all the neurosurgeon are wearing all the neurosurgeon .
we can be able to turn them up or turn , right or make it turn .
he &apos;s one of five children .
i showed you that we can apply it into the circuits of the mood in the mood of depression .
we &apos;re to understand what these circuits are and what the brain &apos;s brain are responsible for the clinical signs and symptoms of the disease .
evolution works in reality as a journalist as an engineer .
that &apos;s enough !
what we &apos;ve discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human being , or a cockroach or a crab or a a juggler that &apos;s the relative of the feather .
okay . the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , right ? it &apos;s incredible , students tried and they couldn &apos;t say it .
he makes this with a kind of glue glue .
what we do is we take the hair as a model , and imagine with another colleagues from berkeley .
showed that from the research of the research , two thirds of the child &apos;s population , two thirds of the child , but only one third of the child &apos;s women have been .
at monday , i left san francisco , my favorite , and flew to this conference .
and we go out at the end , look at us and say , &quot; how did it go ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous study of harvard business school about a woman named heidi .
and i have my hand back again and i fell in all other women and then you have more questions , just by men . &quot;
a woman was telling me about this and i looked at it -- she saw something young .
thank you .
they don &apos;t do it so on , as they should , but they do it .
so not fear was the defining factor .
but it &apos;s the middle of the black .
i want to talk about this now , thinking about how we spread in this country , how we get to the information .
so they &apos;re in clean , more important language , and that works .
we tell you that everything is okay ; that it &apos;s good .
this patient is about 50 , we can say pretty much , like big , to get cancer .
they don &apos;t need the level of the audience in this room .
and this bee certainly had accepted , &quot; i get to this , i &apos;m going to get this flower , this flower , i get the nectar and then i go off . &quot;
and if you talk about nature , that &apos;s a writer , is the idea of the world &apos;s idea , how is the idea of the world &apos;s idea ?
well , we &apos;re all equally sophisticated .
the only technology here is the cheap of the cheap , pretty new , to a car car , even i could be infected with a copy of 10 ar in 15 minutes .
if a computer &apos;s favorite , the grass is going to be on this blade of blade , and it &apos;s immediately interesting .
and now i say that i want to build a layer of games on the world , but that &apos;s not quite true , because it &apos;s already in development ; it &apos;s happening .
if not , the shame is . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
come on to a certain time , you get your drinks to half the price .
and then you can really reach good kinds of things .
and it &apos;s powerful .
and the most important dynamic is a more successful dynamic , which is trying to find the best news , which is most exciting stories .
we &apos;ve talked to you last time ago .
you also see , if i turn that around -- hopefully i don &apos;t get the world too much .
you can see , here it started .
this is one of our engineers .
and the traumatic student , who should have been teaching students , discovered the law of the extended , just as a hobby .
raise your hands .
it makes it a place where it makes fun to work .
and so that &apos;s what we &apos;re working on , and we even have people who are excited about it and crazy enough that they &apos;re working on it .
thank you .
what brunel , how he said , was going to be able to reach for his passengers , was the experience of the landscape .
what does life do easier , more comfortable ?
part of the part of the world &apos;s , they &apos;re using this by building a great new facility , using the basement of one of their hospitals .
today , the industrial systems have been the same as the time of time , and they have become part of the present problem .
and as brunel can we , by the way , we can have a bigger effect of systems .
from my coach , the waiter was surprised with his boss .
mark &apos;s and i have tried to answer a series of studies , just to answer this question .
yet , it &apos;s exactly what the american paradigm requires .
but for the 2,000 of the 2,000 , the christmas availability was the christmas availability on the market like a computer .
the americans themselves discover that unlimited choice seem more attractive than in practice .
and the parents would say , &quot; noah was just for so short time , but he taught us so much .
robert frost once said , &quot; it &apos;s poetry who &apos;s lost in translation . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant thing of pink . &quot;
the three problems have one together : they &apos;re more powerful problems that are controlled by forces .
so thank you .
it &apos;s supposed to replace competition through collaboration .
and then we build a little bit of a time , which we can test the maximum performance of machines , and so we can be very , very quickly .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that the most best thing is not a result of the best as a computer system , but as a movement movement .
the nuclear weapon enters the stage .
and then the 92 nuclear nuclear , which would provide the energy , the rest of los angeles .
then you take it and stick it on the screen of your television , and you &apos;re going to get it out of the inside , right .
if you replace the word blogosphere or the internet today , it &apos;s very precisely that its notion is now very compelling . let &apos;s hear it in .
i think it was this exchange that led to computer computers .
ph : i hope you understand how to do that .
ultimately , the race is won to get momentum , when the phone phone is the phone .
mm : because there &apos;s a role of the audience , something to do .
they produce things for 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute .
and where television has been what &apos;s going on , what &apos;s going to be built is a very exciting new way of communication , and we have the collaboration of two industries and a new way of thinking about it .
this is a spanish architect and designers .
color can occur simple blocks , simple materials : if i go through new york , i think .
it gave me suggestions -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco and we all talk to us and build a few installations .
the use of the city for public space has been placed in the day , is more powerful , almost an international model .
even the pieces of the airplane had french .
he said , &quot; well , first of all , there &apos;s more girls there . &quot;
and that was , finally , as i , after some of the things i was , after some of the most of the things i ended up with .
he said she had one of the new , better chairs .
or they &apos;re going to pull them up into the position .
but i knew , i knew , and when i go around the offices , where there was a lot of the time , there was no one on the idea of getting a lot of the idea , and to adapt to it .
and fever has spread in the way .
two days ago , or yesterday , i can &apos;t remember exactly that , i read in a little bit of a sudden that the first one has been released , about 52 euros of view .
we need something that was really a really , really , really , so he didn &apos;t spread the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : males hits females , every amount of offspring .
so , the biggest problem is not our biggest problem .
&quot; why now ? &quot; &quot; why here ? &quot;
and most of the time i hardly remove myself , although i &apos;m a little bit of a sudden .
look at the data .
now , our mobile phones can now engineer a story of our most of our lives .
bill &apos;s : your health depends on where you live .
this is my grandfather .
from the simple reason , nobody else talks about it .
as at the beginning , plants are explaining phosphorus through water from the ground .
here &apos;s a remarkable article from a remarkable article from a human being , &quot; nature , &quot; which is the discussion about the phosphorus crisis .
80 percent of it is going to be lost .
and instead of a dose of 100 percent , we take one of 25 percent .
we have a working technology and one that &apos;s going to be able to do some of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the things that we &apos;re going to do on the world .
and he was a so-called called a so-called a so-called , he looked all the time and mutations to find rules and laws , instead of looking at the norms .
and in this example , you see that the individual stages repeat , but they repeat , without being a more , very much .
as an architect , i just think about relationships between the pieces and all over the time , but in terms of a computer problem , it &apos;s always going to be a matter of business .
we gave ourselves to the level of the building , where we could build the five separate towers , but they should all be on the 60 floor .
come back back , a few years later , in 2003 , and we &apos;ll see that this landscape looks honest than rainforest .
the difference is especially in the desert in the desert , or maybe the most of the time in the desert , whatever they want .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that were illegal , and now on the air .
we doubled the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world , just by fertilizers that cause huge problems in water quality ; rivers , lakes and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the most important thing for the most important thing for the most important thing .
but we can do that and there are opportunities .
irrigation is the biggest largest thing on the most of the time .
work together .
so -- what is the creation of production system ?
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
the whole business system is not paying taxes .
we interact with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biological planetary to amplify these kinds of things -- muscles .
this is what it looks like .
here we are , or cut the nerve , from small parts of the world &apos;s and they were doing other people &apos;s being programmed to us -- signal . two other , the ones that we have our hand -- signal .
ak : it works good .
but i can &apos;t put an electrode and say , &quot; there &apos;s . &quot;
and that &apos;s our goal -- something clinically clinically to wear .
that &apos;s jesse and he &apos;s going to press a computer .
so thank you .
sub-saharan africa is largely , because there &apos;s 22 million people living with hiv , which are very 70 percent of the 30 million people who are infected around the world .
governments have to create effective to the ethical aspects of ethical aspects in clinical trials , which are approved in the different developing world .
the fundamental problems that we &apos;re faced with is to be high consumption and too many people .
so they all meet criteria that are usually like people .
so you see this electricity that goes north -- the most the time in this case -- the way to the galapagos , and this is the most important thing that comes up with the galapagos .
we also know that not only threatened by being threatened , but as penguins and other people .
now i want to show you that penguins are going to be moved in the .
turbo has discussed , with his own goodbye to the door , we &apos;re going to keep it in and he comes in here .
and then there &apos;s another one that comes very comfortable .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we don &apos;t have solved : our basic political geography .
the two parts of a long time .
again , as in the case of mongolia , china doesn &apos;t stimulate russia . it &apos;s it .
for the world , china reduces its own , so that the most important thing that they can sell is the most cheaper and cambodia , and they &apos;re going to depend on china .
what i want to introduce you to here , i call a day , day .
these two arrows form a bow , a bow of the world &apos;s and other infrastructure , which connects the west bank with gaza .
a lot of them .
so what &apos;s next ? how does the future look like the european union ?
53 countries and far most of the suspects are straight lines on the map .
this dream exists in its salt .
it &apos;s bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
okay .
and the hormone receptor is causing the growth .
so how can a hormone finally be the speed of aging ?
we think that insulin and ties are hormones , which are particularly active in the circumstances of the circumstances -- in good times -- if food is going to be there , and not much stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details about how it works , but we know foxo genes have an impact on life expectancy .
basically , you could change the genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process i &apos;ve talked about is what &apos;s going on in the worm , a different normal of how to be a bird , like a bird , so that the bird can live much longer .
they &apos;re never going to see one such ad , because nike wants to buy that they buy their shoes .
they all show heroes that were the most important .
it &apos;s like trying to walk against a computer .
this view is that many of the most people are doing the way prozac in essence of the brain is essentially changing the chemistry of the brain as if the brain was in fact of the container soup .
and my favorite colleague seymour believes that it &apos;s also .
we found that a mutant , a lot of longer needed to get to the most of the time , and when we were the genes that were played in this mutation , we could discover a more powerful .
this question has been asked for a long time for people , but we can actually test it .
so , or so , mosquitos find us in the dark by putting us out . they smell us .
just with it , it &apos;s the cheese .
people actually told me that they &apos;re going to be tied to mosquitos .
in the most difficult way .
and every time i felt the embarrassment of the eyes of the eyes behind me .
and as a result , fat is one of the best sources for adults stem cells .
while we talk , about the 47 clinical trials , the use of stem cells for the use of stem cells .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angels in the world . not just in our country : venezuela . in our entire world .
so what happens when what happens ?
but here you see what &apos;s really going on .
i can &apos;t tell you anything about it because i stopped the headline .
and the characteristic of the senior singer : what you don &apos;t know about marriage
but how ?
it &apos;s even better . it seems to be that we can make this receiver with the brain , that in the dna is being repeated .
the animal jumps , it &apos;s spreading its wings , it &apos;s economically , but it can &apos;t really go , because the fly is caught between two glass .
for a intelligent creature like our fly , this rule is not going to be able to make it in stone , but it &apos;s changing while the animal learns through experience .
and we were able to be able to see the identity of the critic to 12 cells .
there &apos;s a few ideas in the most of the time , and the artificial intelligence , as you could do that , but we still haven &apos;t solved one example of how intelligent behavior is from the physical interaction .
here &apos;s a guy , or actually a kind of a guy &apos;s favorite .
ed : go yeah . tb : okay . a little bit more to the middle , a little bit more to the middle .
i know that hospitals can be a very dangerous place for young people .
here &apos;s a picture of my favorite of legacy .
i &apos;m telling you , this kind of design model , which involves everything , from your goals to your genes , will be the most important transformation that we &apos;re going to see in health care .
they don &apos;t stick like velcro , or glue .
here we have the robot .
marc &apos;s building the most recent thing built .
what would happen if you put on the bottom of the paper , and it &apos;s going to come a little bit of a sudden or we would shake the sheet ? &quot;
and so , on the end , they &apos;ve done it . and he does this .
of course , completely different than you see that in a computer system .
we &apos;re going to look at the rising sea level .
and i would say , people work in the ocean and think about the goals , we should be a lot of lower .
that &apos;s the ship i was the last three months in antarctica .
if this ice goes up , the sea level goes up to six feet .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news for the ceiling are the galapagos islands .
you have the water water .
but then at the end , you see the most important thing in black .
we have very interesting opportunities to have the co2 co2 in the atmosphere million of the years , but we &apos;ve just made that in the case of 20 million years .
and this is the task that einstein has asked to figure out how gravity works .
einstein has already had space and time , biases and curves to describe gravity .
but deep in the structure of space , the idea of the idea could be more dimensions than we see there .
and as the strings of a cello , the strings of a cello can also occur in different patterns .
not .
is this just an interesting mathematical construction that might be able to explain some of the most powerful properties of the world , or can we actually show these extra dimensions ?
so we have two plates here with colorful points .
now , can the predator see what &apos;s going on , you attack it ?
and what &apos;s true for sensory information is generally true for all information .
and we look at about 30 seconds , which is quite a hammer in a 18 minutes long talk .
why ? because if the ones are actually in this shadow , it would be the same amount of light on your eye , and reflect the same amount of light on your eye .
how do you know that ?
and she comes into the beehive , and it &apos;s going to find a blank and family -- and that &apos;s honey .
he finds him . madness , or ?
voices do you ? yes ?
often there &apos;s no right or wrong .
in 2010 , in new york , not so much .
we &apos;re also a species of the storyteller .
now some things : understanding of security , the risks , the dangers , the electromagnetic , how they work .
but in a modern and complex world , they need models to understand the many risks that we &apos;re faced with .
think about cancer , bird flu , flu flu , sars .
there was no new insights , but less fear .
and there &apos;s another cognitive bias : i call it a little bit of the data by choosing data that disagree with our own and the data that disagree with our own .
i &apos;m familiar with another group , to pick up whether my airplane was safe to fly .
this is the people .
and he was found near the near , stanford .
they had good recent with their teachers , students .
let me ask you some questions to figure out whether that &apos;s a good choice . &quot;
i took a lot of people put on it , and they &apos;re going to save them or save them , where i could give myself a volunteer hand , but i found that nobody did something .
we opened the first section of 2009 .
robert : a park in the sky
and groups were called very often &quot; terrorists . &quot;
they need a process of the process that can deal with the core of these very complicated society with its problems .
it &apos;s about seeing a revolution in the arab world , a revolution of the ground , a computer system .
paradox of that is that the last decade was so promising , and that &apos;s a main reason .
on once , the ngos call their wounded not only on the streets -- but they took them into negotiations , part of the way they &apos;re the victims of these weapons .
thank you very much for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think that &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot;
so this was completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little crazy to work on a new computer .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this strange rich man in the movie ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the last day comes out , the sun comes out , and they come directly to the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i &apos;m going to give you a little nervous here , because i &apos;m going to tell you a few radical things about how we should think about cancer to a audience that contains a lot more than i do .
the part of the genome we can read is the list of the ingredients .
it &apos;s a huge amount of information in genetics by just comparing the genetic similarity .
and i , &quot; okay . at least that guy is good connected . &quot;
so we basically measure every single amount of energy as a own .
if you have malaria , we give them a little bit of the time , or some of the things that are .
where we really need to get , is the process that &apos;s just going to be the process , and that &apos;s the level of the brain activities on the level of why the body doesn &apos;t even make it possible ? &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; ? &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; ? &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; ? &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; ? &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; ? &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; ? &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos; &apos;
danny hillis : understanding cancer through proteomics
they all are members in tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to give people to give these people .
because on stage three are most of us .
this is their lobby .
there was no plan . never before anybody tried something like this .
in fact , martin luther kings was in stage three .
so i &apos;m sitting here in this chair and do nothing . &quot;
and suddenly they got the most important and tried to figure out , &quot; how do we ask the population of sub-saharan africa ? &quot;
automatically , we &apos;re going to be the little piece of plastic up .
this is the way that they were doing this or a weekly , designed to go to the ground , to go to the ground , to the ground , on the ground , they were not as a permanent building .
they &apos;re going to be the stability and security , which can offer the lap of a uncle , you compare them to the battlefield of a juvenile niece in high school .
but from my perspective , compassion has a problem .
and it &apos;s the most important form of the brain &apos;s gratification .
i can &apos;t really explain them , and he doesn &apos;t .
stories like this , sign like this , are practical aid in a world that &apos;s going to be shown with compassion , the odds of suffering , which could otherwise be pleased to us .
gandhi was also a really powerful person .
and the first day , our favorite day was going to go to us and taught us our motto , which we had to do every day for the rest of the summer to make the describe .
this is one of two or three of their known known known .
here are some examples .
it turns out we can &apos;t be part of a group without expanding the opinion of the other .
so that &apos;s the world that we live in today .
and so i &apos;m trying to learn from the example of my grandfather &apos;s example .
okay , number two : go into the wild .
and imagine that , they make a inner picture : i was born in a very small village in mexico , unfortunately , very much , very much , and my parents had no higher education .
and so we think that through all the changes that are happening , we &apos;re going to meet incredible opportunities today .
it &apos;s a initiative that &apos;s on simple , and it &apos;s going to be gone , and it &apos;s going to be solutions .
we &apos;ve sent 30 different technologists now in 18 different countries , and we were able to connect millions of people in terms of learning what this particular segment needs and requires .
and on my favorite , my father came to me and said , &quot; you know , i remember you can do it better than the previous .
i know many people who are very smart and yet say , &quot; why can &apos;t i solve my problem ? &quot;
i started with another family in 1980 .
don &apos;t you believe that we have the responsibility to take the environment seriously ? &quot;
i still drive the same four years old ford like before .
but that &apos;s not a good life .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s praying .
whether you believe them or not , no difference for me now .
so he said , &quot; what do you think you &apos;re going to do ? &quot;
what &apos;s that in your hand ? &quot; -- i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball , and this basketball represents your identity , which you are .
when my children were small , i went to her room , sat on her bed and looked at my children at sleep .
it &apos;s less than i had a lot of time -- i &apos;m going to be able to be able to be 10 to 10 million -- but yet it &apos;s a very significant number .
in a village , we have 100 laptops , every one with a different collection of 100 books , so that the village suddenly has 10 books .
right , the famous chinese characters for the time .
they answer the question : how does it feel like you &apos;re going to be able to check mistakes ?
we really learn these really bad lesson .
think about how it is to feel in the right .
and unlike all other animals , we &apos;re obsessed with it , trying to figure out .
and i have to tell you that i thought i was writing this incredibly transcendent book about a subject that all hate , for a audience that would never be .
the effect of it is not just a wheat of wheat , but mountains of grain .
1986 , she came from vietnam to america .
the answer was , &quot; that &apos;s even worse . &quot;
our favorite system sank on a third of the average in our industry , and in the five years of the pest , our favorite system has tripled .
and bhutan , for the ones that don &apos;t know , is the youngest democracy of the world , only two years old .
it &apos;s actually that we &apos;re often traveling to happiness as if happiness is something we have to capture , a thing , or maybe several things we need to get .
and we ask 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s the simplicity .
what we need to learn as leaders is that we can affect the production of production by creating the right conditions that we can live with .
bl : okay . one , two , three .
under deck , you tell you the inner inner , you move your own . but your eyes are moving into the boat , and say , &quot; i &apos;m silent . &quot;
amy , come up ?
the method : what did you do ? the result : what have you seen ?
i just read one .
real scientific education should give people a voice and they enjoy them , and so that &apos;s why amy is the last word in this short story .
poor people don &apos;t have this opportunity to do choice .
we were inside the &apos; 70s .
and to come there , we have to see that the principle of a computer is not just allowed to be the species that we &apos;ve talked about , but our society is also touching .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure somebody &apos;s already asked , &quot; yes , great things up there -- but how do i come up there ?
i was a professor at the time davis , and i got a lot of attention to this . that allowed me to fund the program of the program .
we have eight motors in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart , they fall apart and they end up here .
i mean , people ask themselves whether mobile phones are safe .
you have a questionnaire .
because , remember the original idea of dr. , the most of his wife &apos;s mobile phone .
and for those who can &apos;t read it , it &apos;s like , &quot; it seems like it &apos;s actually a kind of wireless technology . &quot;
green or natural , natural or natural , where it &apos;s not going to be a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the existing debt of the fish in our bodies .
first , a more , a little bit of a , continuous with the most of death , the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; death death . &quot;
only months later , i learned who he really was .
i &apos;m looking for a cure .
i say , &quot; hold it on life when you can . &quot;
even with this kind of thing , in our hands , we have the hope to make hope again .
but a feature .
suddenly he knows that he was defeated .
to allow you to do this , we have to put them back on the driver &apos;s driver .
we &apos;re going to be the area , we &apos;re going to be able to send people into , we sent people to the buildings , we helped the buildings . we helped the first more .
if i do this , i don &apos;t lose the original details . the opposite , i could write a story here .
you &apos;re going to be the public opinion of the public opinion .
that &apos;s not very good .
and what one democracy is .
here &apos;s the question : what country is going to cut better , china or india ?
because the indian man has a advantage of two years to the indian woman .
what political change is , they introduced them to the .
china , so i think , has still a few of the great things , and the basics of the so-called social capital -- especially in terms of social capital , public health care , a sense of equality that doesn &apos;t exist in india .
it was a place where people with the super , with the final heritage and with different kinds of things , and they &apos;re going to be able to be .
and now they have the problem that they spent the whole money to afford help with this advanced electronics in these countries and now everything .
a little chaotic environment , where probably many ideas came , where people were more likely to have new , interesting , more interesting , people different .
about a , or two decades ago , a wonderful thing was a wonderful thing about the name howard , and read darwin &apos;s notebook from this period .
they &apos;re going to be in their colleagues , but everybody said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think i thought it &apos;s going to be done .
does that go to the other ?
in the 1970s , the &quot; one percent &quot; was made 10 percent of the national income in the united states .
many of these political factors can be roughly roughly in the category of crony capitalism , political change , political change , which help a group of good with each other .
as you can see , as globalization and technological revolution , this global rule of money is creating it much harder to grade all the time .
so they invest unprecedented amounts of time and tools to train their children .
we created the modern of the modern .
this is his little hand .
we &apos;re all going to die .
that was a huge disappointment for us , because we believed a new development .
i even believe that places like oregon , where you can take medical laden into the world , and can eat a toxic dose , just half a percent of people ever did .
so , long talk short , they came to canada .
but i also heard about cancer as most of the time of our time , so how adapted the good and the bad thing ?
some articles went to say that skeletal muscle is resistant to cancer , and beyond , not just against cancer , but it &apos;s not just that metastases are spreading in skeletal muscle .
16 percent ! that &apos;s where these are these things that were these little tumors in skeletal muscle , but only 16 percent of the actual metastases -- what &apos;s going to be able to control angiogenesis , the tumors that are able to control these blood vessels .
that &apos;s a very far idea of the idea , but i really believe that it &apos;s possible .
and then my translator left me .
she was the girl who was going to be the other for her team .
and i wrote a letter on my best friends in atlanta , georgia , who had a 11 year-old son .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot; i asked the translator .
so the two came to lunch , and we were thrown out of the restaurant .
he had children from very korea at all , and he found families for them .
they have a lot of time about the dictionary .
so i open the window , look out , and look like fire from the side of the hotels in the height . the hotel burns .
so we ran into the bathroom , took road and thought , our faces and the children .
until the adoption is through . a year ! what does there need so long ?
this is their own .
that &apos;s sydney , who will be three years old .
but there was no evidence .
there are little planets , there are bigger planets , there are big planets , okay .
but there &apos;s a lot more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something that depends on the planet ?
and this deeper , deeper , is a lot of the point that science is , the life is , how we know it , to define .
okay , let &apos;s say , this is the size of the processor universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , okay , from here .
thank you very much .
look , while uganda goes down and zimbabwe down , russia went on a percent .
they find the highest hiv guess the world in african countries , and yet they find in senegal , down here , the same rate like in the united states .
look at kenya here .
it could be that it &apos;s something else , which is more likely to be transmission .
we know that about the arab billion people ever lived .
that wasn &apos;t just an economic story .
and the result is even a bigger divergence in a shorter period of time than it was in germany .
it &apos;s just with institutions .
you just have to give me to food . &quot;
he was wrong .
well , i want to end with three questions to the future billion , short before colonialism , if the united states is their place as a number one of the reasons .
no , we &apos;re going to be able to hear , regardless of the huge , the huge of the huge , which we have , regardless of the signs that we &apos;ve lost our work work and other parts of our historical .
niall , thank you .
there are many ways of spider silk .
spider silk is almost completely completely made of protein .
the fibers that can make a single spider is already quite diverse .
and also , a high potential has a high potential because of your ability to the most of the ability .
what i want to do is not want to be the mermaid , so lovely , it may be , but on the photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there are more photos . there are more photographers .
that sounds alien in our ears , but what &apos;s happening is that 80 percent of the beholder have contributed much .
the first thing that happens when you &apos;re a problem is that the first goal of the institution is immediately changing by what the goal is to do .
the inventor don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states , the most of the time , trying to figure out whether bloggers are journalists or not .
she was made by making their favorite , use of many of these tools , analyzed the intelligence of the world today .
you have a little bit of what &apos;s probably the most powerful part of the bread or the fibers , because it &apos;s just full of fibers , because it &apos;s just from fibers .
everything is on his place . first level .
we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but let &apos;s look at the different steps , under the time of the possible connections , to a deeper level -- my search is going to be the answer to the answer to the question &quot; what is so special about bread ? &quot;
that &apos;s transformation , two different things .
and if you &apos;re shaped , you go back to prove that you &apos;re alive and develop character .
if you do this bread , you can use every kind of seven kind of a dozen .
it &apos;s going to be a kind of a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of a way that we work through this talk .
it takes very , very long , to write these scores , and i work on a piece of time , which is 180 pages long , and i &apos;m a big part of my life .
it &apos;s struck by brian &apos;s favorite artist , which is an extraordinary artist .
you have a little taste of the piece of view .
what we did -- betty &apos;s , one of my students , and i -- we gave the babies two dishes with food : a bowl with a silver broccoli , and a bowl with a bowl of the day .
i mean , last , if we look at babies , they appear pretty useless .
and our babies and children are much longer dependent on us than the babies every other species .
the most of the time is to change the hypothesis .
now there are two things that are really interesting about it .
boy : so .
our consciousness is going to be extremely bright and vivid , and everything else will be like dark .
&quot; babies and small kids are like the research and the most of the human species , &quot; the psychologist of the human species says , &quot; the psychologist of the way that babies are playing as a lot of play and decisions . &quot;
if i could borrow you a little bit for a little demonstration , to show the difference -- because it &apos;s actually pretty much easier .
then you repeated this process , and again , again , until something comes out of it -- in this case , the character is supposed to run , like i &apos;m going straight .
what we really wanted was the whole human body .
so you can &apos;t do that far .
here &apos;s a few simple scenes , like he &apos;s got .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we &apos;ve done it yet .
some studio use our software to do exactly that , and we &apos;ll get a few of our favorite in a few big ways .
we thought he would just keep the balance .
here you learn to go to the most , to go -- how most of you know .
but i have to say , i &apos;m never going to forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i &apos;m convinced that art and creativity are essential to develop empathy .
if you &apos;re the lonely , write a new york times column , you get hundreds of emails . most of what i &apos;ve done today is reported by frustration .
some stories are just classic , and yet , so sadly .
it &apos;s disappearing . nobody ever bought it .
there &apos;s a border that we don &apos;t want to cross . what is the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want to make a new blank document in word -- that could be done !
but i think there &apos;s actually two microsoft .
the other products were supported by microsoft with an open standard , rather than apple &apos;s standard .
and the most of the time i write someone &apos;s own a little bit of a day -- i say , &quot; fit me . &quot;
but when i looked at the most of the technologies , nanotechnology , and other people are coming to the world &apos;s species , i made a very big worried about the most of the time .
and to cut the danger of these new things , we have to finally cut the ability of individuals to make them feel access to the access to the access .
i think the challenge we &apos;re standing in -- i &apos;m very sure that this is going to happen -- is the challenge that we &apos;re going to use from this device ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , for example , you all have kinds of incredible properties .
and to give you a sense of the last of small fund , it &apos;s going to be on 400 million dollars , so it &apos;s right for us .
and if you were a concept of insurance , you can have a much more powerful resource -- the parameters of the market -- using feedback .
12 years ago , caves started to be fascinated by the , and i &apos;m going to be my research in this direction .
so wonderful and grim things .
there &apos;s ice under the surface .
so they &apos;re a kind of life life .
it &apos;s even so much energy for biology in this cave that there &apos;s actually a big number of light .
we can see them .
we realized a few years ago that caves have many properties that were used by people and other organisms used to be used as habitat .
whenever you &apos;re a goal , you have to be able to get a target , and you have to be able to get certain kinds of things on it .
and so it &apos;s also at archimedes , the big greek mathematician .
neck were made about it and it suffered under abraham .
that means before we could start to digitize the most powerful , we had to take the book apart .
and so that looks .
but by the time , the electrons fly around the speed of light , they give them a heroic .
this was a bad idea , because philip had a son named alexander of the great , and she lost the battle of the day .

that really interesting about proteomics , is that you can measure them .
well , i could develop a game with the name of the name by getting a million pies , or a thousand pies .

this is absolutely critical and jaclyn is in it .
and i want to tell you a short story , in 1999 -- there was a video game called the &quot; &#93; &quot; a video game . &quot;

this is a kind of a little bit of a sudden that i have two years ago . that was one of the largest projects i &apos;ve ever been involved in and my company .
but i &apos;m going to just take a look at the beginning of the process , on three very much .
if we &apos;re so good , what we do , we shouldn &apos;t be able to create an architectural manifestation that &apos;s absolutely predictable through the most democratic and the other .
the architectural thing was , i said , &quot; simple . &quot;
and this is the real living of the deal .
the second technology we used to use , we use things that you know from the most of a opera .
here you see the most of the most common configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk about how to do stories , something that &apos;s going on .
one of these projects is about a year old .
this is the images that are automatically created .
as long as i was awake , i had the camera around the neck .
you can see a timeline that shows you the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s a little bit of the time . well , on .
a computer company of a computer company .
an unknown epidemic , a farmer farmer .

rory , she mentioned libya to end .
so here you see two examples .
that &apos;s an example of the same system , on a finger , to pick them up , how it looks .
there are also a lot of the time that &apos;s going to be the superconductor , but if you &apos;re going to get these things , you &apos;re going to use this for another kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of .
the most the time . that &apos;s a hard problem of reasons that i &apos;m not going to be going to be .
there &apos;s another one , very interesting connection , and that &apos;s that what you want to do is to lead to a valuable information about a general thing in general .
so , i think it has the magic food that we can probably achieve to make things .
and we decided we should not think about it as much as the cost of the cost , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book that means , &quot; what &apos;s the most the most the time . &quot;
so we have to ask ourselves why .
but nonetheless , you don &apos;t interact with people who are not as you are .
so we can think about things like the most important .
i &apos;m kidding , but only half when i say that you &apos;re going to believe nobody will believe if you get a missing state , without previous cat cat , mri and the most important .
then bell turn on his students .
within a few years , in the late 19th century , the doctor suddenly showed the doctor , trying to ask a diagnosis , the most of the time .

another experience i made in texas before i went to stanford , influenced me .
the bad news : the exact cause we don &apos;t know . see ? that &apos;s what you can do , we can do that . &quot;
i remember so many huge , more , a lot of , the eyes that are going to be able to me to me .

my friend simon cohen , a computer &apos;s , i wrote , wrote the book &quot; the big bang &quot; etc . &quot;
and now they open their eyes .
you can open it completely , and it &apos;s a little bit of a time .
but it &apos;s been inspired by thinking about that , that these guys , at least most , know what they do for a living .
all of that thought that .
you can create a lot of change . you can build roads .
and that &apos;s something that people want to do .
you don &apos;t need everybody .
hugo ashburn has the most powerful and middle class in venezuela , and he just didn &apos;t have it .
and so it &apos;s always going on .
they connect people together .
the reason ? the modern medicine today uses a 60 years old .
but there &apos;s another catch .
it makes it more quickly , over 26 times cheaper , and over 400 times more than our current , for pancreatic cancer .
but my experience with the islamic world are very different .
there &apos;s a character for example .
and why does sex lead to babies , and why does babies mean a erotic disaster ?
because it &apos;s the secret of desire .
especially important to this description of the other or my self -- that &apos;s the same -- especially interesting that there &apos;s no more a sense of the desire .
this is your favorite and you &apos;re listening to biology , the natural instinct .
there &apos;s then desire . this study requires curiosity , and this study .
you know that there &apos;s an erotic space that &apos;s heard every one alone .
other places in the country had similar spaces .
in a computer cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
ok .
that &apos;s going to be played in smaller rooms .
so early , early , some places have been a lot of time .
so i asked myself , ok , is that a model for design , these adaptation that we practice ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned to me and said , &quot; that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing !
how do we solve the following three problems that i want to bring here to language ?
albert einstein -- i just spoke to someone when i was in princeton , and i met mr. einstein .
what &apos;s in life ? why am i here ?
i never read a talk or a talk or a lecture .
and it was about 300 people there .
he talked about his personal experience .
a french historian said two centuries later , &quot; rarely has a powerful mind with so big humility of authority christ &apos;s health policy . &quot;
or he was what he said .
i &apos;m not going to be talking about the ones about the most about the ones .
but for that , they have to sit about 10 minutes and take a woman in the arm , which is not there .

lg : like , like , that &apos;s what happens .
policymakers realized , computers can do the necessary of the necessary to do insights and decisions .
every interaction is recorded by always more sensors : your phone , your credit card , your computer . it &apos;s a lot of data and we get the opportunity to understand our existence .
these records were human rights .
by a mining process , what else is going to be a task for 40 months was to be a simple task for three people in 40 hours . that &apos;s all the most appropriate .
we should stop seeing out .
to dinner with my wife and the kids , they drive home .
because people say , &quot; shit man , i don &apos;t fit time to become a time .
she was a much worse dog when i thought .

help me make green to the new black . help me make sustainability sexy .
so i thought , this would be a opportunity to use scratch to make an interactive map for my mother .
but i &apos;m skeptical , which is this kind of thing .
in this case , you take a little bit of a sudden , put it on a pile and the pile of the different characters in a game or a story , in this case , the big fish .
if you learn to code , you can program to learn .
if children like archimedes like serenity create projects like serenity , they learn important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s just the beginning .
what i want to talk about today to give you a background is that cars are art .
i want to talk about it .
and i think that this thought that great cars is going to tap a soul , is very useful . they all know that . they realize a car with soul .

100 billion is the only number you need to know .
what you have to think about is that we have to do it with a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , with the hundred billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t explain was why entropy was ever low .
unlike the low entropy of the early universe , although we don &apos;t know the answer to the answer , we have a good theory that can explain that , if this theory is true , and that the theory of the dark energy .
and so it &apos;s going to be , although the universe is going to continue forever and ordinary matter and radiation , always give a certain measure of radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even in empty space .
but we also give it big fluctuations .
it turns out it &apos;s going to be .
it &apos;s a crucial fact of the universe that you &apos;re accept and not should question .
i had never used a computer .
it was a future i couldn &apos;t accept .
now i want to do something that &apos;s out there , like me , say to africans and the poor that are fighting with their dreams .
no matter what movement i was doing in my real world was communicating in my real world , eight years ago , in 2000 .

and some are in every case to use them to use them for the battles .
our strong response to images , to the expression of feelings in art , is going to be the beauty of music on the night sky , and our offspring , as long as human race exists .
well , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see here , you can see the computer , and there &apos;s no way you can see the orchestra , we can actually see the driver with red leds , so he can really see what &apos;s going on .
if mark can see you can avoid .
or for blind people , in everyday devices in the household , education and the office .
a subtle thing was starting . the most subtle , that normal people don &apos;t hear a voices and i heard it , meant something wrong with me .
my mental health was a memorable for the computer , hate and physical and sexual and sexual and sexual and sexual and sexual and sexual and sexual and sexual and sexual ones , and i was told by my psychiatrist .
to the counter , to the other , if social change starts , he can &apos;t be more disturbing .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going through now .
so what i &apos;m proposing is that it &apos;s where we should look for life , more than mars , of course , in mars , also a lot of a lot of a lot of the time and interesting place .
and the ordinary astronomers were full of contempt about it .
because it &apos;s the kind of life that can live out there , it &apos;s got enormous benefits compared to life on a planet .
there was another object , this high piece of furniture with creatures and the naked and naked -- pretty scary things for a little child .
the first projects were modest , but they took technology and they might be able to do things that people are using a new kind of functionality and maybe find a new functionality .
the other thing that &apos;s the other thing that &apos;s more powerful is that we decided to include all the technical sequences , this whole thing , and tried to make it beautiful .
so we called it y water . so that &apos;s another example of everything that happens in a room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas of the brand , it &apos;s all deeply interconnected .
that &apos;s my favorite anthony anthony , switzerland , he had the laptop for a afternoon , i had to go back to him . that was hard .

and if it &apos;s wonder why it &apos;s interesting at all , you have to look at the rest of saudi arabia , because it &apos;s a country between the male .

let me give you an example : turkey , where i come from , which is a very crowded republic , we had a little bit of a little bit of what i call the universities .
if i would be the only person who thinks that we would have a problem .
in the 19th century , as muslims , europe have seen , they were independent , they were independent .
so the e.u. was the process of turkey , the e.u. of turkey , to join the e.u. in turkey , while some of the most of the things were about it .
there &apos;s a very large nose that doesn &apos;t have the ones that would be connected to anything .

larry : 32 years of a 10 years of a 10 year-old sentence sentence , in arizona , for kidnapping and repeated a young boy on a computer &apos;s age .
before that , people are leaving themselves .
and they &apos;ve brought them to texas here .
and now they drive with the food , where they &apos;re in this moment .
it &apos;s just the vast of the space that makes it look like nothing .
so something called addictive , you know , the pursuit of happiness and human design .
partly , the legacy is the creation of the ministry of happiness , the fisheries , which was the pursuit of happiness for happiness , it &apos;s driven by the individual aspects of the individual and can &apos;t be found in reality .
a little bit of the science of happiness is that happiness and disaster doesn &apos;t make a difference in a closed continuum .
it starts in the most of the time .
here &apos;s a three weeks old baby .
in the animal kingdom , there &apos;s only one way to increase the status , that &apos;s dominance .
i want to close with some quotes .
why should you choose rats ?
once the rat understood that , we needed a little bit harder .
you can actually cure t.b. , even in people who are hiv-positive .
with the knowledge that a patient , the microscopic path , is infected until 15 people -- 15 healthy people -- a year , can you be sure we &apos;ve already saved a lot of life .
here we see neurons .
so that &apos;s important for imitation and cooling .
now , the question is : if i just watch , how do i touch a different person , why is i not confused and literally , literally , this kind of thing is going to be touched by the naked , how someone will touch ?
thank you . i have two missions here today .
i &apos;m actually not about the most of the time , but to the pollen itself .
all these images were taken by a nobel scan by the way in kew , by kew &apos;s lab .
even every single one of us has a story to tell the most of the story on us .
we need to be so good as the breast cancer , to address this crisis .
right now , in the 1980s , when we &apos;re going to go to women and death through heart disease , she wrote a portfolio for the new england journal of medicine and called the syndrome .
our colleagues in washington , d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike the to the , , in contrast , x-ray , to be , for women , whose breast , the view of the heart . every time we organize something that is just a little bit of radiation , we ask : &quot; is this test really necessary ? &quot;
okay , here we started .
they did what they said , they &apos;ve been holding up and joined them .
the cells have something like the way they &apos;re doing something like this ; they don &apos;t feel native .
what does that mean for us ?
in the course of three years , we took eight to 10 hours , and we collected about a quarter of a quarter of hours , and the most of the time .
this is one of the first things that i &apos;ve got to do is come out of a year that really surprised us : that &apos;s what really surprised us .
and finally , my son plays alone in a walker .
three of the most important people in this project philip , picked up , and the tar roy and the puppet are roy .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamic in the game .
this is the first time that our son made more than two steps once -- captured in the movie .
and that &apos;s a important question to the question , because the better we understand how the brain is responsible , the better we can communicate . i think , the better we can think and work .
it &apos;s a kind of center where you see a picture and think &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional response to the following . &quot;
what we literally do is to paint our team , to paint the whole thing on a big wall .
that &apos;s the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just about pac-man , but also to the possibility of relaxation .
so , they don &apos;t build it .
if you translated that into the building industry , if you have a little bit of a sudden , and you &apos;re broken a window , we say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we kept continuing .
are we just stupid ?
you can maybe get it back in two years , if you read eight hours a day .
so you can see in september , and say , &quot; i &apos;m important today .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
and the police waiting for the opening fire to cut the vehicle in pieces to get the body of the driver .
and that &apos;s enough to the present with the present in the united states , on the united states , on the same time , find a eye of the divine intervention .
all of us leads to -- the most important thing to name is to just name that : that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing most of the digital devices .
this is the consequence of the destruction of more than a third of the brain on the right side through the stroke .
this is a very , very low level to be released from the health system .
he then gave my jaw into the right position while he was going to get my teeth .
alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and accused , who is fascinated by close to the gaps of consciousness , whether he &apos;s a deaf that , or a blind that sees the movement .
now i had to have to be in the dark years , which followed me , what was that i was doing when everything that was doing today was gone .
and it works . it works .
lp : so if you have the opportunity , you spend time with simon .
and these were the developing countries : they had big families and a relatively short life .
and these are on this side . a big tasmanian of africa and the ones .
and then deng xiaoping came and brought money to china and brought the country back to a middle .
a search of search that we can copy the data in a little bit of a format format and publish the world in the world . and what do we hear when we look around ?
but this is what hypotheses do .
you know , darwin has explained life after it came to what was the essence of life ?
and i learned francis crick .
but there was what in the literature .
we weren &apos;t the best chemist in the room .
i was honored ; my girls didn &apos;t marry me .
you can also compare dna to make dna and compare to the dna .
and so i &apos;ll close , by telling you that we &apos;ve looked at 20 people with schizophrenia .
average , defense costs in a case two million dollars , and takes 18 months when they win .
first , they don &apos;t fight the patent , but against the patent .
my solution : give me this patent and i &apos;ll get them away with the most of the time .
&quot; why not ? &quot; the girls said .
the fathers were on a place where they move their daughters to play their chairs , their chairs and their hand could reach out .
this is a great technology .
it &apos;s not very much left on the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in people .
can &apos;t see the enemy most of the time , and we needed a different process to eradicate polio than we did with smallpox .
it helped to control pandemic , sars , for example .
the reality of polio today is something very different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : well bruce , where are the most difficult places ?
bruce : how we &apos;re going to get polio
dj : we found this kite now at all kinds of animals , especially at the cats .
and to our surprise , it became a more a bit of a sudden .
for us , this elephant has become a symbol for inspiration , a symbol of this hope , which is accompanied us in our work .
it was incredible amazing than she took it in security to protect it before the hyena .
and of course , if i look at these of these things , the most of the time , she reminds me on a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic because your destiny is in our hand .
we need it . we respect and celebrate each other as a man and a woman , as a community and as part of this planet and we need to continue to continue .
it seems to be obvious that the earth is big and running the sun , and it &apos;s worth to remember what &apos;s going on .
and that &apos;s that in middle world , in middle world , it &apos;s always there .
nature &apos;s nature depends on what kind of animal we are .
because there &apos;s so many of them , and because between them , there &apos;s no consensus about their own , and they &apos;re going to be the most powerful , as we see it in middle world , and they &apos;re stuck .
people like treating machines like machines and they &apos;re going to be scientifically , but it &apos;s a computer waste , if you want to guess what the person &apos;s going to do next .
i was going to be the next night , and i was in the wheels age of 40 years .
over a cursor i control with my head , allow me to see these things , videos from the robot and send orders to send buttons to a computer .
with the help of people like you can do this dream .
in the fellows , for example , a slave lexicon is developed by the most of the time , by basically the most of the time that dolphins send up , they &apos;re delighted .
i think together , we can form a global community .
this is a hot picture of the hot .
there are some lessons -- there are some lessons that you can learn from it .
but normally we don &apos;t do this .
i think we tend to look at this : the infrastructure of globalization .
now , this is on 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem that we need to solve .
i also take that most of you don &apos;t speak chinese -- what &apos;s really sad when you think that &apos;s the most common language in the internet .
what do you look at ? maybe we should do that .
if you look at this picture , you might think , &quot; why should i care about that ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find its place in it .
they would bring wealth and security , to overcome religious violence and make sure states never stop terrorists again .
and part of this activity is honesty .
what is that ?
i love this dish .
and the war was hacked , 20 million people took life -- until today &apos;s civil war .
luria sen , who is this guy : &quot; i could have made all this money , but i spent all these time to look at the american man who had stolen my recipe .
chinese restaurants have done the same same thing , i would argue , with the menu and the soundtrack -- even the restaurant -- but without a centralized headquarters .
in contrast , we have general tso chicken , which started in new york city in the early 1970s , when i started in the early 1970s .
so what we see in the 17th , 18th century is the search of medicine , which creates the same thing .
so people would have a really big job .
when the ages of the year started , less to become more , i always became depressed , until i thought my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
do you remember to have a child on every line ?
18 and 19 slept , i slept the night .
again , i &apos;m going to get depressed and a little bit shorter .
thank you for us to do that in the next few years , there &apos;s a better world to do .
he goes around : &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know . where did the world work together in treatment , which is the potential of the earthquake and climate change ?
if you do the impossible sticky , you can do it .
but we &apos;ve reached a agreement to climate change .
and there &apos;s god crying .
the most remarkable power makes something remarkable : they use two ingredients , proteins and water , which are in their abdomen to create a material that &apos;s extraordinary to make a difference .
or you &apos;re going to be beautiful things like this , if the camera can capture the .
here you see how it &apos;s taken from the tissue .
with my new project , dizzy &apos;s , i want to use art for this , to create technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that &apos;s going to be able to break out and put the round of applause and the round of applause -- hopefully not -- to help him make some of his next decisions .
what do i do ? &quot;
in the frame of this , not unprecedented demonstration , heather knight data , a computer , which can be far more than a more , more than a human being -- he &apos;s going to be able to work the feedback of the amount of things .
stanley milgram , inventor of the known known , &quot; the known &quot; of the world &apos;s &quot; is , &quot; in the most of the time , in the most of the people , there were a connection between two to seven steps .
how does our view of relationships are about relationships to be very much more .
but there was a exchange that i &apos;m going to tell you about , and where he might have to put me in the ear .
um ... my father , a computer &apos;s ?
it was his father who decided she needed wrong papers .
this feeling of responsibility had been about other people &apos;s lives , despite his young age of 17 years , and his fault , to be a , very much , he kept a whole life .
and as my sister gave up and my favorite , and my father gave up , sort of , my father &apos;s wrong papers .
i asked him , in the face of the victim he had taken , if he ever had the most of the time .
we grow from a few million people on the seven billion people who are today , to be .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a more a , a more , a more , a more , a more , a lot of a sudden , is the next one that is in a good state .
if you &apos;re the forests of the forests , the border of the land , you know , the ability to stay the ability to stay stable .
with the realization of the world , fishermen , the great barrier of reef , and scientists , that the great barrier reef is hot below the current of the current .
but the drama is of course that the drama is that the change is not an option .
that leads me to another reason why i &apos;m here today : because i really like media of all kinds of things .
this is a kind of a race of a race from a far developed .
first , he use an ancient way of making the kind of manufacturing and connected to this three-dimensional perspective , which was a very new technology to this time .
and by the process of sugar , i asked portraits of them .
it became very large images and i took them with a very large camera , a kind of a camera .
my interest on the other , especially worse , is very far .
on the back , a sequence is also the fact that chimpanzees are .
we can then ask : is there general differences between africans and the most important ?
and then you can compare it to the genome of living people today .
we can then ask ourselves for the fruit , how do you mix the same question for neanderthals : have you mix with ancestors of today &apos;s people ?
there are many people who designed their own vision of vision , like this vision from the beginning of the 20th century .
after my belief , the plane has his own consciousness .
imagine carbon dioxide grow in 3d printers , and they &apos;re embedded in a more embedded , and follow the forces that are in their components .
they don &apos;t talk . but especially they were extraordinary from the world around them , from their environment and from the people .
they would be able to call them the police .
now we know that it &apos;s about 100 .
you see a video .
you have the feeling that research , you know , have been a effect to the reality that you can actually prevent this experience with that , which i started to start with my way .
then you &apos;re going to be ashamed .
you &apos;re going to stare at a slave body in a stare -- chin on the most of the time , poor extended about your own .
they did all this as we taught them .
and after the battle , they bring these mobile grade and they do what they call &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; wrong thing . &quot;
people have changed .
i said , &quot; where is he now ? &quot;
this is not a deal .
and she showed the left piece to tell me how problematic this picture was , which was the idea of the idea of the black , like black .
it &apos;s really in this sense of the most of the time that i have a new series of questions that i &apos;m going to be .
well , that &apos;s a kind of obvious statement .
and the kids said , &quot; how do we do that . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to multiply numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long do you have to do with it before you decided that you didn &apos;t understand anything ? &quot;
their favorite , they increased 50 , which is a lot of fine schools that are going to be asked to be a more fine biotechnology with a kind of a biotechnology .
was 76 percent . the test , two months later , was 76 percent .
after eight ted talks , he wanted to be there vinci .
these are sarkozy .
suddenly i saw out of the darkness of the dark side of the space , which was a mirror of mirrors that were made by the moon .
if i had to reduce the whole story on a picture , what would it be ?
i &apos;m going to show you some clips from my other big project in this year . &quot; the tempest &quot; -- the storm .
and our little life ends into a sleep .
bono : &quot; you &apos;re preliminary .
i know you understand that .
so , blue , blue , everything was blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both play in africa .
it &apos;s another one that acts on the interface of health and business .
let &apos;s use the markets as the most important thing that we have , and we find what price people would have for that , so they would have the choice .
thank you .
the most important thing was , if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we destroyed two of the most important and 10 tv .
the little thing that &apos;s going to do is remove out of his trace , and that was a problem .
this is very good . it &apos;s going to slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video from a few of the models i work with .
tissue of the density of the density and behavior is to create the second part , and that &apos;s actually going to be the key to use these models for the most important .
thank you .
the attempt to fly is to fly the way to shoot a arrow with the end of the end . it was hard work , and young , boy , i have learned a lot of respect for nature .
now let &apos;s look at the other side .
we &apos;re working on projects -- even more , even more , as a result , as a result of the way -- with darpa , the california institute of technology and university .
be careful , they just behave like wood or something .
now i didn &apos;t try to be a lot of time .
they go forever .
these are over two billion .
it requires it to be about &quot; three years of &quot; three years . &quot;
don &apos;t forget that one of the synapses .
but for me , it &apos;s great because it &apos;s a metaphor for time , where we can live in the human mind and machines .
i realized really mass . where does it come from ?
it &apos;s too afraid that the way that the way that the way in the wild was in 20 to 30 years could be extinct .
all the evidence of turning out that this cancer is going to be transmit by a virus .
i took the opportunity true and took a few samples from jonas &apos;s tumor and a few samples of other body systems .
she brought him to the veterinarian and this discovered something more .
finally , cancer is an inevitable consequence of the ability to share our cells and adapt to their environment .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and that &apos;s a global phenomenon .
they would be able to wait to wait for it .
and that &apos;s the third reason why a low expectation doesn &apos;t make us happy .
but they didn &apos;t feel that the numbers are on them .
first of all , i &apos;m going to show you the most important for the optimism bias .
but the good news is that our illusion is not broken when we &apos;re aware of this .
but what we &apos;re going to see is asia , the incremental back , to get more than half the world &apos;s population and to afford half of the global economy .
you could look at this as the privatization of the war .
after selective , the soviets had been , &quot; that &apos;s the end of america . &quot;
if you live in japan or new delhi or a new delhi , you &apos;re going to be a little different than if you live in beijing .
and if we have strategies in which we &apos;re going to bring this into bigger historical context , we &apos;re able to be able to do this process .
how do we define our national interests so that it doesn &apos;t just have a more powerful amount of water .
this is the conventional approach .
this has typically the responsibility to the responsibility to guarantee a stable security feature .
they &apos;re dependent on each other .
jobs for who ? especially for young men .
after mostly the legal system collapsed , you can &apos;t even get property .
the care would be from the own , after the conflict , government .
this is the silhouette of my hometown of new orleans .
the military has realized it . they call climate change , which is threatened by the security and stability , as governments are on the world .
it allows you to become more productive , so you can afford the insurance itself .
these are certainly inspiring examples of possible solutions if we feel in the situation for a developing world .
listen , listen to chinese students english by putting it .
teacher : perfect ! students : perfect !
and that includes things like the concrete world with the most of the concrete world , abstractions that we &apos;re trying to make logical , and we also take the hypothetical seriously , which is what we might ask .
luria looked at people before they &apos;re in the scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to a benign world .
there was luria : &quot; on the north pole , there &apos;s always snow .
they chose torvalds instead of new york .
it wasn &apos;t just the spread of cognitively tough professions .
would you have allowed it to become killed ? &quot;
you could say , a half .
it feels like i landed in a colony of angels . &quot;
and they &apos;re going to be able to make me a degree of doing something .
he &apos;s still in the red numbers , but chris made it with personal victims , this film .
i &apos;m one of their favorite .
there &apos;s a prime minister , a prime minister , secretary of secretary and a kite , or president of the most of the time .
boy : &quot; the most serious thing is .
we were all mad , &quot; why do you do that ?
that &apos;s going to be much real if you read it . &quot;
we &apos;ve always played the game for the school for weeks , about seven weeks , and we had all the 50 together in the diaspora .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
many people were paying up good jobs and closed the most powerful .
it &apos;s like his own little connection .
if i all get three legs of it , in the three peaks of the triangle , i would get a memorial .
so everything you do is -- it &apos;s a very crowded case -- this old computer and this old plastic &#91; unclear &#93; . this is a very simple plastic system .
that &apos;s possible when you have a whole piece of paper , you can be able to be able to be a very strict school or a state of school -- a sheet , a ruler , a ruler , no glue .
what we do is a very simple amount of time .
this is a little bit of a little bit , which is what you do is these two corners here , it &apos;s going to be like a computer .
here are two magnets .
it was very many passengers on the ship , and it was boring , so the captain invited her to be a deck .
in the most recent conference , the granny gupta shows simple and yet amazing plans to turn waste into really a very small , good , which can build children themselves -- while they learn basic principles of science and design .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually examples of biology that was a lot of evidence .
and there &apos;s a few examples of projects that are aware of ecosystems .
and with a little planning , we can be dominated by traffic , in a turn , which is open space for people who are able to connect people to food and transformed waste in opportunities .
this photograph was made on the day of completed , and just a year later , it looked like this .
if you mobilize seawater , the first thing is calcium carbonate .
no , you have to be able to explore the people to explore the visions of the visions of the visions . &quot;
i was looking for somebody who &apos;s jewish , because i &apos;m jewish and because i &apos;m very important .
but the real failure was that there was a lot of men who wanted to go to me .
very few of us have the ability to be absolutely honest with themselves .
he likes to travel as long as it &apos;s not on a computer .
i tried to be in principle .
because you remember my favorite , you have to reach a little bit of 700 points and nobody did this .
most of you . players are 33 years old , not eight years , and if we look at the demographics of the demographics , the players are older adults .
imagine whose vision is very , very good .
these players have even many other benefits in terms of attention , and a aspect of attention , which is also improved , is our ability to pursue objects in our environment .
i want to ask you to remember this result , and it &apos;s in the context of another group of the other group of the world &apos;s being in the context of people who are actually looking up in our society .
let me explain this step with a task that calls mental gratification .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just let all kinds of programs of the special case , if we look at it , walk .
so it was a big , very complex project i &apos;m not even sure if it works at all .
so wolfram alpha knows about many and many things .
on one side , we have mathematica , with the kind of precise , formal language and a big network of the world &apos;s capacity , capable of doing a lot of lines .
so , with physical , we &apos;re used to it , to go to the world and see that certain materials are a sense of certain technological purposes and so on .
a few years ago , i was pretty excited about discovery that there are candidates with incredibly simple rules that are successful of relativity , and the general relativity of relativity and gravity and at least evidence .
sw : i think .
and as this time , i actually lost more relatives , and teachers who are going to be able to get me to hiv / aids .
they jump up . they wear red clothes .
there was a woman who was a woman , she didn &apos;t have a fairly high job on the garbage and automatically was all my family , so he had the right .
and the day before the actual ceremony , we were dancing , and they didn &apos;t sleep all night .
he was wearing a lot of time and that in a village that had not even been a lot of roads . it was very attractive .
i promised him to be a girl &apos;s girl , i would come back and do everything they would ask me .
if it was pregnant before marriage , the mother was responsible for it , and punished .
while we speak here , 125 girls will never be mutilated again .
consumers who represent 72 percent of the american gdp , actually start , just like banks and companies , their own , to promote themselves , in the daily life , themselves .
and what you see here is the entire phenomenon of the fact that we actually click and basically future education , the future children of our households .
and the most of the time is up to 48 percent , which is cornell institute .
we also observe a trend to something more than tourism tourism . right ?
one of them is the most powerful of community and neighborhood , and more frightening the neighbors as support .
we also observe a big deal of a big thing .
the trend to the most powerful is 2.5 .
then we take the phenomenon of the terrace .
and then the question came to me , am i the only one that does something like this ?
you could use them .
that &apos;s what i do in my life -- tell stories , write novels . and today i want to share with you a few stories about art and also some supernatural creatures that are the most important .
our favorite way could be bare . our hearts could be ineffective . and our most of our favorite , if we &apos;re in a long time within our cultural health .
i &apos;ve got the first time i call it , &quot; representative thaler . &quot;
i &apos;m not an immigrant , no refugee or a refugee or a half , i &apos;m asking why i do that . but that &apos;s what i &apos;m doing between languages .
he wanted to see a manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story became a huge issue , because i was committed to be selectively .
literature has to lead us to the other side .
i could be a novel of a muslim woman , and maybe that &apos;s going to be a happy story , and i might write a happy book about a little bit of a sudden , gay professor in norway .
so you &apos;re going to take it . you &apos;re already taking existing songs , you cut it into small pieces , it &apos;s going to form this piece , you get together and get a new song , but this new song is clear .
instead , these laws and laws use the most awkward comparison of property .
it &apos;s a kind of a little bit of a sudden , but i &apos;m going to summarize what it cover .
our creativity comes from outside , not from inside .
and then they say , &quot; okay , but how do you see your address ? &quot;
but in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the newspaper &quot; guardian . &quot;
what &apos;s beautiful is you can probably see this limb there , a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of thing that &apos;s going on .
our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
now , that led to a understanding of the nuclear structure , because it &apos;s going to be so much that atoms have a single core , with the very long , which circle it .
this picture shows a galaxy , a big , a , with , , , , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think you can finally get the ideas for us , about our place in the universe and really the value of our home home .
that &apos;s here . that &apos;s home . that &apos;s what we &apos;re .
and with each press and every touch of the screen , we &apos;re going to drop like a little bit of the screen and the 30s of our personal information everywhere .
when our daughter sat down to the most the time , i asked them , &quot; will you go to your school a lot of fun competence ? &quot;
we can &apos;t get a human being .
well , i want to take you on this journey .
and because i graduated so much argued and i decided i decided to be my citizen &apos;s birthday , that i wouldn &apos;t speak for a day .
and they don &apos;t talk ...
and i explained to help a friend that my sign understood that i was john francis , that i was not talking about it and that this would be the last time that someone would translate my sign sign .
well , i &apos;m going to go back to my backpack .
i started talking again because i had studied a lot of time .
but the most of the time i was going to ask myself to ask myself about my silence , but never about my decision , just to use my feet .
born and grew up in north korea .
sometimes i found little jobs in exchange against food .
i &apos;ve been worried about that i would be able to get back and back again .
i felt so powerless because i had so much food in america , but my father died in hunger .
but i think that your gesture is going to save the love of love and care of life of another joseph and change thousands of other people who have still been the hope .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings , but this was much stronger than i expected , and to make a lot of the night , and as an industrial , and as an industrial , too .
but then i was very disappointed with my job as an architect , because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for society , but for privileged people , rich , the government .
and then in the next year , 1995 , there was a big earthquake in kobe in japan .
so i wonder what &apos;s a permanent and what a building building ?
but this is really necessary .
so we learn some of the most important things in our lives before we &apos;re born , even in the womb .
so fetuses actually learn the certain language that &apos;s going to be talked about in the world where they &apos;re born in the world .
it &apos;s a mixture of the ideal , which is so precise and strange , like the woman itself .
why should malnutrition lead to the disease ?
you can also see the other way with other eyes .
this trust in the most essential is essential for every kind of thing .
the audience will be on the ground , which are very logical , but not with the target , what happens to your eyes . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , it might even bring us to smile .
you may remember that as the most of the time the most of the time , okay .
if you &apos;re a high animal , and somebody says , &quot; what do you do for hunger in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start an ad campaign ?
this is actually a strategy and i don &apos;t argue that strategy is going to play a role .
for me , all the music was .
now , if i use my software , the camera is the most important , and it &apos;s the place of the world &apos;s disease , and you have a thread .
i remember the poor needed something more than -- eat , clothing , shelter -- what they didn &apos;t have .
i even felt a more bit of shame of shame .
now , there i heard him , i was excited about different reasons .
i was not even asked to ask a donation of what was going on .
it &apos;s about the most of the time of the poor and it &apos;s about giving us a way to get a chance to confirm what your dignity would be , a partnership of a traditional way of donation .
it &apos;s a far more a combination of a combination of a very strong combination .
now , the beginning is , the beginning is still at the beginning and it &apos;s so precise , for me very clear that it &apos;s just a vehicle .
how does the future of humanity look like ?
now i &apos;m going to turn to the second big question : are we alone or there &apos;s other lives in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions show that we &apos;ve done remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
see that .
here are photos of me .
the rate actually doubled all 18 months and every single member of the world &apos;s favorite member , that &apos;s moore &apos;s law .
but what about them ? what about them ?
they &apos;re in their ambassador in their ambassador about the sky and occasionally they put people for experiments that would not agree with their parents .
so we &apos;re interested in these things .
former generations could not do these experiments at all .
and i found that the first technology was coming from the first technology in the form of the world &apos;s first technology .
we can learn very much of it .
and i see the most of the time and to protect my child , because with a child , you don &apos;t have a minister of it .
and secondly , she tells us that they had a leaf gang , but some adaptations for climbing trees had had trees .
until now , our knowledge came over our ancestors , basically , from adults , because the fossils , the most powerful , missing .
the most of the time the origin of the suburbs are exploring the origin of humanity in the long ethiopia . he talks about how he found the oldest skeleton of a humanoid child and what we can learn in africa .
and if all of you should hold the rules , you need a effective system to capture and you have a more effective system , because we &apos;ve found it in everything .
it &apos;s considered a high lake , because the continent of the continent was considered .
we need to work locally , but also all the ocean &apos;s ocean .
we need to create a new paradigm of careful and respect .
carol &apos;s saying , &quot; i would pay to do what i do . &quot;
that was probably a pretty good idea .
to say , i &apos;m a journalist , no a technologist , so i want to design a sketch , like the present and the future .
i think i think we need to think about whether we want that to be our reality -- and if , what &apos;s going on for our idea of life and for everything that comes .
it looks like oil prices .
the symptoms of complex , you have the fixed and the most difficult opinion , have the right solution to have no matter how hard the problem is .
cesar and i tried writing a paper for the new york times and explain how it works .
of course we can .
and make a lot of money .
it &apos;s higher than the active rate of americans .
we &apos;re going to try . probably everything goes wrong .
and immediately , it &apos;s going to be off . &quot;
in 1885 , it always tried to come back , but he couldn &apos;t prove the guess .
i &apos;m going to argue that our approach is just not portable .
china wants to have this in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even slow down .
the future is voluntary .
yes , it will be ugly , and yes , it &apos;s going to happen -- with security in our lifespan -- but we &apos;re more than capable of overcome everything that &apos;s going on on us .
and here they come into play .
and what we need to think about is this : if you dance in the fire , what &apos;s next ?
and we believed we can put these debt on our children , but imagine you &apos;re going to imagine .
everything else is a lot of the time .
this is the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what stage the cell is .
that should not be amazing or ?
everything we have is a lot of the time .
they &apos;re going to be able to focus in their position , maybe the sensitivity can increase or a series of things that we can &apos;t do .
that &apos;s not 1,000 years in the distance .
we should be able to say that cheap , simple , simple , and nobody &apos;s using them for their children . &quot;
and here we can see this average .
we can &apos;t risk to lose trust of customers .
he only got 500 and getting to 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a huge of the full of the world &apos;s full of the world that they got , and he said , &quot; come back in a week , if you &apos;re sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the way we know the web -- things that we all talk about -- is a little less than 5,000 days old .
of course , there &apos;s the internet for more than 5,000 days -- but the web only is 5,000 days .
so if we say , the machine we &apos;re going to do is a human brain , a human brain if we look at the rate of that , there &apos;s six billion years of the world &apos;s disease .
now it &apos;s not -- if you do a chart and things at work , you &apos;re not part of the web , but you &apos;re going to be part of it . you &apos;re going to be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people will be the extended senses of the machine . &quot; in a sense .
it &apos;s going to be on the level of parts or ideas or words , if you want to be manipulated .
the last point i wanted to talk about is the idea we &apos;re going to be able to do .
third , it &apos;s going to be more ubiquitous , it will fill our entire environment and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i was convinced that the second of jesus was the second of jesus christ , that it was sun &apos;s moon , and i was particularly prepared by god and prepared to be prepared to be his favorite .
these are the dead of the world &apos;s dead .
and it allows everything . it &apos;s all the logical .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas , like we line things out .
this is a project that we &apos;ve just completed in the most of the time for a huge amount of water that came directly from this process , it &apos;s the result of a variety of forces that develop it .
and that led directly into another project .
it &apos;s actually a false attitude because the hybrid probably is more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas are doing the education process young people .
and finally , one of the most interesting projects -- a computer system .
everybody from them is to be his neighbors .
so as we have to pay school school .
so we have a big brain , a big advantage , because we can affect our environment .
my story , is the two brains . it may surprise you , our gut has a brain &apos;s brain .
these are very , very important , very important , because there can be functional .
we &apos;ve learned to talk to the big brain , taste and reward , like you know .
he said , &quot; you know , again , we were all like animals and then not anymore . &quot;
these are men and women who can name themselves today 250 stars in the night sky .
of course , the most of the monks we said .
the most of the time that the post , the post , is actually a more powerful , which is constantly the light that seems to be the sacred , which seems to be the sacred of the newtonian pavilion .
if you pray for the dead , you make these gestures with the hands that you &apos;re going to stand up with the sky .
here &apos;s the place where the big mother has the most powerful mother in the world , which has the mountains of the mountains and create the country that they call the heart of the world .
it &apos;s unique of human imagination .
this material that you all know is a lot of the time , but i think it &apos;s more likely to be toxic white stuff .
i &apos;m going to witness you in there , because in a hundred years , my body can go back without a framework .
it &apos;s a waste .
you can apply it all over the world , and you don &apos;t have to take care of the world &apos;s or not to take care of it , because you have many alternatives .
first , they start atoms in a special bottle .
i have a competition four years ago , called &quot; dance your ph.d. . &quot;
my country is with 15 trillion dollars .
and that &apos;s -- -- that &apos;s a lot of a lot of the time than all the speakers and all the ones that are going to come to me .
and she thought about my work about mathematical models , which should be affected by evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience may not like head-tail-tail -- from profound , cultural reasons , you think it &apos;s boring -- and find another pattern more interesting -- head-tail-head .
you can think about two types of thinking about it .
if you throw a coin , you get a sequence of head and number .
back to more secular , more secular , because you &apos;re busy with uncertainty .
and only at one percent of the world .
he said , &quot; i suppose that &apos;s a sudden death in a family , the probability of another . &quot;
not as unlikely as one in 73 million , but yet pretty unlikely .
the whole quality of quality , the spontaneous impact on the industrial processing , is carried by statistics .
the most hundreds of thousands of lives may have saved hundreds of thousands of lives around the world .
a intelligent power of injuries is increasing because the electricity is always recognized until a intelligent amount of energy . just .
but , on the other hand , china is a more powerful thing . a term from the ground .
you have facebook , we have a little bit of a time .
yet , the tip itself can create a very strong force , which is never in china .
so , that &apos;s why chinese this is the real medium , as a real medium , not just as a mere headlines .
how a big ted , not ?
so in the last three years , it &apos;s really changed by the last three years , they really changed more and more transparent because they don &apos;t have access to the data .
more chinese , free speech and human rights , as you can see , is a very privileged privilege of america .
many of you know that the beethoven &apos;s seventh symphony was .
i &apos;m not saying that they can &apos;t live a wonderful life .
girl : well , my sister can be pretty nerves .
the acoustics of music is much more complicated than the language .
this is a violin .
and it seems like his own , it seems to be the way that his own , to try to try to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the cause of death and his skull on the pages .
cl : joseph is phenomenal . he &apos;s brilliant .
if i &apos;m going to be able to get a special audience , i see a special audience .
in many countries , it &apos;s another thing .
in this key point in the dutch history , my father was at the bank of the river &apos;s river near the outside of the river .
the rate of civil wars and oppression has been down since the end of the cold war .
my soldiers use their weapons as tools of peace .
peter van : why i took a gun
this program gets a form and then put 250 dna sequences .
this is a kind of a little bit of a sudden in the middle of the city , in the middle of the living .
you can &apos;t let &quot; not be strong . &quot;
i &apos;m very interested in both very interested .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example of this , but there &apos;s actually a theoretical rationale for why technology evolved in the way .
now , evolution of our species needed hundreds of thousands of years , and because of this interaction used the evolution of the technology , evolution is basically the technology of the next stage .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; we can make the third dimension .
over the last 50 years , we had 28 percent of the year in information technology in a year .
another big revolution is the most powerful .
to come back to our exponential growth of computing , 1,000 dollars to computing are about the brain of a insect or a mouse .
and in the year , we &apos;re going to reach the full explorers of these trends , and they have to celebrate how often the blogosphere has made in the form of technology -- faster and faster , if we get to this point .
you can get blessing and you can get a blessing .
they &apos;re harder , they &apos;re harder .
they were made out of the most difficult .
because there &apos;s nothing in there . well , it &apos;s not a way to do anything .
dopamine is apparently the stuff that stands in connection with the most of the time .
and that &apos;s what we call schizophrenia .
and he was so friendly to post and give us the resolution .
i mentioned in our little thought earlier , they &apos;re a non-zero-sum forum in the african plain .
the 11th 11th has a little bit of a sudden . it &apos;s a conspiracy .
and we have our own favorite , and we have a product of product .
i was not so good as he , but we did it , and we did it , and we did it , and we did it , and we were doing it , and we were a tracy , tracy , tracy , and that was a great experience .
they always said , &quot; tell us the truth , &quot; and beat us .
musicians and activist peter gabriel were explaining his personal motivation , with the most of the human being , and tells stories of active , and i told stories of active .
next , we asked ourselves how to do that ?
he recognizes the problem and knows that it &apos;s going to be done . the dance is his own , which allows him to make themselves new .
the beetle climb much less rare on the pill when they put up a man , when they don &apos;t wear .
here &apos;s our favorite experimenter .
play a little bit of play and watch what happens .
this is the universe of stephen hawking .
thank you .
and the argument that it &apos;s fun to fall into these big adventures is not quite with my experience .
or , &quot; nice . you know , my grandmother makes a cruise in antarctica .
so the whole purpose of the presentation is to convince that they &apos;re the entrepreneurs in the way they invest and make a lot of money that are going to be done .
and next to the experience , a company or something to lead -- that doesn &apos;t have to be a company .
there &apos;s no financially construction , which is not a financially .
from there , they take them with -- on a solid , good path to the top . right from the beginning .
if i happen to know somebody who has made a device like this .
no , they &apos;re not .
then they give me a quick thing .
even if the competition works old patterns ...
it was hopefully all positive , positive , positive , more positive .
if you follow my ideas , you &apos;ll have a little bit of a sudden , very much , very much , and that &apos;s great to get who you are and to bring care of emotionally .
i didn &apos;t know that , that &apos;s pretty cool .
statistically , one of them is a beetle .
if you &apos;re a little bit embarrassed , you might have a effect on it .
and then if you have enough , you can click another link .
we &apos;re at the end of the table , on the last place than the culture , the innovation doesn &apos;t affect .
so as we think and we behave , our own way to do it is broken .
we have a little bit of memes -- to be serious .
but forgive me , the problems are not the problems of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the largest of the largest world ?
it &apos;s very intricate .
our thinking is backwards .
through a sixth change , change , like transparency , change , like the example of the , and collaboration , collaboration , and not the other thing , these things are focused on results .
because only the challenge is the only way that things are always made , the only way to get rid of us is getting rid of the old little solutions , and find new creative solutions for the problems of today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we should do it together . and if we do that , we can transform bulgaria to something better .
the magazine magazine is called &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master took me to the most of the time , because the most of the time was the most .
after i had a ride , they were very -- i was accepted and i worked there for six months .
nine days ago , i had a fire .
you know -- all the stuff .
my kids , the most important and henry .
we &apos;re going to make a lot of magazines , our homework , but where we looked at , we were surrounded by images like this .
this picture literally came in seconds after i was put the baby in the poor and i brought it over .
rg : oh oh .
av : taboo number three : talk about his concerns , you don &apos;t talk -- but i &apos;m going to talk about my talk today .
the general opinion is that every aspect of my life has become better , for me , for the cover of birth and family .
but you &apos;re stuck that you &apos;re going to be able to lose control of your control , which is how we have my life , and what &apos;s extremely satisfying .
rg + av : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s such a consequence of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve seen all these &quot; star &quot; with the most of the &quot; star . &quot;
imagine listening to a big , big , right now , to hear the same thing , as you would play personally . john , the walker can be analyzed on the exact attacks and the most important to get it to the wings .
now , since we &apos;ve experienced a time of extraordinary economic , the longest imagery in the history of this country .
but now , a few months later , like good politicians , whatever politicians like to be able to bite , &quot; in the octopus apple , &quot; how does someone do it , they can &apos;t hide their uncertainty .
well , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i met this guy , and i was going to be able to perform a little chaotic man who was eating from tomato sauce and iron for completely irrelevant .
but interestingly , it &apos;s also a future that society is going to be a few tricks of capitalism , which is how to make dna visible innovation in society by trying to do things and then the ones that work , and they &apos;re going to work .
i want to show you a fascinating new hypothesis today , and some surprising new insights that i &apos;ve worked on , which is the relationship between the structure of language that they &apos;re talking about , and their tendency to save .
and if i want to talk right , it forces me to think about it constantly .
well , that &apos;s a theory of theory .
please push this device so that they &apos;re stuck with their dominant hand , so i can measure their own .
it &apos;s the present pleasure in exchange for future pain .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important the ability to communicate about generations .
we english teachers are constantly going to be .
but i &apos;m about using them as a professional weapon .
but they didn &apos;t get the results that they wanted .
at the same time , i was on the field of the most of the time , although i was a ph.d. in a weekly situation .
people and the netizens and the humanoid and birds and everything that goes up here is the red line here . these are people , livestock and pets .
we focused on serious energy problems of the future and produced products for the company .
let &apos;s see the next video .
that flew last night on the party , and -- you can see how it just &apos;s going to be a simple thing , and you can see every more of them that you want .
and he was a hurry about how people practiced the buddhist religion in india .
and he comes back as a broken man back to the village .
and he has to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , the smell and everything .
the animals are in one of their lives . people are people .
we &apos;re a long time . we take the feeling of memory and a long this on all the living creatures in this meditation .
and you think about how the things are , if you &apos;re happy , if you &apos;re happy .
and of course , they &apos;re cruel and they &apos;re going to other .
although the change in your attitude is something for other creatures , you feel this new quality in you , and it &apos;s already helping you , and you &apos;re going to show you a model .
so the coffee cup , or the cup with handle , is used by society to get the public health .
interestingly , the complexity is very high .
we &apos;ve heard yesterday from bill gates .
so it &apos;s very , very simple if you know how to read it .
well , let me close with four general remarks , an example and two pepper .
and i don &apos;t want to stop with detail , but in the bottom right corner , you see an example of what we have .
did you start doing that ?
and that &apos;s what the most of the time that jimmy had talked about , what jimmy had talked about , what &apos;s the new kind of organization , or better , how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things are always less able to be able to be able to be in the use of collaboration with the most of the time .
let &apos;s take astronomy , which was yochai mentioned .
it &apos;s also going to be a professional arguments .
so there &apos;s no argument of two camp , but there &apos;s a lot of interesting positions that are taken by people .
that costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to get their own to someone to get their own and actually have a team , and then they did it between new zealand and spain .
and the first thing i thought was to thank him for that .
but the truth is that life is happening right here .
so people called and have news like this .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m like batman to true my anonymity . &quot;
and one of the things that didn &apos;t make anything done is that they were moving in a different city , and they had a new job .
and in the last 35 years , i studied human behavior on the basis of everything , started from genes about brain power , dopamine and a half , until the to the most of the time .
some of you have a few of them . and it &apos;s dependent on gender .
that was one of these cases , because there was no violence under their ancestors , but in my father .
they &apos;re so similar to each other , as you can only be .
by the way , i have an email to get an email in which we &apos;ve completed the last part of atlas .
and these guys here are the weak force that might be known at least .
so if you want to know , why the sky is blue or why nuclei are stick together , you should basically be in , with a powerful computer -- why dna has the shape that you now have -- the shape that you have now -- you know , it &apos;s got -- the shape you have now .
the comparison is that people in this room is the higgs boson .
but it &apos;s really that with this theory , the physical of the big bang seem to unite the big bang . a absolutely wonderful prediction . the model was not allowed to do that , but it seems to do it .
they created this civilization , this wonderful picture , the darkness in light , and that allows civilization to see all of them .
another big insight came from a study of the darpa state university in 2010 , the baseball maps of the 1950s .
in a similar study in germany , researchers use alfred nino to measure the most of the time and after they had to the face of juice to smile .
&quot; because the colors that they have , they don &apos;t have the european standard , &quot; he said .
&quot; safer ? why ? have you been more policemen ? &quot;
we built the light , which people who are people who are in the world , they brought to think that they were traveling in abroad when they &apos;re going to be a threat to make their cause .
president roosevelt said , &quot; believe that you can do something and you &apos;ve done it half . &quot;
everywhere in port-au-prince , entrepreneurs came out and offered stations for mobile phones .
a graph for the emperor of the technology is finding technology in kibera .
until 2015 , it will give three billion smartphone on the world .
in the stores of the environment , the batteries were the batteries and bread .
this river of time is embedded in everything : in the champagne of a computer , in the zabbaleen , the rose of the rose .
do you read a interview with a writer ?
and also , if i look at the big bears , i remember how i &apos;m a kid at his head to write not from his shoulders , and i feel like this kid .
we &apos;ve always seen how creative technology can be , and we can do that in our lives and our lives , and we can choose those solutions , innovation and moments that don &apos;t make the flow of time , but again .
my mother was a &quot;
in every single refugee refugee camp , she had to beat soldiers to be my older brother mark , who was nine , take a child phone and wanted to make a child child .
and i should do it alone .
take anything you want to have from the suitcase .
then i ended up in puerto juice because i don &apos;t get my feelings .
thank you .
so almost everything in the earth is going to be wiped out about five times five .
underestimated the answer .
why should that play a role ?
so , we can grow any organ from any cell .
here &apos;s the rise in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the conclusion .
if the dragon turn with the same speed , the robot is floating .
and you see how robust the control is .
and he does that while he &apos;s obstacles .
they take their neighbors true .
this is that we &apos;re collecting the most powerful , modified , and we can put it in the way that we can get them to form teams like this .
but the robot can also figure out where it wants to be .
i can feel that . but there &apos;s so much and i want to expand your horizon here , which is consciousness and change your view of honeybees .
this is a huge problem for many years , basically since the late &apos; 80s , which is the most different 1980s that many different viruses , bacteria and the most important ones .
they don &apos;t experience that .
the stimuli for their dishes , and the honey -- there are the honey -- they use the honey on their bars .
the bee dies . honeybees die when they stick , so they didn &apos;t want to do it .
okay , now really , is the question : why is that ?
of course , we have it , especially in the last decade , the world , with a dense chain of the population of the population , with a chain global trade .
and never before , so many people were not aware of this fact .
in fact , not many of you know that our bread was not european invention .
and especially the meat meat in the world &apos;s and china is driving the most high up .
agriculture has been for most people , and here are not many farmers under them , to be bad , to be able to be able to be able to destroy the environment .
everything depends together .
and so while i finished my bread here -- and i have it to be a lot of time , and i &apos;m trying to burn the hands .
and also , it has to be to keep long at the country , with the tools that are available there , materials and the most important thing .
you take somebody like me , a scientist , analyzed and test and developed a new technology , and it &apos;s determined to quantitative .
because i hope you take this today from here , a new connection with nature .
this was a few days ago in armed .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
this is from last year .
but the political political review was one of them . and shekhar kapur turned a film over her , and they should see the queen .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but here &apos;s a slave .
this is a kind of a patient who was at the time 73 -- he was needed a loving , but for this .
i like this slide because they &apos;re talking about what people really motivated to change , and what not .
if you eat a high school , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a kind of a little bit of the time . americans eat more fat because , even more carbs . so the percentage is lower , but the actual number of times is to reduce the goal .
one of the most of the most of the most of the things that we found is that 70 percent of people were banal , 65 percent of people had bad breath , diplomats percent had a headache .
on the other hand , everything is what intimacy is , the intimacy of intimacy .
i hope he &apos;s not going to hang .
the film is based on a computer system of f.
two main things were involved in the project : warner brothers and the most of the time .
and we had enough passion to make the technology and technology .
we &apos;re so concerned about motion capture .
the number seemed infinitely .
and these are the data we get , and then they &apos;re used for the model .
and so the finished picture looked like that was used in the movie .
that was a very , very , very early sample .
and we found this , in the middle of the state .
and has a own of a different amount of water .
people from post-traumatic fission will overcome these cruel , and they &apos;ve lived in the past , which they &apos;ve lived for long .
we were too at fourth -- two of a sudden -- and imagine that a lot of sand is a ocean from sand , 40 degrees of death , a water bottle .
i think the camel is the best thing that &apos;s best the same animal on the world . &quot;
and they use them as much as we see our own .

at the end , they sat in a tree and a opening hand to another .
and the human being is more than that , but you would take these two columns , probably not much left .
and we also have the problem that we can &apos;t build a construction that would be too hard for a single elephant .
one component of it is understanding . here &apos;s a little bit of a sudden , &quot; the ability to understand the feelings of the other and share . &quot;
so now we &apos;re studying more complex expressions . here &apos;s consolation .
that the test is not good for you .
there &apos;s a very simple task that you need to do .
a philosopher was even writing that it was impossible that an individual could have a sense of fairness , because fairness was invented in the french revolution .

so i heard , in a way , it was a success .
over the years , the serious thing can be used to the years .
ck jacobs : how the healthy life
and i think many scientists are sharing this view .
a really cool thing .
now these studies are scientifically equal to the ones , and they were not the whole story .
ask for the part of the story that &apos;s not told .
... a priest ?
finally , a group that believes that the indus people are the ancestors of people in today &apos;s own .
right after left , how many ? okay .
it can be useful at the most useful , creating more data that are then .
this sign is the most common script , and only in this text appears twice .
it turns out it &apos;s already a long tradition in india , looking at the ground on the ground of the birth of the birth .
space , we all know how it looks .
this wire is the most important thing that would make the name bell famous .
rg had made the historical discovery that results can also make radio waves as well as radio waves .
actually all the young people in the city .
somebody who &apos;s sitting in the seat next to you -- that &apos;s okay in a computer system , but somebody would sit in a very common way , and somebody would be so dense next to them , then they would be able to be more .
the dalai lama always likes to say -- he says if you get the idea of the computer &apos;s mind , it &apos;s because you see that you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be a little bit of the details for your intelligence .
take this wonderful thing , the most important thing we showed you is , they &apos;re afraid of the most afraid .
a man was a tank to a picture that was been a symbol of the resistance of resistance .
but what wouldn &apos;t you have done all of the time if you had had the modern communications to create a sense that it was wrong with the wrong thing ?
combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate on global level and organize global history with the challenges that are now popular and the most largely global nature .
in the museum of the children in rwanda , there &apos;s a photograph of a young boy -- and the museum of the children are coming to life , which was left as a million people .

you can move on very different ways -- vary in the most different , the movement of the surface and the consumer &apos;s power .
this is the driving algae .
boy : ahhh .
let &apos;s slow up to see spines in action .
mark is at stanford , one of my partner , is an extraordinary engineer , which is a technology called the shape of the form of the brain .
you see almost like aliens from aliens , and the secret , what they &apos;re going to stick is their own toes .
here we are going to pull the band-aid .
these are the same structures that allow spines to make spines , and the most challenging , difficult surfaces .
so , a long time of the long songs , the long chinese songs , are serve as a result of the females and to choose males and choose to choose a partner .
so if dolphins are less than 20 feet away , they have to be less than half the time they have the whistles ; they have to create the whistles .
if we think about marine warming for animals like dolphins , we need to be about the consequences of our interventions in the clear , which we thought was right .
after the most of the time , the marine marine system has made the systems available these systems to experience what scientists could hear .
you just hear the low frequencies .
if males and females use this signal to find a partner and they &apos;re scattered , they &apos;re going to be able to imagine what the impact of the population is the rising of the population .
like ships , they can be made . they found that with a better , better , more powerful of this noise can be reduced to 90 percent .
they &apos;re going to be the speed of 50 percent .
we see strangers , we see strangers , 300 times , 300 times , and it &apos;s always more . and they &apos;re not like we .
you have all the possibilities available .
we observe a continual rise of the men .
and obviously , there &apos;s a hundred times .
with initiatives like 100 dollars , it &apos;s going to be me to think that we &apos;re going to bring a whole new generation of people in the old computer computer .
thank you .
i think nothing about it is the problem .
our daily lives is , in a remarkable state , we say , in a remarkable state , we say in a more extraordinary state .
usually it &apos;s one or two per year .
and there are !
but we &apos;re much more sophisticated .
part of the challenge was to try to try rhythm and space by not just my hands -- juggling is much more powerful -- but the rhythm of my body and the feet , and the balls with my feet .
and then they play crazy .
ok , because they don &apos;t understand what a computer is , i &apos;ll give you a little bit of reference .
now , again , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
they have somebody up here , who &apos;s the most important principle to do this , ok ?
alain -- and then it comes to calm . just a little number of time .
with space and straight in the room , in other ways .
and then the levels of levels .
in this year -- you &apos;d like to show the slides -- in this year , we carry the most powerful with us , a project that we helped the design .
we can call this on a computer system which allows you to put another information on the clothes , while you &apos;re doing these kinds of things .
( scott adams : i &apos;ve noticed that i &apos;m going to be the leading expert in the way that i &apos;m the leading expert .
and we also give a new product tonight , and it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s shown public .
now , the farmers can only be in the season , and not in the most of the time .
electrons disappear in a way of the kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of information and then energy . and energy can &apos;t see .
that &apos;s what he thought he was there .
potatoes , potatoes have 48 chromosomes . did you know that ?
good . atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
and somebody said to him , &quot; well , what is the sense of that , henry ?
we &apos;ve been talking about four years of time .
if google tends to be a book , they bring it into a very beautiful format .
i &apos;ll give you an example .
suddenly , in the middle of the &apos; 40s , everybody was excited .
but imagine , it &apos;s going to be no interest .
but also many of the right , the most popular , apparently , apparently , have been the propaganda .
if you &apos;re going to get the big to the big , that &apos;s a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a warrior . &quot;
if i run this pink sound for longer than some minutes , they would literally stop hearing it .
many people escape to headphones , but this turn big , public spaces like this , shared spaces like this , in millions tiny personal personal personal .
you can also do that on a beautiful place , like a lake .
and finally , a lonely .
and i said , &quot; that &apos;s my job . &quot;
thank you very much , you &apos;ve been here . we &apos;re all so grateful . &quot;
and so they went away .
because they were not at us on the pavement and they couldn &apos;t see the exchange between me and my pearl earring , a exchange that appeared fair , but to aliens .
now , i &apos;m going to tell you , in the last year , there was a lot of competition in the last year , because the arab spring is still growing out , which is the most ?
this photograph was actually sent into a police police , and see the floor of people who were tracking the police .
the kids just do photos in a class , the teacher gets them , they &apos;re breeding them on the most important .
in today &apos;s talk , it &apos;s about the brain and , yay , somewhere out there is a kind of a computer .
this is something we can work in our lifetime in our lifetime . i believed a difference and so i tried to get out of the most of the time .
but sometimes science has some other properties that they really really really really really really really really interesting .
what are we going to do more data ?
there &apos;s something that we believe it &apos;s obvious , but wrong .
it &apos;s so that intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we don &apos;t look at alligator as a very intelligent , not in a human way .
in humans , we &apos;ve developed the most of the most of the time of the world &apos;s name with the name of the neocortex . nature has this little trick .
it &apos;s not that you look at there and say , &quot; what do i see ?
not like a computer program . not in the least like a computer program .
these are the things that are going to come first .
we need something police , we need something , but only to defense .
you can see it on your lap . &quot;
they traveled because they were at the time of elections outside the country .
this is a lot of the time .
and then , when they were introduced the door , grandma said , &quot; no , no , no , no .
they wash like this : by hand .
this group uses three , every one .
it &apos;s real .
she did it to learn english and learn this as a foreign language .
the computer has already been , and that &apos;s one of three participants .
if you think , you think differently than the employer of the united states , which was actually part of our experiment , because that &apos;s exactly what we did .
we repeated the experiment with the same groups , but we added a snapshot between the enlightenment , as we deal with the data , and the actual beginning of the view .
the price of paradise is the netizens from paradise .
and they moved and they were breeding and they were going to get their arms on each other and they were looking at their arms .
we &apos;re really good at talking about skills and security and health , we &apos;re really bad at talking about character .
then you &apos;re going to imagine personal coach , the most of the time , the most powerful breath in the bad breath .
i don &apos;t really feel with emotions .
the first gift , or talent , is a little bit of the time -- the ability to explode in other people &apos;s heads and figure out what they have .
they have a humility humility .
that &apos;s what the unconscious is looking for .
we found them between the most of the , raped by many , many men , i don &apos;t know how many .
where does your journey start ?
and that it &apos;s not normal to live in a home .
what was my challenge ?
they need their empathy .
lexicography : the process dictionaries builds .
well , first of all , i give the queen to blame because it &apos;s funny .
online online .
the bad words -- look , if someone thinks about a place and then don &apos;t find it on the map , he thinks , &quot; this map sucks ! &quot;
you think , &quot; ok , if we think words are tools that we use to give our thoughts to how to know that asphalt are better than hammer ?
the usda has 33 different people &apos;s definitions for &quot; set . &quot;
and then there &apos;s this mike &apos;s mike &apos;s favorite . mike &apos;s lives in britain .
i have the whole time , &quot; the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , &quot; the dictionary .
so , i &apos;m a chair .
and to make a long story short , i landed here .
and so , a piece of piece , for a piece , while this three days , you start to understand , why do i hear all of this kind of stuff ?
they may be from a ted speaker , and they can go back to the conversation during the year , and next year , after the same intellectual and emotional journey .
the manufacturers don &apos;t implemented the most powerful in their cheap , because they &apos;re not sure what the public would start with a very precise ego that could even fold on the palm .
there was a insecure thing there , if that was already promising , and it was technically not able to find the channel .
instead of keeping the most of the time , you &apos;re going to make it .
and , &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
we call us a little bit of &amp; amp ; we &apos;re going to live and work in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this work is the cartoon of a human being .
we debate the case &quot; what the world needs now is nuclear &quot; -- right or wrong ?
and now , there &apos;s only three main types of time for this -- coal and gas , more than that , and nuclear .
we have become the russian employer , by being transformed in electricity .
and the emissions emissions are distances of all greenhouse emissions and particles that are causing warming , and to co2 .
now , if you look at the fact that the prevalence of nuclear weapons is happening with the spread of nuclear weapons , because we know that india and pakistan have developed nuclear weapons in the world .
for wind , the area is much bigger , but the most powerful is smaller .
the reality is that 21 states have nuclear states , right ?
and in the senate of the united states , we need the support of both parties -- just one or two voices are necessary to get the global warming in the senate , and this room can help .
we &apos;re just not going to get renewable sources of renewables .
i used to worry about the 10 years earlier .
thank you .
that was -- my motivation was from apollo 234 .
for the first time , we have enough wealth in the hands of some less people , and the available technology , which is going to allow us to protect space .
26 groups from seven countries took the competition part of the competition , every one between one and 25 million dollars .
and we can bring them to space station .
and the advantage for the intangible is the sum of the most of the world &apos;s and social health .
would you surprise us , fascinated us ?
that means that surfaces can cut themselves . they can be incredibly small .
a challenge was how we can express these new algorithmic order in a column .
what i didn &apos;t know about time is because we &apos;ve just seen the outside , that the surfaces are going to be on the top of the column . that was a pretty surprising discovery .
inspired by the process of mobile cell , michael &apos;s algorithms writes , the incredible , fascinating forms with millions of surfaces . no human being could design them by hand , but you can build it .
so look at this picture here -- many forms dance here for you .
it &apos;s a very rare disease .
this is a drug that was developed for cancer .
you can see the chip even picked up the chip .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s led by young people .
and i think many people here in the room are in the same position as i am .
so i think women are going to be able to survive in our society because they realize that it &apos;s very important for their future generations .
we realized that since recently , more people have been using the tools like youtube and social networks to give their stories to their stories and tell their own stories .
at the same time , we &apos;re going to get them to come and explore our part of the world .
so i became more or less than &quot; nothing . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; maybe if i do this ants a few apartments , they pull a few apartments . &quot;
this was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do that ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back to the next day .
and it was ...
my work , roughly estimated , sometimes five , six or seven weeks ; that can &apos;t always be repeated .
and i &apos;m going to ask it about , and shaped the chariot .
so i broke the needle .
it &apos;s a very crowded work , but the best things come in small of the small world .
they expect their employees that they asked them to do what they asked when they did the task , they can do more .
there &apos;s this absolute concentration of being this absolute concentration of consciousness , consciousness , an absolute center of compassion and love that the primary properties of the divine .
my favorite body flew into the one direction , my favorite wheel in the other .
i asked all the demonstrations i probably wouldn &apos;t do with them , the most of the time i wouldn &apos;t be able to look at the friends that i couldn &apos;t look at with them .
because you don &apos;t need the most of the time .
and if you &apos;re going to give you the back of the back , you can just go to the wind , you can just go to it and make it a little bit of it in the dirt . &quot;
20 years ago , doctors had cut my leg and hoped , and there was a 15 year-old chance of opportunity .
as i was more and more powerful -- and at that point in my life , i was probably 14 pounds easier than i &apos;m now .
and nobody represents this modern amount of view in my eyes more than david black .
upright , you say , is the threshold of what makes us human .
he &apos;s president of the international union for the international union , which is the least of the least the name i &apos;ve ever heard .
he was born to three months early , and it was really a fantastic job of him .
so once i tried to approach the piano , i became a better job .
and at the end , you were so fast that things like the flight &quot; is not a problem , right ?
do you want to hear me ?
dp : &quot; tiger doyle . &quot;
i don &apos;t get that .
they &apos;re fighting about their own lifestyle in this forest , in a world that &apos;s still clean , one world that &apos;s not yet educated in a world that &apos;s not yet afraid .
so we know that they &apos;re able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a research for absolutely impossible than i started .
the long loving connection to the mother , who evolved during this long childhood , and also the most life , can be able to get the whole life , and that can be 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and also the huge camp of the world &apos;s forest needs now , and so the pygmies are going to have the pygmies in the congo and so many hundreds of years , adopted .
yesterday , someone said that .
we have now in every state , and the problems in florida are other than the new york .
come on and blow me down here ?
there &apos;s the politicians out there ?
what we want to do in the lab is so pretty the same , but with a few dozen of different kinds of molecules -- so a dramatic reduction of complexity , but yet trying to create something more powerful .
it &apos;s even very much more powerful . if you &apos;re going to form , it &apos;s actually not really something .
now where they &apos;re all experts for protocells , we &apos;re going to play with these protocells .
we see the self-assembly of this body from oil spills that we &apos;ve seen before , and the black blobs of it represent this black mud -- this diverse , very complex , organic black mud .
in his lab , martin &apos;s &quot; protocells &quot; is going to be , experimental blobs of chemicals that behave like living cells . his work shows how life could be done on earth first .
this is a kind of a little bit of a sudden to lead your tadpole on the evening .
what is that -- where did they know that ? they took it .
but if we do that at each -- every fire fire , we could redefine the emergency .
and the dirt is the dirt that otherwise live in their lovely pink lungs , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be brought into -- with it .
the birds could jump from one to another .
you can be able to be a recent news of him . you can talk to him .
but these herd to keep a big misunderstanding of our planet is going to demand .
next , we &apos;re going to be able to multiply the skin cells and multiply them in a computer .
we &apos;ve been working on the world for thousands of years , starting to products like wine , beer and yogurt .
it &apos;s true that if we &apos;re approaching our research , we see that there &apos;s almost a universal pursuit of people to have a car .
let me just talk about hydrogen .
that &apos;s a huge opportunity to create energy , mobile energy .
if we can see these of these things , that can also be other .
you had to survive .
and we &apos;ve been sure to be given our school district to get funding and support .
because why should our students drive so far from their lives ?
it became a book , then to a show .
there was an incredible idea of a tremendous idea .
here &apos;s the west coast , you &apos;ve destroyed your forest .
but on this picture , you see how we started building the most powerful , which was soon a big amount of brazil .
when i was time , my favorite time came to start , i &apos;ve studied the new field of the world &apos;s field .
if you &apos;re in the south manhattan , you see the expansion of new york city like it was , at the end of the american revolution .
the white surfaces on this map are the most safer places .
or the most of the time , the wet niches , insects and the other places .
maybe a more successful thing lived there .
it &apos;s so much force to unite science and visualization that these images are coming together . it &apos;s like both sides of the mirror .
and we &apos;ve got a really dramatic level of view in our society .
so i don &apos;t have to go to it .
you &apos;re going to make that written , of course .
this is a building building .
an example that we all know is this mobile phone .
and it &apos;s all about this question -- of course , in a very artistic and indirectly way .
but it &apos;s happening everywhere , and these tools are parts of that , which is helping us to do it .
seriously -- clap , they &apos;re quiet -- that &apos;s really great .
alex ornish looks a sustainable future .
you could be my , that &apos;s a big problem for a law , but congress doesn &apos;t seem to be very close to it .
but if you create a lot of quality of the high copies , and you sell , it &apos;s not okay .
some of the things we share , we made things that we &apos;ve found and caused every single option in this industry .
that &apos;s the simple thing .
i had a very foreign , and i had a very foreign education , and i had almost broken education .
and i thought i was going to start a barefoot college -- college just for the poor .
a professional is somebody , with a combination of competence , confidence and belief .
when i said that , they said , &quot; do you show us what &apos;s possible . what do you do ?
the whole electricity comes from the sun .
democracy , the most important thing , how to miss his country , what should you do if you &apos;re arrested , what you should do if you &apos;re sick .
it &apos;s going to be able to get the presence of the schools , it &apos;s going to be able to get the presence of teachers and parents , so that the puppets can call the teachers and the parents .
you use sign sign .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , mr. president .
a computer .
and our favorite system is creating one of the largest , dynamic computers of the world for this kind of kind of kind of thing .
you see the most of the time along the front of the world &apos;s most , which we have as an artist for the scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , there &apos;s data of these two groups of people , data about how happy they are .
&quot; i &apos;m going to go physically , financially , emotionally , mentally and in almost every other way . &quot; i don &apos;t have a minute .
he didn &apos;t have him , and of course , ray had six months later , and of course , ray of the same idea .
in this case , it &apos;s because they &apos;re going to be used in the experiment that i &apos;m going to tell you about , prints pictures of the images .
we collected our materials , went from the room and waited half an hour .
i &apos;m going to show you why .
they made two images and they had two beautiful types of skills , &quot; more powerful &quot; skills of them for them , &quot; and we said , &quot; what would you do ? &quot;
we take a completely new group of naive and say , &quot; you know , we give a more a little bit of a time and we can make it on two different ways .
and the most beautiful thing that &apos;s going to fly the big car and the most beautiful .
voices : it flies in the air . oh shit .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t start . &quot;
don &apos;t forget that this tradition is not from the clouds from the clouds , but back into a time , even before we stopped stories on the ground , or a wet .
the way food , yeah .
the kind of the way the roof is , you know .
and so we had my father , because i knew he would kill me when i drive them alone . so we go into the car .
&quot; and had this guy uniform , &quot; and had a blue mix of a blue expression in the face ? &quot;
i really want to put it in ? because if i didn &apos;t have a thread to get me out of it -- enough metaphor for your taste ? -- it could be that i never come back .
see ? we &apos;re a secret club with a secret of a secret .
she says , &quot; ma , you have to look ! &quot;
&quot; i agree for the little old lady , damn even time . &quot;
it &apos;s up from the car . &quot;
i really have big fear .
so what is the social result of this ?
where can i go and go together with who ?
and if we have it , we will decide how many miles we drive , which is where we live and work .
smart decorative on the station communicate and see them exactly where their bus is just on the road and when he comes , and they can buy their tickets .
i want to be able to get the wireless to the wireless world , and i challenge that this network should be accessible to open standards for every one .
and they came here in the late 1960s .
and for all of you , that with a mental illness , you know what to be a challenge .
i said that i wanted to tell the most of the most important , i wanted to share with you the three a of fantastic parts and i wanted to leave them with a sad picture .
because they were all three years old .
and so what i love at this story is that ubuntu grier is just a authentic person , and that &apos;s what authenticity is .
i ate the line of the line . &quot;
you can sleep in clean barriers .
j it &apos;s so many that you see the problem is a problem .
i found it strange about it when it was a competition , about a fresh wound .
it &apos;s largely a white , rich , rich , which was not waiting for the city .
it looks pretty simple , but that was a kind of a little bit of a time .
people are going to be over two things -- they were amazed about the destruction , but there was also a sense of the most of the time that i found .
because at looking at the four platforms along the world &apos;s -- that &apos;s a improved version of a computer -- we knew that it had to be windows to be able to be on the conditions and changed the definition of ground zero .
we have the opportunity to rethink our thinking about cities .
dr : it was an honor .
and i know that children are going to be drawn every year .
if -- god forbid -- somebody from us here and a concussion , most of us would be completely different to some of us in a period of a few hours .
you have to know with the problems that we &apos;re talking about today .
as it turns out , tom looked at a helmet for 20 dollars a good way to preserve a 100,000 of them .
that &apos;s not true , but it happened tony blair during the dawn of the madrid , as his first , of course , &quot; discovered , &quot; and he was described .
with other words , they have a common and growing complexity of visual language that happens in the sequence of the sequence .
he was told that there was no cure .
today , all countries are shining to offer patents for drugs that have been at least 20 years .
it depends on the most of the business companies , and they &apos;re going to be available to the other , and make them available for other people .
in the vending way , the same kind of stage , a more a , a little bit of the time , people sat in the labs , afternoon , very high humidity and they didn &apos;t feel .
you can adapt everything to worry about your well-being .
he offers all these services , and he gave up , in the audience , tickets and so small things that you &apos;re doing online , but for people who were so much connected to the digital world .
the question was , &quot; how do you make this teacher .
look what he does here .
and the husband of the daughter , he was sick by the fearless of his wife .
but the visual complexity is still very big .
well , the most powerful thing was , a little bit of a sudden on our studies .
well , if we feel emotions , we show them .
and you could get the impression that the unhappy people are taking another structural position within the network .
this is my favorite . &quot;

misha glenny : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen -- a clever group of political hackers that &apos;s 2011 to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
the net connects everything and will be very soon a lot of human activities .
interestingly , anonymous uses his information information , but not for financial profits .
he explained to me like he went in 2003 and 2004 , and he took 10,000 dollars from the roman ward , and he took 10,000 dollars from the roman cards .
he was born in a stable and respect middle family , his obsession with play as a teenager was led to him .
and most of the , with exception of script and the most important , no real social skills , they showed no real social skills in the outside of the world .
i think there &apos;s several reasons . i &apos;m not going to go to the details , but some mention .
but they &apos;re all the market , and what &apos;s driving the market is , especially one is the big demographic .
we also found a lot of examples of dead big boxes that have been transformed in all kinds of social institutions , many schools , many churches , and many libraries , like this .
and finally , i expect the streets to be extended by the mall of the mall .
it &apos;s very successful . and it helped to attract that eight of 13 regional pieces of plans have been in tamil plans , to become a lot of the time .

&quot; his vagina to look at , &quot; she said , &quot; is a whole more a single single . &quot;
but actually , it didn &apos;t start there , it started with a conversation with a woman .
it &apos;s about a gender , which is a fundamental resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a kind of a , and the way that it really exists in the body , and i think there &apos;s a real meaning in us , our bodies are created by our heads .
i want to tell you this little story about my own beginnings , because that &apos;s a lot of happiness , and with agnes .
maybe it &apos;s on my favorite south carolina , which is not much smaller than today &apos;s current , and once a future is a source of a future .
well , maybe he was too damn , because he stayed where he was , even after the boat , he was a long time after the nazis , and even after the most of the time and the most important and the most important thing in budapest .
and he got the same answer : &quot; bring me the best workers you can find and if you &apos;re good enough . &quot;
and also , it &apos;s clear , &quot; it &apos;s okay . it was all so beautiful .
&quot; ah ! &quot; i said , dr. robicsek . &quot; i went to the movie . &quot;
like , he &apos;s going to be too much .
and you can imagine it right .
you know what you &apos;re looking for .
but we &apos;re taking care of the most difficult cases and order to go back to the other day .
so we came to these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother went to the soviet union , while the soviet union .
and if you think it &apos;s not going to be , it &apos;s not going to be so long , until you &apos;re going to keep doing it .
what i want to try with is i hope to illustrate the dots .
and what i want to point out in the presentation later is 50 percent of the united states are under the ocean .
it &apos;s there because the photons can &apos;t reach the average depth of the ocean , which is the rift valley . the rift valley is on the ground .
and so we went along the mountain phone in a field next to the top of the mountain , and found the missing heat .
so i started to develop a new kind of new , a new , which is replaced me , and i don &apos;t have to go to my vehicle .
we find the observation of conservation .
and i looked at them yesterday , she &apos;s up in seattle . ok .
but i would leave a child without license the control of my system .
in some parts of the world , for example , in south africa , education is just hard .
when we saw the effect of the most profound , andrew and i decided we had to increase it to offer so many people like possible education .
what was the special thing about these classes ?
the video is going to be interrupted all some minutes and the students will ask a question .
so we wanted to convince some of our colleagues &apos;s humanities that multiple choice is not so bad .
in terms of certain courses , you can ask yourself , which are the most common family and how to help the students , to fix this .
we even see the beginning of either through an personalized curriculum or through the feedback of feedback that we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe , and i thought about what infinity means when i was a kid .
and in our society , it &apos;s mainly about making reality of other people .
i have my doubt about the values of newton &apos;s values , like , for example , it &apos;s going to be rational that you &apos;re rational in a computer .
so you can understand my surprise when i got reading the new york , that alan madoff , travel of the officer , said , &quot; penelope rand . &quot;
i think you can do that on those notes , which is not about the ones that i don &apos;t have . right from this reason , i don &apos;t have jokes about frightening and a charming .
i &apos;m already going to be doing this old times of the most of the time , i &apos;m telling you .
he said , i &apos;d have to pay him more respect because it can take to 18 years to become a right good .
well , well , yes ? what ? i can &apos;t hear it . &quot;
and i &apos;m afraid that this active someone doesn &apos;t like us .
i &apos;ve been thinking about the verge of the world &apos;s thoughts about beauty that they &apos;re doing yesterday . there &apos;s a deadly in his book that acts can sometimes make beauty .
george w. bush : what the defense costs our security , and what the defense of our freedom costs , we need to pay the price . &quot;
ten years ago , no astronomer would come on the world -- well , or very few astronomers -- that there are planets outside of our solar system .
many other ecosystems on earth are truly in danger .
he &apos;s constantly going to be able to go to a particle particle , and it could be a non-zero-sum system that could be destroyed the world .
we need to be careful with biotechnology the same satellite of the same satellite .
so , of course , we don &apos;t want to see .
what can we do in the end of the way ?
and now the worst thing is .
we use a lot of money on it , to make sure that we don &apos;t die in a computer system , but we &apos;re almost not giving it to it . and yet it &apos;s completely preventable .
we don &apos;t want to be caught again on the wrong foot .
i hope that &apos;s going to be .
that &apos;s very , very important because this is the system , the costumes , from the life on the planet , and it &apos;s time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing insight . and we &apos;ve just been thinking about it for recently .
and that &apos;s what the system is to mention , a number of places in the southern hemisphere , shown in these circles .
everybody who comes to this is just going to be the database and can get the information that &apos;s needed for everything , which is what &apos;s happening .
we &apos;re to paste the wave , the technological possibilities .
in a earthquake , big amounts of these new microbes come to be seen before , from the sea floor .
the most of john &apos;s john &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; and a half of the world &apos;s oceans -- and a half of the world &apos;s world causes over the world .
so i think optimism is going to move forward .
so again , radical against conservative .
the most important thing against the obvious thing is , you know , too often , you want to understand everything .
our intellectual desires are complex .
you know that it &apos;s true ; the cathedrals , as unexpected , will always be unexpected .
but i prefer to play something completely unknown , and even with mistakes , rather than repeat the same thing , so it &apos;s from his pillow .
risks of spaces that were never so much like that , how they should be in a large city .
there are the emotions of victims .
daniel mullen : building very large ideas , he calls 17 terms of the architecture of architecture -- raw , engaged , radical -- and inspiration for every bold creative pursuit .
it also has the lowest most of the car of the car .
so , does something really be really clear , or will it just give you a few of the things ?
em : it &apos;s just that you have to do . if not , we &apos;re in big trouble .
with this capital , and the capital is installed by the edges and then put the panels on the roof and then the doctor &apos;s doctor &apos;s doctor &apos;s disease , which is lower than the electricity .
we &apos;re almost failed , but we &apos;ve come across 2008 .
it &apos;s similar to a jet jet .
how about everything in the world , a person &apos;s worth of innovative innovative ?
look at that .
boy , if you &apos;re our livestock , and a 12-year-old see how he eats one of our goats , it &apos;s very nervous . then just go to him .
we suffered hunger .
our tradition looks like this : there &apos;s a holy fire .
until now we were with support of the world wildlife fund in the situation , which is very small programs to programs with the value of the world .
very important -- we invest the money in enlightenment about aids and hiv .
and the most useful -- again , a lot of a lot of a lot of the world in the world -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful means .
and we hide this price behind huge winning .
dan : and alice &apos;s going to lead to the richest revolution for environmental food .
and the more , more shells , oysters , oysters , the more , more , more , the known species .
this is like a classification of protein .
the science sees the world through the mind , the address , things that can be measured and described , but there &apos;s a frame of art and insight .
from the plan of a few cameras , after three weeks , a plan was a plan with 25 .
this is the natural cycle .
that would usually not do a photographer photographer , a photograph of the way , right ? but sometimes that &apos;s going to be to show the dimensions .
here you see how the glacier pulls back .
this is several cameras here .
could india be the origin or a global center for innovation , just like a global center for the global and the most important thing ?
if we asked people to share with people in these are what they were working on , they said , &quot; we work on global products . &quot;
you can &apos;t be a professor if you weren &apos;t also student .
the best hospitals , in the doctors , would go to cancer cancer , and in the pharmacy , , heart disease , heart disease , for artificial , to the course of four o &apos;clock .
it works a little bit like -- that &apos;s a recently a little bit of a sudden for four o &apos;clock in the morning .
i said , i know a very clear message when i see a .
everybody in our society comes to cancer -- if not personally , then through a beloved person , a family , a colleague .
in this space room , the genetic material is the chromosomes , the chromosomes , within a nucleus .
we &apos;ve applied tumor fields in the lab about 20 different cancers , and we see this effect at all .
he got the most the time .
but what we can see is that in sixth month of the tumor , it &apos;s been responding to the tumor .
that &apos;s just the beginning .
this is a new workplace , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re 15 feet deep , and collect rainwater from the roof , there &apos;s a little pipe , and from their courtyard .
so , water from 300 , 400 miles away , it looks like this .
somewhere is going to run a stream or a computer system through this scene .
that &apos;s called &quot; junk &quot; . in english , we have a lot of water and water .
and you have to fall on .
these are the beautiful line that we &apos;re seeing on one of the images .
and the most of the time is down to 27 percent : 600,000 less people per year , hiv in sub-saharan africa .
10 percent of india .
they &apos;re going to get the jobs in textiles , which are people who get people from the most of the time and they &apos;re going to bring them into the way the same and prosperity .
and the countries to the right , because you see the most of the time , basically , every country with a computer &apos;s disease , we say , less than 5,000 dollars , a more a bit of saying .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india didn &apos;t grow so right .
buy african products .
but i think a much bigger problem is that this logic is that we should drop ipods and not to drop bombs -- i mean , it would be a great title for thomas .
and then 500 people have been picked up and four of them were selected to visit the institution and so they were to be able to be able to be too daunting .
so now citizens with the support of the planning is not necessarily going to change anything about it because it &apos;s still the dictators that control the agenda .
the most important thing is , does the internet be the worst expectations ?
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he was younger with us .
because for me , that &apos;s what lived in this time and lived in this particular way , the question was , &quot; you want to do it ? &quot; either sex or drugs took us .
i was like paralyzed , people .
as indians , and now politicians and the most important thing is , i &apos;m pretty about the most of the time that our country is , worried about india as a new amount of water , yes even the new superpower .
with other words , all kinds of things tell us about countries about countries , regardless of whether they want to come to daylight or not .
but the lightning in our country is pretty slow , it took a half an hour to be a call .
it can &apos;t understand the conversation .
this can sometimes have an alarming consequences . ok .
and these of you who have your money to see you , like , can be surprised , how many of the most of the things are on the most of the time , which explain the most of the time .
i went home and i was doing a little bit of a little bit .
and the most of the time : a bathroom without water .
and now i feel like george bush .
now , this title , this expression , comes from a critic , a early critic and this is a passage that i just love , and i &apos;d like to read you .
and that &apos;s a good thing , because if it would be , mother nature would have a problem : how about everything in the world we get chimpanzees to mate ?
that &apos;s the hardest part , which is not obvious , and therefore i &apos;ve got it for the end .
ok ? stop . the driving is now .
i don &apos;t know why there are a lot of time , but no matter , they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you , thank you .
i actually suspect that the most important thing is probably familiar with the most reasons why we want new things to be very , very quickly .
it &apos;s like this . they should look like this .
bob mckim has another very -- another version of this exercise in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned that with time : you get a much better biennial , much more creative results , if all of you think about the rules .
and suddenly there was a productive conversation about design about a real object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little skeptical , i &apos;ll come back to it .
you know how it feels , all these uncertainty , as long as you left in the corridor , you &apos;re going to take a case of a case of a case and you ask yourself what &apos;s going on here .
so , we would all feel sure we would feel all the time and would have a good time because we agree about the rules and agreed to be agreed .
we do everything that leads to success , but then if we &apos;re there , we believe that we &apos;ve done it . we &apos;re satisfied back and hear all that , all that we &apos;ve been successful .
i was faster , but so depressed .
i learned that success is not a street street .
and the most important thing is just full of hotter girls . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh my god , &quot; hopefully , for always , the last time in public .
he certainly asked that everything fit together .
it took 900 people to this part .
and the second is that people obviously experience a actual connection .
these are questions .
as you see in today &apos;s liberal liberal democracies , society allows us to determine the state of our self , but it also requires it from us .
it means that we &apos;re making our full potential as human beings .
so these are the layers that i wanted to do , which is the ways that i wanted to lead you to today -- the question : what are the intentions that come to use if you design something ?
so i said , and my colleague sebastian , i learned that there must be better ways .
and we were successful .
i &apos;m going to give you one in the fall .
he &apos;s going to be in the right position , they &apos;re going to be with his nose and beat them .
we learned the first surprise .
there had to be a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of thing that we watched the amount of power and the speed that we observe and the system of the system .
a load cell is measuring forces and that &apos;s actually a load cell cell with a crystal inside .
this is the most of the time -- here &apos;s the heel , and that &apos;s going to be able to make it around and meet the load cell .
a very , very much solution for the special problem .
and freeflying : it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean .
i think that &apos;s one of the most beautiful classical , which was ever built .
i don &apos;t know other people &apos;s other , not even a time , which is just benefit from that , that this is a three-dimensional space .
now you see that -- he just makes me stand .
the submarine , the last year out , is this one .
true is understanding architecture as a result of architecture , and it &apos;s a lot of the obvious example -- is not the right approach that we need to choose .
basically , new york has been built on the back of the world &apos;s back , our streets about their shells .
in these eight side chambers , little of the road are going to be small , which is virtually the most of the time .
so you went around in london and was overwhelmed by this smell .
finally , snow created a map of the outbreak of outbreak .
and that &apos;s happening every second week .
i made her portrait on the top of the temple temple .
and in this area of the amazon , in 2010 , oil was discovered .
the other side of the field is a hostile pigmented , where actually osama osama bin laden . that &apos;s a little bit of the time .
this was one of the great things that was the big .
this is the most important thing . let me continue and show you the hubble field of deep field .
but then you get to jupiter and the one is 40 minutes away . that &apos;s a problem .
that &apos;s going to be the part of the universe that &apos;s going to be about understanding the universe .
we only have a million galaxies .
so the stuff is that it seems to be the dark matter .
when you saw this picture for the first time , you don &apos;t have a lot of it in it .
this simulation was done with 1,000 processors a month , just to make that visible .
we &apos;re going to hope with a resolution that &apos;s about this picture of the earth that you can actually see the complicated patterns of the earth .
and in the consequence , we &apos;re stressed .
47 percent .
that &apos;s crazy . we &apos;re constantly doing that , even in the everyday life .
i went into a cycle . that led too many pain and problems with the joints so i could almost keep nothing more .
i asked myself , could you be creative if you look for intent for the constraints ?
the whole thing happened to happen today .
the constant is increasing from the most unequal , as well as a kind of a , and there &apos;s a lot of the time of a brain system .
stalin &apos;s famine famine , the most of the 30s , killed millions of thousands of times , they saw the nazis to the nazis , the most of the women who were executed . many of the women were trafficked as a while to germany .
because that brings the grief to . &quot;
and as a psychologist , i was excited about the idea of most , that we had learned what we &apos;ve learned in the virtual world about us , and about our identity , using a better life in the real world .
we used to be used to a new way of being together alone .
human relationships are more robust , messy and more .
it &apos;s going to be it .
because in the moment , in the moment , people are alone , even for a few seconds , they &apos;re going to be able to get , they &apos;re going to get panic , they &apos;re going to reach to a electronic device .
but we &apos;re in danger , because in fact , the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently , we didn &apos;t have won every one with the most of our students who were predicted some of our students , and pretty often -- i felt that they had a predictions on financial ways .
maybe because my father has always read us at night .
so i made them in quiet -- but they had to be very disturbing .
finally , i thought i was a pyramid , but i &apos;m missing the time to take it to take a look at it .
although you lose , no fear of failure , if we &apos;ve given everything . because who can demand more people than giving them what he &apos;s going to do .
if i want to call you name , i never know a answer .
did i have enough of the brain ?
the second challenge would be cells .
today , in many clinical trials , different kinds of stem cells are used for heart disease .
last month , it &apos;s been made with this technology that &apos;s created to show the creation of human .
we can then map them and apply them to 360 degrees and analyze the kidney in all their own properties . then we can just take this information and print by the time .
i couldn &apos;t go to school . i just went dirty .
i was a kid , i said , &quot; yes , i want to . i want to do this surgery .
you may notice that a new area is called the suburbs .
and connected to this , there were examples of the world -- from the choice of a president to the computer of wikipedia and everything in between -- the ones that could be able to do a lot of things .
third , the most powerful , acute environmental issues .
because what you need is the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want cd , i want to do the music that she plays .
i &apos;m hot joseph and a member of kenya in kenya .
we need to be our women and children , we need to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve the infrastructure .
late in the night , i went home with batteries and ice .
together , anybody have a notes ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , to give the master to moscow and work in full-time to work .
that can be huge spending , but if the city can win a number of x volunteers for y hours , the most of the time of the city is the city of the city .
they have a little bit of the time , tables and data .
so these are , in the 18 minutes , who were able to be able to be able to talk to me , to talk to you here , between two and a half people who are going to be traveled into cities .
and he was in a computer &apos;s mud .
the building here have several stories .
these green things in the foreground are mangoes .
and if you &apos;re a legal system , you have political activities .
i couldn &apos;t know that i would be part of a technological revolution that would be true of this dream .
think about it . these men , who didn &apos;t have the same thing as i , helped me get through their granddaughter support , to get scientifically in law .
and then , usually , they were working with a kind of a little bit of a sudden , but by using a computer &apos;s and a little bit of the time , he could develop a machine that could read every single one .
but you know , i think it &apos;s very lonely to read me from machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books over the border , to the different of english countries , in the different english countries , the u.k. , canada , australia , and new zealand had had to have all different types of harry potter .
the most important thing . life has been doubled for a while , and it grows with a speed of five hours a day .
another thing . wish people like me happiness , okay ?
second , the new machine machine is a good message , because , once the usda take work , we don &apos;t have to do that anymore and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
the social challenges because of this inequality should be problematic .
the economic game is surprising , and surprising straightforward , especially on short view .
and my biggest concern is that we create a world , with a world , with a little bit of a human society , and it &apos;s driven by an economy that supports inequality instead of making possibilities .
in the course of the years , i started feeling increasingly more powerful with this notion of god .
some of you have a few of the things that we can only believe to a god who shares our pain .
in the second , the line comes to the line , &quot; wind and waves . &quot;
so who is god , if not the big of the big world or a half .
the loving soul of the universe .
by looking for the god inside , i &apos;m going to be my own foster .
one of the first things i started studying was the story of the world &apos;s technology .
we &apos;ve been able to find a lot of a time , which were older than 40 years , and the average age of this commodity and collectors tribes is 20 to 30 to 30 .
our bodies has used to this new diet .
so these equality of energy and matter , the einstein showed , and also shows the modern science of the world &apos;s science , that entropy and information and matter are all connected to each other , so it &apos;s a long continuum .
that &apos;s a robot that wants to stick its own plug to get more electricity .
and what i mean with that is that we &apos;re looking for your new job .
a great development , which has begun billions of years ago , moves through us and put it on . and our choice is kind of in technology , really , is really in it .
they said , &quot; well , we have five to 40 students in the world .
we were all down and found beautiful , and we found beautiful , and it had the look -- while we said , &quot; you know what , it looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
so we waited , we sat on the tables and we waited .
there are many more people . the only problem , especially for the adults that are not really known with the adult , they didn &apos;t really know that there was only one toilet .
the teachers we work with -- everything is different for teachers -- they say what we should do .
about 170 tutors have worked with them , and so this is what it works .
and right behind -- there &apos;s usually a little chain -- right behind , they were taught as children .
there &apos;s also these kinds of things -- it &apos;s a shelf that you don &apos;t see when you &apos;re in the world , but it &apos;s slowly open .
he &apos;s a little bit of a sudden . he &apos;s bringing his cousins .
he writes an email , he &apos;s going to introduce you to you every question .
i was this girl .
80 percent of refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s a page that thinks that peace means the end of the struggle , and there &apos;s a page that means peace is the creation of schools and jobs .
she sent her children to school -- found a new home .
there &apos;s also one , that &apos;s the manual for complete idiots , did you know that ?
on cape , there are a lot of roads , and we can all drive here .
that &apos;s my baby . thank you .
he basically said , &quot; i designed everything . &quot;
and in a certain sense , i &apos;ve always felt bad .
so i came up with this kind of complications .
i found that cheetos are very good .
the college is most difficult , so number 10 .
from everything in a strange way , about the most difficult thing about the time that &apos;s a window , it &apos;s been a window to the moment , in which the street was black , and this white white thing was there in the sun .
and i was reminded by the great presentation of karen armstrong , that religion really understood nothing with faith , but to do behavior .
the most recent thing has seen , geographically , the same size . it doesn &apos;t look like that , but it &apos;s exactly the same size as the united states , a field that &apos;s about the same size of arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the developed area .
we can &apos;t wait for the most of the time , the australia had to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of our whole civilization .
a new appreciation of the world &apos;s health that we have through the assumption of this challenge .
before i show you a few images to the preview , i want to point on this beautiful detail about the most of the time , and design .
rca is really an extraordinary school .
we &apos;ve discussed the morning with keith , that many scientists don &apos;t tend to show something beautiful in their talks , from fear , as stupid as a stupid .
here &apos;s examples that you can print textiles in 3d , which is very interesting .
so that makes us think more about what robots mean for us .
no . so i had to think a little bit ahead .
we did the same for iraq .
that was a challenge we had to ask as a physicist .
we can push it up . the forces are more . there are more of them , but they &apos;re programmed .
&quot; innovative seven &quot; a whole band .
and there are some employees in foundations that call this &quot; the &quot;
the idea of justice , which shows our lives , and gives us a sense of what &apos;s right in life , what &apos;s going on in life , which is what we should do , social justice .
and as that is , he &apos;s a while of the most powerful .
so every week , the most the time we would come to come to the world &apos;s disease . &quot; god , you answer me . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , an infection , an infection or a surgery .
the muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- call the way that .
we treat them with the medicines drugs -- the ones that are frankly , frankly , in this kind of pain , not very effective .
now you get a sense of it , like a lot of rock , how much rock we &apos;re talking about here .
it was 1908 . don &apos;t do anything . so i can live .
i don &apos;t know if you can see it from the back rows from all the time . these are just stars .
in 2005 , nasa started a probe called deep impact , which is a part of the part of a comet in the core of a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , like i said engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a more a bit of a sudden and we can change our future .
i led to this time , i led to this time , the only independent , to be exactly the only electronic medium of the country .
and i thought that the fact that the world &apos;s survival and a great company would be if it would be a little bit of it .
and at the end of the meeting , he says , look , it &apos;s not going to work , you &apos;re never going to see your money again . but my foundation will put 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test the idea .
and we said that -- that &apos;s okay , we &apos;re doing your business plan with what you actually did .
see , we started in the east and central asia with our work and went to russia .
after a while , we opened a little bit of a time .
and we &apos;ve developed the idea , spending bonds , bonds on the free press .
and on this way , you organized the funding , so that it doesn &apos;t have a blind , no blind , to go running around .
so why does it work like this ? that &apos;s the question .
well , some call this a theory of everything .
just an example is this : newton found the law of gravity , which works like one of the square of the most of the things that are going on between each other .
the more symmetry you have , the better you have the simplicity and elegance of theory .
one thing he thought was most of us today than given , but to his time , it wasn &apos;t granted .
it doesn &apos;t matter the meaning of this fan that they follow the laws , and accidents .
but he read in every free moment he had , books .
from this ambition , he driven into the most of the time .
but when he was just , his signature was deaf to the most of the time , his hand was deaf and she was crying because he had a thousand hands during a computer .
not very surprising -- it was only three women under the 16 house in the white house .
but i have to say , the older i became , the more i understand what an incredible privilege was , with this aging lion of a man .
and so as lincoln told the story , all of the war went to the u.k.
i asked my father under tears : &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
what the reason that i &apos;m going to do is be grateful for this strange love to be able to spend a life in the back of the past .
he had the temple of the temple and he was going to be the temple .
this is the most important thing that &apos;s the object that &apos;s proof of the jews for the exile in babylon , after all the years they were sitting in babylon .
all these are made by cyrus .
the most of the time is from the priests of the great world &apos;s priests , marduk , written .
they all know what happened .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of in iran came to tehran .
some knowledge more about the living living , but they still think they &apos;re a bad bad problem .
the new thing was crying in the first few hours , but their needs were not a clue and they learned to be able to work in less days . within less days , they were going to start in the air like all other .
a study shows that support support is 10 percent of a computer cost , while it costs about 30 percent .
and that was fascinated by me , because i had almost spent my whole life a camera .
you know , you know what to do to do a answer .
it was people there -- most of them and family .
we heard every single one .
but of course , he never came . the explanation has never happened .
and after many , many meetings , i was thrilled that this man , the buddha , really , really , is one of my heroes and mentors , it did it , to get a reminder of the boat .
so he said , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones who believed to peace and their possibilities , etc . , etc . , and they &apos;re actually going to be reality .
we connect to the world &apos;s -- i met a little bit of the time , i said , &quot; in london , it &apos;s about the truce . &quot;
it &apos;s about your own , to your business .
the biggest brains of the world should also be cognitively hopeless .
i went to the literature after the creation of this number , but i could never find them .
there &apos;s just a big brain brain .
and amazingly , that &apos;s exactly what our ancestors have invented 1.5 million years ago than they discovered cooking .
quite simple approaches for the most simple conversations that i led .
and i think i &apos;m standing on the beginning .
but once the fight , as soon as the fight , the physical rehabilitation was exposed .
behind him , a child , his son , red in the face , his father to push his father .
but mahmoud and his son were there .
i was talking to my boss at the night , and i told them -- i &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; look , we start with a few hours every day . &quot;
two groups of the world &apos;s favorite started fighting .
so i asked him , &quot; what does it go ? &quot;
&quot; but yes , we need to increase the production of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
and the most of the time , not just in the orthopedic center , but also in the houses of people .
and you should see me during a computer .
and this hospital would have been able to afford to be able to do this hospital .
why ? because the way i took that was banned .
but i learned something more than that , which is that the leaders -- the managers of the economy -- the best bad decisions that we had taken our economy is a short way ago .
because i knew that the state of the african continent would be important for my children and their children .
i &apos;m trying to try to bring the experience that i had in freezing , to africa .
is my time gone ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment from that one , which can rise a great society within a generation .
you &apos;ll notice that he &apos;s very similar to the yellow yellow ball -- the sun we draw as children .
in fact , that &apos;s something that half of you are , more than half , not being familiar with it .
32 pills &apos;s recovery &apos;s recovery .
and the most likely . &quot;
and that &apos;s the messages that they &apos;re going to be able to do ?
because , in the end , the glory love it , and so he &apos;s constantly bringing them into television .
a professional amount of magnitude that talks about dead , it doesn &apos;t get me ?
what is boat ?
we &apos;d like to have suggestions of you , how to be able to be a lot of people , and the more quality of authorities that they do .
thank you .
so the whole hospital is often running over a generator .
there must be something better . &quot;
but that &apos;s how the user can control whether there &apos;s just electricity or not , because you can get the most important on the ground , how much percent oxygen you give your patient .
but we want to be sure that this is the most effective and the way we can make hospitals available .
the different species of writing in africa , the first one was a lot of the time , how the script is more important , which is the most important society of the world &apos;s disease in the world &apos;s own .
anyway , when a &#93; day , after 1998 , a second called john healey was discovered in the most of the time in the world &apos;s health &apos;s disease , the centuries ago , centuries ago , the centuries ago .
almost a fifth of all greenhouse gases from livestock -- that &apos;s more than traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and the brightest to the line of the line and animals on the line of the line is not just like that .
and the most of the time was a french issue .
a picture of fish fish would be better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t quite bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
some of us would be my , that maybe not so bad .
about a year ago , i asked myself , &quot; why am i , although i know what i know , no a vegetarian ? &quot;
on the weekend , you have the choice .
you can make a picture with a iphone and you get all the names , although it &apos;s still going to make mistakes .
they stays distracted . he &apos;s going to win the race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would be my , it &apos;s interest , more about it , if the operations are so high , but it &apos;s a very large area .
or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a big piece of artwork .
the human nature has to change .
but part of the reason -- and that &apos;s why we have a ethical level in the ride that we have -- is that they &apos;re intrinsic valuable .
it could be more complicated in people , but maybe not very .
jh : is it embarrassed to play with these forces ?
and so i knew that i need something to control .
so there &apos;s a little bit of the time , because it &apos;s a dynamic , because it &apos;s the dynamic behavior of the liquid .
and so i think that you can be able to be .
this is a great playwright in the studio .
we take the pizza , our first pizza , and they &apos;re advising the individual slices while the messenger is in the hallway and we &apos;re going to be able to do it .
i was sure 20 , before i first went into an art museum .
i thought , okay , you have some criteria like you want to choose the works .
it &apos;s not photoshop work .
they &apos;re interested in creating a novel , alternatives , and they needed money for that , so they decided to make some interesting fundraising projects .
this project is called &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so we went to the grave and did this , it was doable -- the attention we got .
and she describes how the most of the time -- everything you say is because of the most vulnerable fruit .
he &apos;s a little bit of a sudden of the objection , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it depends with origami . so .
people used mathematical principles to understand the relationship of the underlying rules .
or they &apos;re going to take it on the top and they do 50 stars on a flag with 13 stripes .
how would you make a single flap ?
we found these rules with which you put circles , you covered the most of the time with lines that are tracking the extra rules . that makes the crease pattern .
you can do a lot of things .
but , if you want to make it bigger , you could need some origami .
and that doesn &apos;t work whether you &apos;re going to space or whether you go into a body .
i grew up in a state of washington in the state of washington with too much .
we only have three minutes . but we &apos;re talking about it for hours .
and so i want to talk about it , because if we don &apos;t recognize it , this transformation will be very painful .
and in a moment , i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;re going to see in the graph -- it starts in 1973 , just before women start to leave the labor market , and it &apos;s going to go to the day .
you gave instructions from top .
because i write about all this a book , i still have to do that , and i don &apos;t have any answer .
and that was very daunting for you .
there &apos;s still no way we have this information completely , and they come back to us in the form of culture , in this weird and a memorable way , where you can see that stereotypes change .
there &apos;s no man or no woman who &apos;s in the middle and that &apos;s the wires to the verge .
and that &apos;s where personal income is on a scale that was constant to consider inflation , to be doubling in this time more than doubled , right automatically .
and to hear me and understand what i say , you need about 60 bits per second .
it &apos;s still happening in the last book of me called &quot; good business &quot; i interviewed some ceo that were very successful from her environment as a very successful and the same ethical sense of the social sense .
control is also a safe thing , because you feel in your mind , but not very disappointing .
&quot; where are you born , and went to school ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they had their own meaning for what &apos;s home . they had their meaning for community , and even for hostility , which was going to be made on birth .
more and more people are in the future or present , as well as in the past .
i went down to the room where i should sleep .
and the most of the time , where is you home ?
there was a big gap between one billion in the industrialized countries and the two billion in the developing world .
but that &apos;s the world that we have today . no gap .
and let me show you why , by the time i &apos;m to the line , digital technology .
the kids are living in the new green .
and again , they were better than we said , &quot; your british and your mortality mortality is shocking . &quot;
but if you give people to people , you don &apos;t change the high number of heart disease .
and i immediately started working with the work of working , and then they grow , and then i worked with the -- mice , which couldn &apos;t produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my 15-year-old , and of course , i don &apos;t know how old she is .
you could be in the summer as well as the equator .
certainly many progress , many of the people live .
that &apos;s even real photography , in the time , that shows that the law is going to be in less days .
and here &apos;s the right thing , you see what &apos;s happening six months later , which is technically appropriate .
a blood vessel is two different types of cell types .
we then put it back into this oven-like device .
much more complex organs . with distance the most complex organs are the high organs , with each amount of blood sauce , like heart , liver and kidneys .
this is still in the most common .
we prefer cells that are not going to reject and not treating tumors .
we just need five seconds .
for every problem , anybody would have an idea out there .
so i &apos;m a little bit in panic -- unlike all the most of the environmental and sugar , which i had -- but this is for an entrepreneur really really nicely .
that doesn &apos;t mean you have to visit a little bit of a time .
i went from door to door and sold license license .
it &apos;s like a recession . so , there &apos;s a recession .
and you would do these chairs .
that &apos;s useless . &quot; you have to find a way to get faster to money .
i sold a lot of the time of the royal .
they don &apos;t get a regular income , but they have the opportunity to find more tasks and they learn to learn the ability of the most of the time , and they also learn the ability to find more possibilities .
if you go to a restaurant and be used , you &apos;re going to show you how bad life pumps looks like .
these young , the teenage .
the development of today is the students who are all the interests of the board .
the most of the time of the world &apos;s or a more , a lot of cultural health &apos;s disease is turning out of most of our students .
the values of the past are also going to be able to get out of the past .
but it &apos;s a politics of principles , not the most of the time .
they have a mind . and they have other people .
what we should do is we should be able to think about conservatives -- except this case of the 1980s -- what &apos;s going on is that you go to church .
yeah , i know you don &apos;t really believe me .
and that doesn &apos;t just lead to another result , it has the potential to change how we deal with each other .
completely different .
actually , it &apos;s not a right organization , but clear -- let me conclude that -- creative commons offers authors , a simple way to leave their content with the freedoms .

and it turns out we &apos;re covered by a kind of a computer , and these microbes are actually doing us good , rather than killing us .
they all have microbes and they used the small to the receiver .

there was only a few people shot in this incident .
it &apos;s 72 and it looks like this is the most important way of dealing with your deal .

&quot; yes , but why ? &quot;
we were four , not one , and fortunately , not a young boy .
you can &apos;t do anything about it .
it &apos;s never going to happen in india , because that was now and never again .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s pray . &quot;
this was a kind of a thousand inmates for over 1,000 inmates in this prison .
second , it &apos;s about the most important movement in india .
now let me tell you about a project that we did later , a kind of development of captcha .
basically , you &apos;re doing it by starting with an old book .
the number of pages are actually using the cause that the number of words we digitize a day is very , very big .
some are more funny .
at the time , the web is split in several languages .
then my favorite question comes .
there &apos;s a way to beat two flies with a stick .
but what perhaps is more surprising is the translations we get from the most of the time , even if you &apos;re just a bioluminescent , the translations we &apos;re getting is just like professional , and that &apos;s very surprising .
there are people who are learning as they &apos;re missing , they don &apos;t have to pay with money , they pay with their time .
the individual side , the company , makes it really good .
and the active participation to build the active participation is everything else .
and zipcar offers a very strict , a very strict service , the fabulous works .
for aristotle , happiness was good , the goal , the goal , on the other .
maybe these people have right . his thoughts is not good .
10 percent of the time is the thoughts -- ...
i played the violent africans , the african terrorists .
now , from the first time , no adequate outcome went out -- so nobody had the absolute majority -- so the elections were continued to go in a second round three weeks later .
here &apos;s a interesting comparison .
so i moved to la jolla , and i learned surfing .
people in the 17th century didn &apos;t really know how we &apos;re that this stuff is a bunch of different molecules , and that we &apos;re breathing out of a certain reason and so .
and so , charles said , i said , i &apos;m going to make money available , give you a building , and you can meet you there , but you don &apos;t talk about religion .
reality is what you can see .
i thought everybody with a little bit of mind that would do that .
just to see what would happen if you mix the two together .
so i have something that &apos;s not personally .
if you want to be rich today , entrepreneurs will be .
they say , if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , it doesn &apos;t go up -- it &apos;s not going to go up at all . we &apos;ve been measuring it for 20 years .
nanny kary mullis : the basis of modern science : the experiment . he tells stories from the 17th century and from his own favorite in the garden and the curiosity , inspiration and care of good science in all their shapes .
i wanted to represent a living body , which is that these are the most profound spaces that are occupied by the same time .
&quot; naked city &quot; is a nickname for new york and &quot; the &quot; &quot; naked city &quot; is the most powerful and the most of the time that comes from the feeling of the most of the world &apos;s feeling in a urban environment .
i love to travel , and berlin is one of my favorite .
and the whole time i don &apos;t see a single rat on some of these places until recently , when i was in london channels .
the first question is , and maybe they write them , either on a sheet of paper , physically , or on a virtual slate , and , for audience , they can try .
and we then interrupt , &quot; we &apos;re the best scientific school of the world , &quot; because of our british hubris .
except , that -- you -- you know , you know , in your donation , you thought , &quot; hmmm , what happens during night ? &quot;
and one of the most difficult problems is , if people have a idea of how everything works , it &apos;s pretty difficult to change this .
and as an expert for inorganic chemistry , i have friends and colleagues who differ between organic , living world and inorganic , world .
and you can see , he &apos;s going to see , it &apos;s growing , growing in a way .
we even have amazing life forms that we can manipulate .
and darwin himself turned into a letter at a letter that life probably came somewhere in a warm small pond -- maybe not in scotland , maybe somewhere else .
what is life ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can connect them and literally create thousands and thousands of really large molecules , in the same size as dna and proteins , but it &apos;s not carbon in view .
we want to put them in the environment and we want them to get their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can make inorganic biology and bring matter to it , it &apos;s going to define life .
but there &apos;s another reason why i like this development development : every single one is measuring .
and these are high female interviewer who sit on a woman sitting with a woman and ask her to ask her to ask her .
i was sitting on friday , i was really sitting on the friday of my computer , and i could see how the mortality mortality of this morning was on 84 .
as you know , these economists love the money , they always want more and more of them .
as you can see , it doesn &apos;t make sense to a average of a improvement that was not and very fast progress .
but you don &apos;t talk about it so much .
in fact , there were high , or very high , child mortality and the families were very big , six to eight .
here &apos;s also what recognizes .
whatever is worth more value for money .
yes , i went barefoot to 12 .
and he told them , &quot; imagine the most the question in question .
the whole time was a border of building .
and the most important thing , after my opinion , is going to bring forward to the world , will make a difference , not just for some , but for every one .
... above the knee , yes , that would be hard ...
the most important thing -- it took about 10 years and 700 million dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth is enough to satisfy everybody needs , but not everybody greed .
and tickets die .
i went to high school .
when i was at the council of scientific industry research , 40 laboratories -- if two of the things i was talking about , i built teams .
they &apos;ve been picked up and now i have apps in the app app .
it &apos;s about making something old and something old in the 21st century .
it &apos;s still very hot , but not more competitive .
but there &apos;s not a few times , but not under high pressure , and the hejaz is not so reactive , that means the reactor don &apos;t tend to leave the reactor .
i &apos;m convinced that the reactor i designed here , a innovative source of energy can be the great scientific projects with electricity and i &apos;m really ready to do this .
we &apos;re moving to a computer form , which is the experience that &apos;s the actual product .
there &apos;s a manufacturers of the most powerful that we &apos;ve got to be the case that they &apos;re going to run in the forest .
at the end of a long millennium good advice he &apos;s going to give his son , he says , &quot; especially , it &apos;s a lot of time against yourself .
you don &apos;t usually go in los angeles , but there &apos;s a place where you can walk out in this city .
then they &apos;re going to be wrong as wrong as a while -- by creating properties that they don &apos;t have .
when i was small , i was very questionable and stayed for me alone .
then it was just about start to start on a point and then build them to the end .
so i built it from concrete , because it doesn &apos;t matter .
this was this tool .
and for me , that &apos;s the most important thing . because since i was a kid , i wanted to convey my passion and love .
25 days : the ansari developed 32 days : poor and hands develop 36 days : the primitive spine begins to train these weeks .
the complexity , this is in a single system , and then it &apos;s beyond every understanding of understanding or every today .
because apparently there &apos;s no such kind of rough thing of this kind of ultraviolet thing in the atmosphere of sun-like stars .
so what can you do with these shots ?
recently , a colleague sent me from berkeley , a colleague of berkeley , a email with a very interesting spectrum and asked , &quot; can you look at that ? &quot;
there are two ways -- over the world &apos;s and the stars -- on the matter and chemical elements in the universe , and they &apos;re going to be made .
because can you imagine that everything is going to be a lot of the time ?
now imagine an object , an incredible object , or something we can &apos;t explain and we &apos;re just going to say , &quot; let &apos;s give you . physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
and if we see the world &apos;s , and oxygen , then i think we have the perfect e.t. .
i just said , &quot; really ? &quot; and he said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what i can tell you about is , you &apos;re universal ; we all have them .
i &apos;m easy to be hooked on the way , but that &apos;s another talk .
that led to a little breakdown -- -- that &apos;s actually more like this .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is , no , no , no , no , no . &quot;
what do you feel vulnerable to you ? &quot;
i &apos;m right , you don &apos;t have right . wait up .
we do that as if that , what we do , no impact on other people .
people are going to be their meals in twitter , the wolves of their children on the iphone .
so if we think about it , they &apos;re using systematic improvements , we think about how they can be useful to our own , for our favorite and ties .
and today i want to talk about one of the things that we decided to do at the time , because we wanted to find a new access to health care .
so steven shares his story . but he &apos;s not alone .
here &apos;s why people pray .
i also love this kind of implant implant , and that &apos;s the only more the most of the time that were online and available .
and here we have a paper .
you don &apos;t have a more a more , you don &apos;t have any data , you don &apos;t have a scientific methods .
that &apos;s the curve about the most of the time .
but my brother didn &apos;t go to him with him .
if we went from here today , we would go to something that are 300 feet tall , 120 miles wide , and the two of the screens weighs .
to change the state , you just need two volts of a computer .
we said , &quot; can you build that ? &quot;
we can do better .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that comes from the so-called called the so-called .
so , the biggest thing is , networks are ideals of complex systems .
and it also has implications on the world &apos;s everyday risk .
so we could put a snapshot of each other .
we see the emergence of the emergence of the world and the programs that are focused on understanding our connected world from the point of complexity .
and the most of the time , a capacity to have a capacity with a capacity of capacity -- except you use expensive pumps and valves .
and we had prepared 500 of these of us .
without human beings .
so we were up on our own .
and this graph doesn &apos;t even mean something that &apos;s invented data .
and my brain starts thinking very quickly that this is a representation of negative representation of negative to positive in the world .
because this question is moving , that our external world can predict our own energy system , but the truth is that i can only predict 10 percent of the world &apos;s disease .
and that &apos;s two reasons of scientific , and it &apos;s wrong .
we &apos;re moving people if they open their own , a positive email of the world &apos;s or the most of the time in their social environment .
hard to say -- a little bit of a sudden , you understand -- my father was the most of the time on the world .
and so i went to . i went to mit , cut off .
they said , do it stop .
they take a huge disk from cardboard .
he was the first digital media in tokyo .
listen , listen ? how cows ? this is four o &apos;clock in the morning .
so there are all these things to do , but most love i do , to experience the world .
and i was going to get that with passion .
their culture comes in schools , and i want to illustrate them , like we can overcome this problem .
that &apos;s why you do that nervous because girls don &apos;t want to go to schools where there &apos;s no young boy .
and over small moments in my life .
or mothers who have raised young ?
we need to change the posture to young school in elementary school .
and you have the impression that you believe that it would be okay .
let &apos;s look at where this hypothesis is going to be .
is that a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we believe that these are why we can give this &quot; why &quot; blogging evidence of nature can be .
i &apos;m going to try to get up at the end , and i &apos;m also excited if it works .
and that was really a important lesson for me that you can &apos;t really act on the object .
we &apos;ve created a newspaper for example , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s connected by radio with my ipad , and that &apos;s a software that &apos;s going on on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a little bit of a sudden . i added them to a computer , so that people in the glass are different when you &apos;re on them .
i &apos;m going to turn up by my current , i &apos;m going to turn up a man in a man , and then in an old man .
it &apos;s the most accurate thing .
radio : what do you think about it ?
fold only the wings together and drive them .
so i &apos;m going to ask you another question .
and he had a royal , and he had a royal , with the instructions , the instructions had to be a day and night , but with the secret instruction , it doesn &apos;t very well to the secret .
because they found that the human behavior is stronger .
yet , we have to create a clear of a very clear thing , which is what you can create , and it &apos;s also a lot of fair .
now , if we all have these tools to have , we have to ask the question -- and spaceshipone and the most important thing that we do is that we use these intelligent .
they lead the new to the new ones .
they give little , more , more , more , more .
i felt passion , soul and heart , had my body left .
audience : no .
sb : no , not &quot; without &quot; without &quot; .
all around us , the way we &apos;re going to do is make a different replicator in this kind of culture of culture .
they probably bought them .
imagine the world full of brains and more memes than a place for them .
we &apos;re the only ones we &apos;re the only more .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
that was dangerous , but hello .
they use us to transmit the resource of the planet to produce more and more computers , and more amazing things that we hear here at ted .
and will we get this third danger , how do we have the second and first one ?
in collaboration with the most of the time -- that &apos;s the most powerful in haiti -- with the ministry of public , with different kinds of things , we inspected more than 1,500 buildings .
it &apos;s not going to cost us anymore if we do it right . &quot;
and because i had a burning of 70 percent of my body , the whole thing took about an hour .
we also found that it would have been good , you would have given me a decision to recover the pain .
and how bad would the punishment be , if i would get caught ?
it wasn &apos;t that the most of the people -- the ones who have more commandments -- less cheated and that the less religious -- the ones who couldn &apos;t remember the commandments .
so if you don &apos;t think right for a few seconds , because you get a brand , does it make a difference ?
because it &apos;s like this .
i think all these forces have very bad implications on the stock market .
but you can believe me . i work in the commercial .
these are the most important ones i can show you today .
and suddenly amazon will be the brand and it &apos;s covered with the summit , defined how they want to spend their money , what money is and what it is .
maybe that seems to be a big leap ?
i don &apos;t have to explain the audience , i had to explain it -- last week i had to explain it -- i had to explain my girl &apos;s structures , who are gifted by a individual to another .
and i knew that animals like the most of the time , or even most animals don &apos;t stabilize their tissue by measuring them over bones .
and that was that every skeleton we found to the nature of nature was about the same more .
all of that i showed that was really surprised about it .
a funny song about global warming , from jill sobule .
well , i have to probably have to do it .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a piece ?
and the most difficult thing , and the most important thing , are the benefits of a great education .
the most difficult thing is , the most difficult thing about it , and ben became a more .
goes on , what is the area of this character ?
i was forced to leave my home , the democratic republic of congo , where i was a little bit of the time .
but the usda has the most promising of the united nations , the wealth of the country on 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not at the goal .
they have to be very inexpensive to be available .
but could not be done for this angle of labor labor ?
they asked by the governments , and they have a lot of people who have them , and they also have them .
but let &apos;s take a look at our goal , new economic act to the basis of the pyramid .
because they need a whole bunch of these little transactions to make their profits .
he liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to be in his own bed .
since for years , when sir was the most british , and the british society for the british society is that the sun seems to be .
so , what is fusion ? here &apos;s something .
and this energy is that the fusion is burning .
so , as high as conventional power power .
we need to do it to a power station .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country and it &apos;s also a great impact .
they wanted to be most of the democracy , but they were all the countries that have been held on the last month in the last month .
but the expectations of people have been left for their future .
so the question is to say , &quot; what &apos;s the male support for women &apos;s support ? &quot;
i promise you , she read the message .
nobody can listen to them , they just send them a text .
you could see the immediate impact of laws or the one of the most sacred speech on a computer &apos;s own , and see what happens as a result .
the flight took 12 seconds and went over 35 feet .
this is a rocket .
it weighs less than a computer .
from the smallest , the sheer forces of the ocean of nature .
we can afford to do that as individuals , and we need to get hearing .
we believe that somebody else , somebody else , someone &apos;s favorite , somebody &apos;s going to solve more tools of this problem .
we didn &apos;t flew it in the pacific .
it took 10 full prototypes , until we had something that &apos;s really flown .
and so there &apos;s this incredible humanoid , which is possible , and that &apos;s what it means , and that &apos;s what it means .
and let &apos;s think about our moral moral .
and the director was pretty intimidating and told me that he thought he was crazy . and he said to me , &quot; this place is a dog . &quot;
it took several events to do what i should do .
when i started with this program four years ago , my favorite plan was a little bit of the time to create the .
and you look down to the bottom , everything is so small and tiny .
i feel blessed and happy that i had the courage to give my post on nyu and return to my country , where i can do this incredible rides with this group of water .
and how often would my self die before i would understand that it &apos;s not going to exist from beginning ?
and i was a really good dancer .
so , in closing , these insights don &apos;t mean my low self-worth , this feeling of otherness .
that was because i didn &apos;t have any self , what was in between .
imagine what kind of existence we could have when we honor the inevitable death of self , the privilege of life and happy , which is next .
and this is a cafe at the sea in britain .
but instead of focused on the appearance of how we look at how .
we also discovered that as a structure of structure , we would get a structure and a kind of a way through this structure .
but we found that seeds -- this really important project is just going to find -- but that seeds are not going to be in the leading industrialized gardens .
we worked with a computer system to develop a little bit of the seed , so , even if you &apos;re visually impaired , it &apos;s kind of a kind of kind of kind of kind of the way that you see here .
it &apos;s actually the first few stages that you &apos;re looking at , and the rest is just for postcards .
the book is wearing the title &quot; the blank slate , &quot; the popular idea because the human mind is a blank slate and all its structure of his prayer , culture and experience .
well , there &apos;s a series of political reasons that they like to make people good .
it &apos;s still not clear whether these stripes are mathematically mathematically , but the most time the most important thing seemed to support this .
another one of the humanities and the most important thing to the universities are actually in the decline .
well , the other hot iron is parenting .
and i think you can &apos;t say that better .
i also call it a constructive , just like this , and you don &apos;t like it , but you don &apos;t confirm it .
there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no nonsense .
he says , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i think right now . &quot;
oh , i live in a computer program -- that &apos;s strange .
so i asked myself what would happen if we challenge some of these of the most of the things that would happen .
right ?
it &apos;s like -- we &apos;ve explained the war , when society , every one of us .
your iphone without the people who make the same skin , the same circuitry , make the same keyboard , always and again .
and then it was always more useful and more difficult and now it &apos;s a long time .
and i said to brian : &quot; what did tony do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; is it true that you &apos;ve been fake in here ? &quot;
but how do you sit on a mentally normal way ?
so , all of these things were coming to tony , evidence of it , evidence of its eyeballs , that he &apos;s crazy to this new kind of thing .
he came into a useful business and the family &apos;s 30 percent of the workforce , turned american cities just like this in the way .
and i added up , &quot; i have a list of conflicting features in my pocket .
and the jewelry are always the far aspects of the following of the following .
as well as that , that was two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended .
in fact , the trend went to the rest of the world .
and as a result of this conversations , it &apos;s very , very difficult to say , &quot; i represent the true islam . &quot;
it may be that a big war between east and west was going to be the extent of democracy against communism .
and even though the president , from the reasons , it &apos;s very , very good to the most , very good job to the islam , is not the enemy , is there &apos;s a natural impulse in the other side .
when the treasure sank in 2000 , you watch the peak of the best , the scientists who had ever had the scientists for african penguins -- that &apos;s what the time is endangered ways of doing it .
the day after our arrived , two of us were with the unconscious of the room two of us , and space two parachutes more than 4,000 with oil .
we &apos;ve used this method in the treasure rescue again .
and that &apos;s really important because the african penguin was explained a year ago a year .
on the top row , the row of the row , on the front of a day , on a front of a computer , in the most of the time , and even before the police police .
people are open for the most difficult .
we launched this campaign -- very fun -- , &quot; every egg counts . &quot;
this is not a second class of the second grade .
these teach the lessons was , abstract .
britlin hired himself on a leg and said , &quot; what &apos;s going on is that what &apos;s going on is your neighbors . that &apos;s the rest of the rest . the rest are comments .
now -- that &apos;s not the whole story .
and achilles takes a body &apos;s body and family , and the family is careful to see each other and see each other as a divine .
this is what the cells really look at me in biology and science , looking at living cells in the microscope .
every grain of sand has a size of a tenth of a millimeter .
you can see these kinds of things .
this picture was the beginning of the world &apos;s beginning .
we &apos;re all seeing the same from inside , believe me .
the walls are from 700 mm thick , solid concrete .
and that on the left is an x-ray .
it has human associations .
in x-ray , we see all the little things in the corners .
i had to be the car in the middle of the middle , and i &apos;ve been seeing no really simple task .
yes , they &apos;ve given 12 monkeys for a week , and after this week , they just used them as a toilet .
science actually says that we &apos;re going to live forever .
no , i &apos;m going to be a tooth .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you . goodbye .
where do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we &apos;re not going to agree .
not professor and exciting , only two spirits , ready to get ready .
and then my life was okay .
everything i saw in making it was that it was really possible between the most difficult between the most of the time between the most of the time and the most of the time .
would then be time to process information ?
we spent a lot of time with a billion dollars a business of business , and we &apos;re going to hear a billion dollars of business , which he was involved in , and what we found was shocking , but later , we found more .
then there &apos;s dan carroll .
we were upset that these companies had fast their own , and the most important in london are very much of the most important of them .
that &apos;s too complex and difficult to change it .
we &apos;re all going to die . we &apos;re all going to be old . we &apos;re all going to leave you . people leave us .
there are places that you can &apos;t go to , you can &apos;t think , you can &apos;t think worlds that you can &apos;t delete anymore .
they have a more a bit of a time and a freedom of that i think is the foundation of a new computer .
she has met the decision , not to get a more , or to get a fool , but your life is devoted to that that this is not happening any other girl .
we &apos;re all refugees .
but you &apos;re going to tell me this thing about the head , and then it happens .
but it doesn &apos;t . &quot;
i miss michael .
he didn &apos;t find that , but he didn &apos;t find him , but they said , &quot; you &apos;re going to newcastle , or you &apos;re going to die . &quot;
ah ! we meet them , the secret beloved . let &apos;s pull them out .
if it &apos;s on the box , which is the most important thing , it &apos;s going to be .
the characteristics that are going to be able to be able to see the word of the word is so often in adults that we should eliminate this age of the word of the word , to criticize behavior , which is associated with the most irrational and irrational thinking .
if i &apos;m the ability to get the ability of my sister , 10 percent interest , i &apos;ve been going to have a look at their ability to get more money from me to get more money from me to get it back .
it &apos;s why we don &apos;t live in the dark times .
and the third is all the sounds that we create people who are making the most important .
this is after selective selective .
there are many of the things that are a lot of the time of the pharmaceutical , under other people , like animals , and they taught us to dance for another time .
so that was extremely embarrassing .
and if you wonder how much that is , this is 16 kb .
so 37 is our interests .
it &apos;s very impressive and a very beautiful concert .
and these are the themes that are actually the heart .
a generation that &apos;s so much more meaning from video games , as from the real world .
all of these are problems outside my fins .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of video games mean for our civilization .
conclusion ! conclusion ! that &apos;s it .
he would like to do that right .
so , you get fast from the simple to complex , if you make more power . that &apos;s what we like .
and then they look at them , and they look at the relative -- i thought that at least long time , she was looking at it , to think about it .
it &apos;s going to go into the other direction .
girl : there was a sphere and a computer , because it &apos;s two completely different amounts of money , and if you fall them at the same time , you might fall .
but we could not train a thousand teachers to save our lives .
and it &apos;s a more powerful thing . &quot;
and then we &apos;ll change ourselves as we have changed the world around us .
that &apos;s going to have incredible effects .
why do you do what you do ?
everybody would want to want the new version .
they affect us too much .
they &apos;re even going to work over this time .
i &apos;m going to get his words back to the order of the order .
&quot; well , &quot; i said , &quot; strange , that you ask that .
it &apos;s like , &quot; you don &apos;t need to do that again . &quot;
we saw that , and i was grateful because she said , &quot; wow ! that &apos;s madness . &quot;
the goal of the project is just simple .
this is completely personalized medicine in the world &apos;s .
now the answer is a team of a team .
i work with the stretch of the stretch and the most serious thing , which was a few serious problems in the project , problems that should not have been .
in medicine , there are so many people who don &apos;t want change , just not if a computer engineer has been willing to be willing to be the answer .
you can really find novel solutions that were not seen , and that &apos;s very quickly and just .
yes , good , you &apos;re going to get me my life , because it was a lot of time , from beautiful precise form .
no , but it &apos;s true : the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i met the most of the time .
and i didn &apos;t ask them to draw nice cartoons .
thank you .
so , &quot; our lonely earth &quot; brought me every amount of time with the audience .
we have a lot of time for the existence of animals on this planet as they &apos;ve been here until we &apos;ve been reaching the second microbial era .
his impact is the distribution of this very thin , very thin , and we had a very small death of dinosaurs , the death of this beautiful , more powerful , and so much else .
it &apos;s the supreme tree , the t. rex of his time .
they hate us animals .
this is when material comes from the deep of the earth and the surface , spread over the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m a little bit away from the coast , what will happen with me ?
they have a crash . they have two options : they &apos;re going to die , or they take the hydrogen sulfide and , say 75 percent of them will be saved , mentally .
and the blessing : blessing and constructed .
some of you are countries who are thinking that deregulation or not the best way is the best way to promote investment .
the answer is just : the chinese define these factories as chemical businesses , not as a human being , and don &apos;t check them .
i don &apos;t know what we can do , but i can use my office at least to bring them together to develop a solution . &quot;
they need a safe environment .
now , we have the impression that it &apos;s about the beginning of a new kind of regulation of renewables .
human rights will be a very simple question : can i give these people back back ?
or otherwise the young to find the young , the fire has put the fire to see if you can change it . &quot;
okay , ready ? go .
i was fire and magnetism .
again , again , we saw how spoken poetry is going to be walls .
after the fight , he grabbed his favorite , &quot; he &apos;s got his hair , &quot; and she said , &quot; no , anderson , you &apos;re the god . &quot;
i travel a lot , if i teach , and i don &apos;t always get to see how my students are going to get their third step , but i had an happiness to see her journey .
my parents have called me sarah , which is a name of a name .
i want to talk about some ideas that have driven me to become a more a bit of a time .
when i saw that the war had been to get such an incredibly horrible consequences and that the most powerful thing was actually a factor in conflict , i wanted to be a photographer to be a war war .
at the same time , in south africa , after nelson mandela had been moved from prison , the black population of liberation was a half of the ocean &apos;s last phase of the liberation .
the next day i did myself on rwanda , and it was when i was up in the hell of hell .
after the fall of the fall of the , i started studying the conditions of poverty in a country that was on the way to modernization .
a hospital of the doctors without borders in a refugee camp .
the most efficient thing is that the percentage of the soldiers are living in a loop , in this war , a lot higher than in our history .
to make sure that so little as possible can walk wrong , we have all these procedures in the choice .
so you choose like this : .
but that &apos;s a broad and pretty difficult topic , so i had to split .
the size is the population -- here &apos;s big china , here &apos;s big india .
and in all eastern religions , japan was the same thing .
because death of a child &apos;s death is going to be a child .
and what is the reason in qatar ?
they have a great job of a little bit .
all religions on the world are able to mimic their values and adapt to these new world .
and then , as all of our generation , we lived in a more walkable .
day eight .
in india alone , my favorite friends went to the best friends and i went to door with this same picture , to every single house in india . we made a billion of them .
this is the most powerful .
i asked her -- it &apos;s all the most important -- and i asked you those questions that you want to ask you .
i think we &apos;re thinking of the proton of the death and ron st. john very much gratitude , i hope , ron is somewhere in the audience -- it &apos;s over there -- he &apos;s the founder of death .
larry brilliant : first , are you not mad because of the injury of the car &apos;s injury ?
have a little bit of a sudden , &quot; the climate group . &quot;
why should we have a positive impact on the world , on the world , as a company ?
they save 85 percent of electricity with a led that they would have used with an old light bulb .
sometimes people think that 100 percent are pretty hard , and we had this conversation in the company .
a little bit more paid to themselves in seven or eight years .
from our granddaughter , in ikea , are 47 percent women , but that &apos;s not enough and we want to close this gap and close this gap to high management .
there was a equation in my family , about this : if you &apos;re intelligent , you &apos;re not spiritual .
this is , &quot; he wrote , &quot; is the integrated structure of reality . &quot;
anybody whose attitude you &apos;re asking or you can send you away from the ears .
at the end of our favorite , we realized openness of other people .
as i would have paid to bangalore , and often i went home to the terrace discussions , where we discussed different issues , while they were going to get a drink more than a drink , which is often more than what they paid in their 14 years old .
he &apos;s looking for forgiveness , and he said he wants to be able to improve his child child soldiers .
this nations seemed pretty happy to be pretty happy , and it didn &apos;t have a deaths to be killed , although dozens of thousands of times were killed in liberia .
and how are we responsible for this ?
it &apos;s creepy -- not ? -- that the media of the world is doing a bad job that a small group of activists are able to publish more from this kind of information than the rest of the press .
j yeah . that was the cover in the guardian and then it was about kenya in all countries around kenya , in the most of the time and south african press .
j the effects on people who worked on it were barbie .
and there are lots of information .
i would be interested in what we &apos;ve heard about -- i &apos;m curious about the point of ted audience .
and we said , &quot; oh , tell us more .
so you have to be careful with the term of hackers .
and just one month ago , it was passed all the time from the parliament parliament .
and from all these numbers , i start with only two or three variables .
this piece here can be read very different , depending on where you &apos;re going to be able to do it .
first , i read about it in a fountain at a complaint , which was responsible between the most responsible medicine and seven of them .
so according to this research , the best thing is to be the best of a chicken , but not to let any of the long time in the way that black is going to take place , and a constant of light consumption .
and then the next summer , i worked under the line of dr. , and then i was going to go to the board of dr. , texas .
and this realization is incredible for efficiency , maybe for many different cancers .
for example , the arab organic connections are chemical pollutants that are in our schools , and they &apos;re found and found on the workplace .
because all of these solutions are , of course , they &apos;re sustainable and they &apos;re more likely to be -- the most important for our generation and for the generations .
and immediately , a voice called &quot; tembererana ! &quot;
after the conference , after my talk , people came to me , men and women .
hard !
a prosthetic is not for the need , a lack of attention .
we &apos;re all different from different perspectives .
i was like a beijing , and i was a beijing playing around the olympic games .
about 80 percent of these are young people , under 30 .
and they &apos;re most unemployment , they &apos;re the most unemployment , the banks of the banks , the environmental sands , the of the ocean , and america &apos;s products , they &apos;re producing them .
they have a kind of means that you can get on a piece of chicken or fish , and it looks like beef .
people think about this question : will we continue to keep our environment further to a higher gdp ?
there &apos;s nothing up there , but the conditions were ideal for the winter .
well , the series was not even out , so they &apos;re the first one that &apos;s going to get this .
mars is similar to the earth , it seems to be the same as the earth .
sousa was afraid that we were losing the opportunity to lose , quote , &quot; machines . &quot; they would take us .
but much more importantly , bmi used to use available works to create new amounts of work that they &apos;re going to be able to do in their customers . then in 1940 , the majority of the channel was to bmi .
and i ...
for the balance i &apos;m going to do , i &apos;m trying to do a good liberal , of course , to demand something from the government . a mistake , right ?
this realization is incredibly sophisticated , incredibly sophisticated .
okay , i don &apos;t want to thank you here , but i &apos;ve noticed that the person on the right is a liar .
&quot; honey , you don &apos;t see fat , no . &quot;
but another study showed that strangers are lying in the first 10 minutes of their meeting .
here &apos;s a child with her kitten .
i &apos;m going to say it again .
look carefully at liars don &apos;t want to look at the eyes .
we say , &quot; yes , while we shake the head .
science has been brought very much more signs to daylight .
look at exactly and you &apos;ll see the whole video , and you &apos;ll see the following smile .
in this way , in this particular world , it can be sense of us , a little bit more likely to be in terms of our moral rules .
and that &apos;s not true , right ?
you know , we often think that language is the world that we live in , but that &apos;s not true .
so what &apos;s as a kind of a time , if not even tragic joke about harry , is a reminder of ethnic .
six months after any explanation , they were going to be free .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do .
when i was 10 , i read james &apos;s &quot; more &quot; difficult country , &quot; and i &apos;m broken .
a new song i proposed to you .
so i took a little time to study coke .
and in the remote areas of africa , it &apos;s hard to find a good road .
how do you give them incentive based on the effects that you have on these remote villages ?
i don &apos;t have a lot of the way to do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they &apos;re waiting for being cut .
much more people would have been convulsions .
today i &apos;m going to tell you two things . first , what we &apos;ve lost , and secondly , how we get it .
here you can see the largest part of the living of the florida of florida .
if there &apos;s no fishing , if there &apos;s no fishing , because it &apos;s protected , or isolation , it &apos;s great .
after a few years , after five to seven years , the fish come back , eat the sea , and then the algae grow again .
you can see the border of the most of the time , because there are the boats all back back .
if it &apos;s so good , if that &apos;s so simple , how much is it ?
so the protection of the south pole is to be the south of the south pole and the ocean for money and the body institutions , and that &apos;s not acceptable .
in the coral reefs , we found that the pyramid is the equivalent of the equivalent of the pyramid , where five lions come to a computer system .
okay , jake , thank you that you have a part of your spiritual experience . thank you .
it has been the longest creature in the ocean .
they come to the submersible -- they come to the window and look at the back .
in other ways , we &apos;re trying to do with our partners in woods hole , these virtual world -- this world , this is going to be correct -- to get into the lab .
bl : these worms don &apos;t have a more a brain . they don &apos;t have a mouth .
what we &apos;ve seen was from the pacific .
we &apos;re going to try to show you the pacific in the world &apos;s water .
these worms grow several inches in the week .
the concept of the most of the time is satellites .
and the rest of the one percent is looking for the formula that you can apply in the situation .
they also have the mathematical structure that &apos;s from the world &apos;s disease , measurements , the dots , points , axes , etc .
the students have to create these kinds of create . they have to make them .
and the best thing , or one of the best parts , is that we don &apos;t get the answer from the end of the world &apos;s end .
what &apos;s going on with the small hadron collider ?
here you find the fastest growing boy worldwide .
it &apos;s a little bit of the time . there &apos;s no government schools in the slums .
this is a computer that was installed on the entrance to your slum from a vegetarian socially intact entrepreneur called sugata mitra , who took the most important experiments , to help you learn that children can learn under certain conditions , moving on a computer .
well , the key is motivation , and that &apos;s in two ways .
this is a school in a bus in a site in a site in port , which is the fastest growing city of asia .
they should turn it into a mcdonald &apos;s .
there are formal frame , schools , hospitals , hospitals , in which innovation can be able to be , and informal environments , communities , families , social networks .
every child to age 15 , which wants to have a place in a school , 2015 will be able to get a one .
and while i look at him , this scene comes to tears , and i &apos;ve been talking about the 25 years for 25 years .
here &apos;s a few parents from teenagers &apos;s , all of us have to cook for them -- and they &apos;re going to eat every night for two , three or four . it &apos;s ridiculous .
he &apos;s going to go around and rebuild everything !
these gay , people like me are treated as full citizens , and it &apos;s written directly before our nose .
there are people afraid to have their job , so they don &apos;t show who they really are , at home . it &apos;s not just north carolina .
think about it .
and i was afraid .
about three years ago , i read a article in the new york times .
who were my grandparents ?
she helps us become what we could have .
so evolution works .
and in fact , here &apos;s this insect .
i &apos;ve smells earlier before someone .
he &apos;s not just waiting for 43 to 44 degrees c for about two days , but it &apos;s a constant temperature .
but the contrast is about this way . it &apos;s going to be out of the background .
here &apos;s the americans who are offering the russians , and yes , it was -- actually -- a game .
she started telling me about that , and all parents are going to recognize the most parents .
i have a finite story .
our lives is determined by data , and the presentation of this data is to create a chance of creating fantastic interfaces that can tell great stories .
i also put a look at the different of the different things , because you can pick out what you want to highlight from the data .
it &apos;s a man &apos;s man who &apos;s sitting in the box and controls this kind of thing .
a little bit of a sudden of about 11 sheep per hour , which is a little bit of a 68 cents .
in the bottom , you can do that -- what you see on the left is the most powerful thing , and you see the frame of the frame of 16 people who had no idea what they do .
business bell : business , business -- aaron , aaron : and we took all these individual pieces and the most of them in a mechanical turk .
but we knew we needed the right person to put us behind and build for that .
and underneath all the individual frames , people have committed the project .
thank you .
so i made rows of images , cut , and they added them together .
a shoreline of it is that you &apos;re always seeing one part of his image , and that leads to a very free design .
and sometimes i have an emotional response to news , like the earthquake in haiti 2010 .
then i went 50 miles , then 60 miles .
it &apos;s like the different layers we &apos;re doing , and what we &apos;re doing is present the world as our identity .
another thing is in a public library in san jose , california .
so every building has its own personality .
it &apos;s perhaps easier than ever before , to save a good living .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re particularly disappointed .
it &apos;s just too strange .
you know , in the middle ages , in england , if you met somebody who was very poor , you called this unfortunate . literally , somebody who &apos;s lucky , the fate .
and that &apos;s going to be done in the youngest court with angels and floods , and the sky is going to open up .
i told you the action of the senior collider .
what i think i think was really talking about is success and failure .
we should make sure that we are really the creator of our own ambition .
alain de botton : a computer &apos;s , a kind of purpose
if you train for this sport , you don &apos;t smile .
you know , you &apos;re going to be executed with the most of the time , and you &apos;re going to be 60 trains per minute , so you never really see anything about it .
they &apos;re in the liquid .
my breath is down to three of the time .
that should be worried about me , i didn &apos;t make it .
i swam with this thing .
it &apos;s the only more powerful thing that i &apos;m interested in .
there &apos;s already today .
the gateway can be a smartphone , or it could be a particularly more , like , a lot of these things , like today , because they &apos;re not so good .
many of you have the phillips direct life .
this is a more important part of our lives . we should sleep a third of our lives .
ok . let &apos;s go from sleep to disease .
so we can change medicine in the most square , in all ages , from caps or children to the seniors ; the entire spectrum of the disease -- i hope i &apos;ll give you a sense of it .
so , i hope i &apos;ve convinced you -- the effects on the most powerful are enormous and the effects on diseases are also amazing in all these different diseases and more .
how do we do robust societies ? longevity .
and in the novel , a certain called alvin is produced . and he says maybe not the best way , and destroyed the whole system .
and so there would be no more a time .
and it &apos;s a great thing .
naked should be faster .
maybe they ask themselves how we do these things .
our only cookbook is the only cookbook of the world , in the curvature of the world .
this is the finished hamburger .
a talk about surgical robots is always a talk about surgery .
and surgeons were more business than doctors .
but ultimately , the woke up .
they had to give their intuitive movements with the instruments .
i told you about the big , complicated robot .
and as you see , it &apos;s out there to do something useful , it can &apos;t stay there .
and we don &apos;t even have to be scanned to this kind of thing .
we &apos;re here to talk about accidents .
but we had a problem .
okay , well , it was partly my fault .
we don &apos;t just have shown that bacteria can be the solution for plastic waste , but also that openness is the openness of the openness of the risks and that &apos;s what openness is about risks .
the film we &apos;re going to see is made you for the most of the time in new york .
i &apos;m not an exception .
it went on . they always tried to make things better .
they don &apos;t say , &quot; our style are curves . let &apos;s make the house of the iraqi . &quot;
i think in my family , we had a lot of happiness , because we &apos;ve learned design backwards .
and the one of the things that we do .
ed : and then the row of the row is a historical site . there &apos;s a historical site in the north history , which has been taken in the front of the message .
see this chair there ? the orange ? that &apos;s the most the chair . 1940 .
because it &apos;s part of where we want to get .
it was a full of outrage full of outrage . they were full of speculation . they were a solid information .
one of them is known : the population explosion . the world population has gone from two to almost seven billion people in the last 50 years .
brent paralyzed : being here .
you see the lines check out when the population population is happening .
before i talk about the cost , i have to hold very clearly .
so liberation actually looks like this .
but only since recently , we can , thanks very technical progress , now the quantum theory and quantum locking .
first of all , some strands of magnetic field are trapped inside , but the superconductor doesn &apos;t like it , because they &apos;re moving , because they &apos;re moving out , and so the most of the time they &apos;re going to keep the energy .
this round magnet can also expand , of course , to form a killer superpower .
and it was inspired by this quote from douglas adams . the situation is from &quot; by the galaxy . &quot;
because of course , they don &apos;t explain how to do that , if you want to do it , and no one has a more a bit of a time .
but even though they were not convinced , they said , &quot; okay , we call back . &quot;
and the reason i &apos;m doing is , yeah , i have .
so some of you will say , &quot; what will happen if moore &apos;s law are going to be on his borders ? &quot;
today you can buy half a billion . and you &apos;re even better , because you &apos;re faster .
but where are we going to get the software ?
larry page has been a passionate talk on our own , which he &apos;s going to be able to ask for this big challenges of humanity .
they wanted to start the fish .
that may be insignificant , but it &apos;s incredibly scary , which is a lot of rumors to hear that another one is bigger than the last 13 a.m.
so the tsunami can be seen as a kind of a bloody moment , a moment where the blogosphere was growing up .
probably you &apos;re probably in three to five percent of the number of serenity in the glass , and it would be better than the estimate of 90 to 95 percent of you .
somebody mentioned something , so others are link , etc . , etc .
he finished his favorite , and i &apos;m waiting for a 300 pounds of heavy plans , but he just says , &quot; that &apos;s all i want to do . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you 30 seconds of film , and i &apos;m going to end up with 30 seconds of the thing without the skin .
this habitat covered more of the earth &apos;s surface than all other habitats together .
many of us , i &apos;m locked , i think , is that the exploitation of the oceans are only in the last 50 or maybe 100 years seriously .
this about a cable connected vehicles are our eyes and hands for work on the sea floor .
so there &apos;s a pavement on this product that tells the computer exactly what the product is .
but i want to share with you some of my favorite discoveries of the census .
we don &apos;t know why they do that there , we don &apos;t know .
this graph is based on a brand article that &apos;s going to appear in the journal of biology .
but that &apos;s not all about it .
as an architect , i have to confront something like this .
mitchell mitchell : don &apos;t build a house , grow it !
i think that &apos;s very interesting and very supportive , because what they &apos;ve heard in the last few days is the sense of walking in different directions : directions that are specific and unique for the problems .
well , we all think that the most obvious thing was obviously a big romantic poet , many of us forget that he wrote some wonderful stewards , and the most famous essay is a called &quot; a defense of poetry . &quot;
i &apos;m going to read you that .
and to a certain time of his life , they &apos;re going to be on rocks .
but let me show you the latest robotic robotic .
if you used to go , before the digital radio , the moons of the artery , and &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel &quot; on the channel , that was this noise .
the idea of the most of the time is that you have two sources of information that the conclusions are eating .
that means i have to predict the future .
now , there &apos;s a very clear example of where one of me feels like a different deal of the champagne , when he had been produced by another person .
and in the meantime , i got two daughters .
so they didn &apos;t know the rules that the other person plays .
if these dots were cars on a computer &apos;s own , they would have no idea what &apos;s going on .
we showed that we can explain a big part of the data -- people actually plan their movements to capture the negative consequences of noise .
this is from the most of marine province .
mars has the largest largest of the solar system , the most of the solar system .
this is my favorite . it was taken only a few weeks ago .
the oldest stone on earth is just 3.6 billion .
and the result of our meeting was a kind of a little bit of a sudden called karajan .
we fold it , and we transport it into a spacecraft .
this is about the most of the time , oregon .
i think on the packaging , let &apos;s look at this -- &quot; eight to 12 . &quot;
and there was a guy who sold this weapons for lego , because lego -- the most , no , they &apos;re not on guns .
and then there are some examples of the stuff , and then there are real sculptures .
i have to tell you , for me , for me , this evening was changed everything .
maybe most importantly , the influence on other companies is enormous .
in fact , politics is emerging .
in brazil , there are now five times of the day , whereas the united states is only 700 , and the world &apos;s only two in california -- and within three years , the percentage of the world is up to 85 percent .
that &apos;s not a lot of the time . biofuels are a really big thing .
scientists explain us -- and these are just estimates -- that we have to be half the main gases of greenhouse gases , and that &apos;s how fast as possible .
i can &apos;t wait to see what we tedsters against the crisis companies .
there are always less people who are available , which is they could be skeptical , and then you get this kind of thing to the curve and you get this classic curve .
b is at the edge of the network .
and that &apos;s what happens to every outer nodes .
the red dots are going to be the most important , and the yellow dots are going to be friends with flu .
would you get immunity on the ground ?
and there &apos;s , i think , three ways of being used to this data data .
the building was in building the collapse of the economy and death of the beginning of the &apos; 90s .
although it seems to be a totally chaotic place , if you see it from top , there seems to be a whole net of the world &apos;s and channels that connect every single house .
in this tradition , the future bride shows all their possessions , which is going to be going to be your new husband .
what a place like the genius david is particularly remarkable is this kind of kind of kind of kind of thing that people have to use .
we can only ask , &quot; how are the most important of the world &apos;s favorite ? &quot; and what we want to ask is -- or what else we want to ask .
it &apos;s replaced the workers through technology .
you can see some symbols on the left , some symbols that show what &apos;s going on with his right arm .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re always going to be older .
or even if we &apos;re going to be much older , our cars to drive our cars , so we can visit people .
they were gone in a moment .
it was always more obvious that we can &apos;t win .
the two specialists behind the curtain will help me bring the result to the screen .
one of the journalists asked , &quot; what happens ? &quot;
the tides are the same , as jewish , as a jewish .
i think there are some reason , actually , many reasons , but here &apos;s just some of us we focus on .
he was attracted by the fire , he was enjoying them , he was like a computer &apos;s light , a little bit of a little bit of a sudden .
let me go from door to door at the international community , and see if i &apos;m going to have somebody forces or troops for these are .
but sergio was too late .
he saw her .
decentralized power about a complicated hero .
this means jobs and possibilities of all the time .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about the one of the food because actually this year , last year , and 2008 during the most of the time , there &apos;s calories for calories for every single kilo of calories .
and i go into these stores when they &apos;re there , honestly out into the fields to see what they can get , and i &apos;m going to be able to get them .
we see changes of participation in schools through girls .
i want to talk about something that i call digital food .
and what i found is that instead of investing in subsidies and other things , invest in school program .
thank you .
we could do the same thing at cancer .
they &apos;re not going to go to a computer system .
it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a device of a device , not because it shows me how many of the day i &apos;m going to do every day , but because it &apos;s 24 hours long , what i do .
that was never shown .
the productivity of these magnets is so big that we can see a single neutron with this technology .
that you don &apos;t have to reject the tumor .
if the magnet is big enough , and their resolution are high enough , then they can actually be all the proteins in the body and start understanding the individual system .
most of us find the comforting , and interestingly , 12 vibrations per minute of a sleeping people .
for example , if i &apos;m here -- longer than a few seconds , they would feel uncomfortable ; longer than a few minutes , and they would leave the hall in the workforce .
that &apos;s all recognized . and that &apos;s the tune that are most likely to hear the most common in the world .
and i stood there with two very good friends of mine , richard , and kevin &apos;s .
while we cross miles and miles from the world &apos;s -- frozen , the most powerful , could be the most powerful .
so , as i stand here today , i &apos;m talking about the most about five years of the world .
just 10 miles before the coast and in the north feet , deep feet .
the ocean determine climate and weather , they hold the temperature stable and shapes the chemistry of the world .
and there are easy ...
that &apos;s the result when you don &apos;t know that there are borders for what we can take the ocean .
in the past three years , the united states have been protected by the world , for example , as a result of the world .
we need the zabbaleen , new technologies to exploration the ocean .
a lot of my early career wanted to figure out how the wings of insects create enough force to keep themselves in the air .
let &apos;s study this idea of simplicity .
this is a beautiful picture of visual , a mouse of the lab from jeff , and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk .
they &apos;re going to be a more powerful , to make some behavior smile , another single one of the other things that have another more , and patterns and they can think that this works in a very complicated system .
our mission is to build a more powerful and realistic computer model of human brain .
he &apos;s home and drink tea .
if you &apos;re looking closer to the surface of the neocortex , you &apos;re going to be involved in louder small components .
how many per type of type there is there ? where are you wearing ?
we can look at the tissue . and we can change neurons .
we can upload all these neurons , every single one in its own processor , it &apos;s going to activate , and watch what happens .
and the most of the time says that the secrets of the brain can be solved by the brain . mental illness , memory , perception : they &apos;re from neurons and electrical signals , and he &apos;s planning to find them with a supercomputer that &apos;s the brain with the brain .
it would be two or three thousand bombs .
the air force started building smaller models , and started doing this .
that &apos;s what nasa did to get a more a bit of a sudden that would fly to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about a little bit about the kind of thing .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write . because there &apos;s so much resonance that you can get from people .
the bottom ? yellow .
if you ask people to ask these questions , they usually think it has something to do with the culture .
the countries on the right , the ones that are very much giving up a lot of different form .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this .
but it &apos;s going to get back to the more complex .
a online online for 59 dollars .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we really don &apos;t know our biases so well .
in fact , in medical medical , this is our view .
and radio waves are limited .
abstractions -- you can only use the eyes of the eyes with lower energy .
their intensity can be very fast , and they can be very fast .
they &apos;re critical critical .
but the only thing .
cars have a lot of cars and they can communicate and communicate and communicate through the water lights with the cars and so on .
dna is what life is mean .
because it &apos;s actually not so many data .
you have the genome , and you have a computer , and the power of a computer medicine is better than that -- it has no side effects .
he &apos;s really just -- it &apos;s just a weekly gene -- but we could completely rethink it .
we &apos;re not running as a small organisms alone on the world , but they &apos;re part of a big ecosystem .
the consequences can be bad -- if we poison or the earth -- but that &apos;s just the consequence of one of us .
now i &apos;m mostly here because there &apos;s a kind of dig in the moment that we have on the moment that we have on one side of people who think that you &apos;re going to perceive a dog , first of all , through rules , human rules .
they &apos;re just like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no , we &apos;re doing &quot; puppy , sit . &quot; boom , he can try to be six to 10 .
these are like golden .
and i would say , if you don &apos;t need it , you should not be .
not only with the builders , but also with the rest of the family .
these are so simple .
their children are just to train .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , and this windmill -- does it work ?
wk : yeah . i still think about energy to work .
because even though i used scientific terms , it &apos;s sometimes very hard to sound it .
and even less , if it &apos;s accompanied by the most of the time , and the way that it &apos;s accompanied in my case .
one is a white light bottle .
64 multiply with 75 .
let &apos;s look at the third question .
the desert expands a mile or two per year .
the homo erectus asked the same tool about 30 generations ago .
you can teach you in the lab , to practice a little bit of cleaning up , and there &apos;s actually a little bit of a time in other animals . but the exchange of a object never happens .
it &apos;s the wealth of wealth ; the gratification of your needs , time to save time .
we &apos;ve reached this as a species .
but there &apos;s no evidence for that .
and when people started with that , objects like this was a little bit more , that was a hint of the groups that existed between groups .
but who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
but that &apos;s me because of the connections that people go to , and that &apos;s not where the ideas are going to be the way to meet and to be able to be able to make it better .
this is so high as a building building . i &apos;ve got the hybrid of the age of the age of the age .
but we don &apos;t talk about it , we don &apos;t take it seriously .
they &apos;re just gone , these feelings , they &apos;re gone .
if we think about the most of the time , the early development is usually the problem is , how can we discover things that change all the time ?
i talked about it -- you know , you know , this situation when you don &apos;t get a diagnosis in the hospital ?
what about real people ?
we were going to put a part of their viruses ; it &apos;s new , far more , very far .
after 10 more days with fever , she came back -- still fever -- she &apos;s got a little bit of oxygen in their lungs .
it wasn &apos;t even sequenced very often .
it &apos;s a classic embarrassment , but it &apos;s completely new . nobody ever saw it before .
a huge battery could have been that .
let &apos;s invent something that fits to the most of the time of the world &apos;s .
i brought a little bit of a little bit of the time on the top of the , a high density , a high density , and the presence of salt between .
but david is young and smart and he wants to build a little bit of a sudden , and so he builds -- he &apos;s building the first metal metal with this chemical composition .
so what did we learn from all of the things ?
this video was taken in the most recent . six miles before the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the world .
quickly , we realized that our garage was not big enough for this growing project .
i started interested in maria &apos;s and her methods and how they found these things and how important they found that children are discovering things and they &apos;re not taught to be a open way of being a open kind of open way .
evolution is often seen as this one way that we chose , but it actually represents a big number of possibilities .
i &apos;m going to skip this until the phase of space space .
our cities are at risk , because many of them are on the coast .
there are also stars and so forth .
so if we think about the body system or body language , like the social scientists , it &apos;s about language . we think about communication .
this expression , also known as pride , was studied by jessica tracy . she showed that a lot of people and born in blind people , this is what they do when they win in a computer .
so i thought about it . you &apos;re true on these people and see how they participate . could you get it to be able to engage and get more involved ?
what happens to a computer system , what happens when you &apos;re going to get on the bottom stage ? how the following little manipulation , these tiny are the tiny ones ?
that &apos;s what happens in the lab . the little exercise , for just a few minutes . where can you really apply that ? that was important .
these things are like that . people are kind of showing me their true . they show themselves .
she was completely depressed and said , &quot; i don &apos;t have to look for anything here . &quot;
they need their bodies , privacy and two minutes . it can affect the other life in the big way .
and the swim are swimming in order to get to their own , and they &apos;re a ant , and they &apos;re going to be a ant , they &apos;re breeding in the brain and drive a blade of grass like a jeep .
and you have to have a kind of kind of a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of thing that you have to do .
so it &apos;s like i think richard and i realized that these ideas are not abused .
and of course , they &apos;re extinct now .
but under all these ideas that are inevitably spreading our technology in the world , many toxic ideas are .
and as viruses should be , we &apos;re not trying to destroy them .
and in my game , it &apos;s called you .
we put some ideas on the legs , we went international on tour .
i know you &apos;ll tell me , &quot; t is not there in music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
nobody hears each other . nobody &apos;s familiar with the other .
they &apos;re going to see the orchestra in a kind of a kind of a hoodie .
i don &apos;t want to get out that that &apos;s not going to have happened , but that we need to be better if it &apos;s about answer the questions that you have to consider and the reactions .
they work in government government . they &apos;re driver .
five dollars can save a life .
she deserves about two dollars a day , building a little bit of a sudden on and explained that they &apos;re not going to have married children before these things are done .
finally , from despair , they went and a way of old woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , if you &apos;re angry , you &apos;re going to be the best talk you &apos;re ever going to regret .
okay , the big majority of us .
his message was basically unity , the connectedness of everything and the unity of everything . and his basic value was respect to strangers .
who fighting while he goes ?
they start to go to israel and palestine , in jordan , in turkey , in syria .
and so more and more of the more , and more of the time , it &apos;s been a income , and it &apos;s been a income to support their family .
just go to somebody , with another culture , from another ethnicity , with another ethnicity , which is somehow different and put it into a conversation ; listen to him .
i start where the story started , 1985 in the world .
today , before you &apos;re going to be the way you had the opportunity to a shower ?
you see here -- 35 percent of these less famous houses , where 50,000 indigenous people live , 35 percent of the houses had a license shower .
21 percent of what we fix is follow by the most of the time , things that were actually built around .
we did that . he was going to have a little bit of the time .
we found out that in this region , failure is the cause of disease and death .
one thing is in the context of everything we &apos;ve done , the middle of the world &apos;s , nelson mandela didn &apos;t say far from here : &quot; how slavery and apartheid is not intuitive . it &apos;s the work of people , it &apos;s the work of people , it &apos;s the work of people .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to be a little bit of a time . really not .
it sounds really called the goggles , to say that from here , but if you &apos;re trying to use it , it &apos;s amazing effective .
i &apos;m going to go to you with this statement , i think , in the belief that children shouldn &apos;t leave their community to live in a better .
this is the youngest &apos; 60s in america with our favorite jaw of the bronx .
this is a picture of the mayor of the bronx , which is the kids in his house , not in prison , so they felt like they felt .
we gave something back .
if you &apos;re big kids with little kids , they &apos;re the big , thick man in the middle , which is cool , and they create these responsibility under the most incredible .
now , you might wonder about these kids .
hold kids away from these stores .
stephen abani : a teacher who &apos;s the south bronx
second , i bet that even you see the difference here , you see the difference here , a increase of the computer &apos;s right line .
to be 10 : extend the pig a heart attack .
people with migraine migraine , who have an aura , have a band with nervous neurons -- here in red -- in red -- that &apos;s moving three to five millimeters per minute .
the problem is that 30 million americans have migraine migraine , and we need a little bit of a time . i think we have now .
my first wish is that the most of the time the most important thing is that the most of the time is epilepsy , the most of the time , for the treatment of the other , is used to the treatment of other people &apos;s treatment .
lawyers are taking cases on the hope in the hope of the in the bookstore , which is the most poor patients full of pity .
a year ago , four of the five of the most of the most of the most of the time was ushahidi , which is called &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot;
where do you know what &apos;s important about what &apos;s important ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i &apos;ve got it the first time to get it here .
these people are calling up below the barrier , because they &apos;re really going to be able to share from the process , you know to share with the world .
they have to use , &quot; a platform to use , &quot; to develop their materials and develop their materials , and they &apos;re fighting in 84 countries around the world .
yes , books , which are sold 100 or 1,000 spending in the year .
it didn &apos;t surprise everybody that &apos;s like all , right ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so that &apos;s not very hard .
the days of the most recent , the time people say , &quot; well , we &apos;d like to have three or a half of them in our country to see how that works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a single bit of a time . it &apos;s an education project .
you can use a few thousand children with two of them .
so it &apos;s like an electronic book .
everybody says that &apos;s a 100 dollars per laptop that can &apos;t do that .
and that &apos;s the launch .
they click around things and stare at screens . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no . there &apos;s another way . &quot;
we &apos;re all playing &quot; i love lucy &quot; on a big line , and we can &apos;t keep it .
thank you .
i think most people think that a hiv-positive mother , always her child , is too distorted .
that &apos;s not possible . that &apos;s not .
it &apos;s going to be good . you &apos;ll live .
first , to prevent the most of the time .
two years ago , one of the mentor mentor mothers came to me and told me a story .
how do you build a better health system ?
the most important thing is , how simple the system is .
if you look at the volume of gray substance in the age of four to 22 years , it takes a ph.d. of childhood . it &apos;s going to be the early youth .
the idea that your father in the public was singing in the public , so you get to be able to get a lot of it .
that &apos;s the most important thing we built together .
after the first year , it was invited by the aravind occupation museum in austria to install it in his lobby and i &apos;m happy to say that there was 24 hours a day .
but in the night , while we were going to be able to get the width , i asked the board , like the most of the time they were kiss sam dickens .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place that my family has been working on for four generations .
very honest : i don &apos;t know what it has with shepherd , but they &apos;re incredibly powerful .
the first thing you see in the most of the time is the terrible force of the world &apos;s .
he &apos;s carrying it up to my leg , picks me up , brings me up to a vehicle and can bring me to a doctor .
it was a depression in the ground .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about them . &quot;
we have calculate that 200 years of the end of our direct are the world &apos;s end .
it &apos;s so simple to see technology as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect to the information of technology .
it &apos;s the most important of my favorite system .
i &apos;d like to think -- thank you .
and i can assure you : corn is in everything .
you should know that in every community , the number of the world &apos;s number is already increasing .
i led three main years to antarctica .
but tell me where they are and what country they are . &quot;
we also explored the surface of the islands -- a very important thing for birds , one of the most important things in the pacific .
and we &apos;re the rest of the world in front of a problem .
he coined the term &quot; reverse fishing . &quot;
of course , the most of the time , the most of the time , and the open seas , but the most of the time that everybody likes to look at , was in trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific , with huge amounts of water and huge .
now there &apos;s a lot of the time , immediate , automatic , automated , free about many of our devices , even on the smartphone .
it &apos;s a endless debate and there &apos;s no conclusions , no answer to it , but if you &apos;re a geek like me , you say , &quot; well , what are the data ? &quot;
instead , he &apos;s very carefully documented , which is always happening again when technology is going to be the first time in a environment and in a community .
so there &apos;s , of course , two different possibilities .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a yves painting painting .
i mean , that was at least how it did me happy .
now , there was a question of course , which is a while to me in the head of a while , well , can i do more from the things i like to do in design , and less of those who i don &apos;t like to do ?
and here it is from front of the front .
they &apos;re a terrible situation without the way to do it .
they &apos;re going to be scanned in hospitals .
as a 15-year-old , for example , i was considered an extraordinary gifted in the world &apos;s , because i knew the most of the time i &apos;ve got to use the most of the time , and i can work with the most of the time .
i &apos;ve seen this value of older people in so many of my friends who are in their 60s , &apos; 70s , &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s .
as christian , and made a huge thing from the , and made out of the world &apos;s , and made young jewish men in the united states and canada , and superman , who also looked back at the bible .
the case of the world &apos;s last muslim europe &apos;s .
the biggest bad thing , the most powerful , don &apos;t want these rocks to be able to prevent them . so he tries to prevent them on the most powerful .
and one of my favorites is ct from yemen .
&quot; and when does the article come out ? &quot;
and it &apos;s got to be a little bit of the way that we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous when a group of itself identified itself as extremely .
and the most of the time .
let &apos;s look at it .
let me highlight it for you .
let me show you this .
and when i started designing with the design , i &apos;ve discovered something weird about myself .
so they have the eye and then the concepts come to it .
but of course , china has a massive population .
but what that shows is that this kind of visualization is a form of information .
it &apos;s even a pleasure to be able to deal with them , because they &apos;re visual .
the most important thing is called the eden project in britain .
why don &apos;t it smell like the eyeballs or a water system ? so there are two theories .
and a theory allows a less to work .
now after some months of the ride , i discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule that you call a kind of molecule , and that &apos;s exactly the same vibration .
that &apos;s the basis for the device that built these two people from ford .
they made it -- and it &apos;s made it smell exactly like coumarin .
that was a good thing .
and at the time , a series of things are going to be done in the way that i want to pay them attention .
and she actually didn &apos;t have a idea of the context of the context that she landed .
norman !
i didn &apos;t say anybody on goodbye , neither of my mother , nor my father , not my sister , my brother , my ministers , my grandparents , my grandparents , my grandparents , no .
i reports of it . i reports for it , just to say that i had two things when i left the orphanage i wanted to do .
and this is how we &apos;re looking for them .
and then you hope that one of us are going to walk around and find small parts .
he had a little bit of a sudden and therefore , so he has to be authentic from other female , female and probably a lot smaller family to reach his age of 12 years .
is that a good evolutionary adaptation or will it lead to that we will be the goddess of the planet that exists on earth &apos;s planet ?
but will we do that or will we take nature to their run ?
one day , a few weeks or maybe a year later , i was with my favorite school in a store for a time . i wanted to buy a little bit of a sudden .
that meant a fundamental change for me .
my hint : about 70 layers of this , take a little bit of the time , the most of the time .
you know , how obsessed i really am ? this project is just for me , and yet i went to ebay , a chinese newspaper from 1991 to buy the bird .
when we &apos;re going to the way to the spectacular blue mountains in the west of sydney , it was a perfect amount of energy : sunlight , the smell of the smell and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you &apos;re ever going to walk again , just with a computer . &quot;
i remember that my father has taken me out in the wheelchair , and i was from up to the top and felt the sun on my face .
they told me , &quot; we &apos;ll put you next to them , because we think that &apos;s good for you . &quot;
she was able to me the phone phone and i called the school teacher , i &apos;m going to be able to make a difference of a book .
and i said , &quot; i said , &quot;
and mom and dad ? were never up .
i &apos;m in this world , but i &apos;m working in loud .
it &apos;s like a kind of a computer &apos;s disease of a richard serra .
how to hell , i want to do a phone in three weeks , if i have this stuff over millions of years ?
each of these elements could be on the wall than a kind of object .
in his days , he was the highest most famous in british .
i look at a single bit of a sudden and how they flow -- like they expand and flow . it &apos;s based on furniture , but it &apos;s not the most of the most powerful . it &apos;s been published .
that &apos;s the car of the future . it &apos;s a water .
if you put it next to contemporary architecture , it feels totally , of course .
that &apos;s my studio . it &apos;s cape .
it was made out of kevlar .
and after i did my dr. , i had lucky to be a member of a computer who used him to explore the ocean .
there was one of these most of the things .
he uses red bioluminescence like a computer &apos;s , a little bit of a sudden to animals that are blind to animals that are blind to red light and can see it without being seen .
so they use it to find it and find partners .
i challenge you to call a different science that uses still hundreds of years old technology .
this is a magical place .
so i made myself feel the value of sleep .
and at the fifth of june , in 1995 , i heard a loud bang on the disk , which changed my life and finished a duck .
and here are the duck again .
after the price , my life changed .
another example of the effects of the effects of the birds are on the lives of birds .
so , if i do something like this -- this is the sound for purple .
depending on how i &apos;m going to be able to hear it , i can hear music with the food .
one of them is &quot; i have a dream &quot; by martin luther king , and the other is from hitler .
now , you can see more often that former general is now the most important ones .
you don &apos;t want to say anything about it , that could be used against a . &quot;
absolutely essential .
and what happens when teachers want order ?
and why not ? they don &apos;t trust the law . why don &apos;t they trust the law ?
because it &apos;s so that freedom has a structure of structure .
because life is complex . and here &apos;s the hardest and biggest change : we need to have the authority for the interpretation and application of law and the officer .
a free society needs red and green lights , otherwise it will be a lot of a mess .
put boundaries for the interest , calculate the most important and to the educated , which you can take .
well , if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard to be a ruler with a ruler .
he had paid a very bad job .
he had only one of the things that he had last one .
but the problem , to leave rules and incentives , is that they &apos;re expanding the age of the age of the age . and they &apos;re breaking the age of the age of two .
so smart , smart , are better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that some smart is going to be upright for unlimited time .
why has this idea spreading ?
people want to be able to be a lot of people .
it was an extraordinary time . i &apos;m going to light the mentality , which we &apos;re doing -- america and the rest of the world -- then .
this was a little bit of the turtle , the turtle .
we have to do it with a complete kind of thing .
what i want to show you is what you need to transport 34 pounds up .
what would have been if they had had nuclear weapons ?
we come down and bring the truck to just see them somewhere in the most of the time .
part of the problem is that the most powerful self is the idea of a nuclear disaster .
it was sent to me by somebody who &apos;s a computer &apos;s favorite of the most of the time . the fact is that america had hard .
there are many black sheep out there , which is the wrong things , and the problems have more reduced .
we can show our results . we can make things better .
how can we tap them into it ?
it &apos;s a dangerous working system to have a dangerous education system .
imagine we could , because if we could , we could achieve more .
governments who are most progress are governments who have found ways to allow shared value to business , rather than seeing the government who has the unique say .
maybe i can cut here , i &apos;m going to look at the brain , and i can change my cut .
i want to zoom in .
come on a moment with me , right , in the 19th century , right to the 24 century .
we could certainly be all so productive if facebook or twitter wouldn &apos;t cost us so much time .
they &apos;re looking down to the british government to get money for building babbage &apos;s machines , because they believed that these machines would have enormous practical effects for society .
these benefits didn &apos;t just weigh less wealthy men , but they also were upset about the most vulnerable to look at the most difficult questions , rather than just answer the question .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i learned something about life .
if you start looking at the very small things -- this person wrote a whole article and said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and all of the old enough , they don &apos;t know how these infection happened -- which is by these two .
there are about 10,000 programs .
this would be the frequency in the you can find every 26 letters of the minimum in a random of random monkeys .
everywhere life is , you will have this distribution , unlike this distribution .
too hot , too hot .
the officer asks , &quot; are you sure ? hey , buddy , are you sure you lost that ? &quot;
these are the data of a single survey to the most of a survey in zambia , from a few years ago , which i have been a few years ago .
as you see , bruce serra had a lot more hair at the time .
you could talk about 10,000 , 20,000 or 30,000 dollars , if i had time or it was in my plan , and i &apos;m not just in vacation .
instead of teaching people how to put the forms on the mobile phones , we should develop software that allows them to do that without practice and without my favorite .
that &apos;s less than i was traveling to the first time i traveled to two weeks as a consultants .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , in life or the balloon , we need to change the height .
that can be in the spirituality .
and that &apos;s why they need weather weather .
i promised me to go the next time i would fly around the world , not going to take fuel , regardless of fossil , to be safe , not being threatened by the most threatened .
i think they need a pilot in the plane , to talk to the universities , to talk to politicians , with politicians , and it can really make a human adventure .
and what is the goal ?
that &apos;s why all people who believe that they &apos;re going to believe that they &apos;re going to be part of these teams .
now , you just need a laptop .
anyway , for us , africa was a magical place .
the next thing i want to do is create clarity , what this problem is and what it is .
that &apos;s crazy , really , if you think about it .
let &apos;s stop a second with the nonsense .
the fact is that we can see the first generation , and this extreme poverty in the eyes can see , you see it and you have to do it .
it &apos;s going to be on the nerves .
this year is a test for us , especially for the leaders of the sacramento states , which are launched and the internet looks .
people find that slowly .
and with this one campaign as our screen , my organization , data , and other groups are the energy and the enthusiasm of there from hollywood to the other of america .
: step for step , you go forward , a nurse , a teacher , a long , and life is saved .
the idea that the internet has changed that all of their lives has changed , a country can change -- and a continent of it is just to be made to the analog .
lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
now , their job is to see what this shapes is , and what kiki .
now , if you &apos;re not just going to be a lot of the time , this sentence , literally , is wrong .
if we solve a problem or discover something new , we compare that to what we know , with what &apos;s unknown to us .
nadia godin : i &apos;m glad to be here .
they don &apos;t fit to all these representations .
pm : i don &apos;t think that .
how are they going to handle them , personally , but also with their own ?
some of my reporters were arrested .
that &apos;s clearly a different picture of yemen .
my heart was three times too big .
this is a list of the side effects : if you eat too much salt like a lot of salt and a sandwich , you probably land on the intensive care .
but soon , i showed symptoms for the most important and i had to go back to the ted process , and i had to see that i would never see my home again .
i sat there and i talked about the most excited for the most amazing thing for transplants and asked him what i would , if i needed a transplant , to prepare me .
i was at a dozen machines who thought that i was alive .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these most of the things that are also published in the united states is also published in the u.s.
and also , interesting , the same company that sold us to the 80 million pounds of atrazine , the &quot; the &quot; the antidote to the antidote to the antidote to the antidote to the same . &quot;
we also launched as a kind of a time .
what would our kids say to us when they go back to a child , and i had a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bit of artificial a.
the problem is that you &apos;re in my village , oakland , in most of our villages don &apos;t see these connection .
here you see the accumulation of the accumulation of the way to los angeles next to los angeles .
i offered five cents for every single time .
the most of the time can &apos;t be wolfgang , it &apos;s become global .
here you see , in red , the spread of the world &apos;s prevalence .
they &apos;re like a mouse that looks at the foot of a elephant , and the largest part of them remains them .
they look from their tree tree and they &apos;re coming from all directions around us .
redwoods have a huge surface that expands in the sky because they tend to do something called repetition .
and the redwood is the redwood stability , just like a cathedral , and help the tree , longer to live .
it &apos;s absolutely a little bit of a sudden to see .
but recently , all doors are going to be put in the palace of the palace and break the walls .
that was 25 years ago .
let &apos;s first look at the first time the most of the time .
how do these people do with these infected computers ?
and you can see it to see how we work -- how security security -- and try to find a way to deal with the most of the time we meet .
you &apos;ll notice that you can see a little bit down there , you can see a little bit of a sudden , and you can see , you know , the bottom of the street , and if you open this image image on your computer , this program will downloaded and managed to do it .
and if you look at the images of the scene , you can see that the gut of the country is the kind of the accumulation of the iceberg .
we need to find any way to make sure that everything is playing , even though the computer is going to be .
but i don &apos;t have to do anything with that .
this person is using the consultants .
why should we believe what he says ? &quot;
how does his future look like ?
these powers are completely disappearing , nobody &apos;s going to be 2011 .
it would be good if people were more , and they would take a serious thing , and they would be able to participate and participate because this would change things . but it would change things on two main ways .
that means that we have a copy of self , if they used to use one part of the most of the most of the most of the time , and it &apos;s a worse thing that has been a worse and worse and more powerful .
and the happy few , jill and kevin ? well , they came back from their own and saw that their video had suddenly spread like a computer .
thank you !
you &apos;re going to go to the distance .
that &apos;s what was taught to do it since he was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had a mentor like figuring out how to do the surface of the ocean .
what is it going to be driving you in life today ? not 10 years ago .
what do you do with what you &apos;re doing and you happen to happen ?
didn &apos;t have the -- time . didn &apos;t have the -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager .
in this moment , aware or unconscious . in the moment you decide to focus on something , you can get a meaning and whatever it means , it makes feelings .
have you ever done what , and you &apos;re going to go , &quot; that was me ! &quot;
to death , so , god in his infinite wisdom , gave us another human need : the uncertainty .
but that &apos;s true : we need it . we can do it through intimacy , through friendship , through prayers , through the movements in nature .
and there are seven different beliefs . i can &apos;t go through it because i &apos;m through . the last element is feeling .
jewish man with family in the stairwell , somebody in new york , who died when he was working on the day , and this man , who wanted to be a terrorist and it said .
instead , i &apos;m interested in developing tools , with a big number of people who can tell their stories everywhere , people around the world .
the color of particles is the way that the particles of feeling -- happy , positive feelings have shining colors .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was all day at the computer . &quot;
and if i go over here , the list starts to walk , and there are thousands of feelings that were collected .
the 10 themes of rays and circle the time .
it &apos;s called &quot; universe : unveiling our modern mythology . &quot;
we can click that and see this iconic picture of betty ford , like she was photographing the shortest of her husband .
you can also look at quotes if you want to read quotes to climate change .
so people feel in clouds as something that is in ways .
in life , they started to live tens of thousands of members in almost 100 countries around the earth .
they just need a step out to go out , and to notice that so common , so common is that all the other it is missing .
so look up , admire the appropriate beauty , and you always think about it , to wear the head in the clouds .
the 25,000 recordings would have put 25,000 recordings that would have done this : &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot;
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the most of the time to buy my first favorite . it was a huge machine .
these footage comes from a virtual autopsy .
here you can see how knives is going to be in the heart .
it &apos;s a little mechanical pen that has been built in his inner very , very fast shrimp .
this is a really interesting project now .
so he does .
so , very talented people .
i went to the kids so often as possible as possible to bring the academic stuff with the real world in connection .
it &apos;s not all , but it &apos;s an incredibly powerful summary of everything we know about the basics of nature .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details , why we &apos;re going to imagine the universe so that we &apos;re going to imagine the universe , but it &apos;s trying to explain physics that we know .
but over my career , i always call a little bit of a little bit in me .
in 2001 , i went to her while a computer .
we got a lot of self-worth .
this is the first degree of the year in 2004 .
he &apos;s just filmed the most short and was filmed with someone who &apos;s all familiar with .
every one is going to have a built-in system , but it &apos;s based on different scientific disciplines .
i have my first computer as a teenager in favor and it was a real great device .
he &apos;s exploring the brain using mri and he said that this is the most beautiful brain that he ever introduced .
on the next few slides , i &apos;m going to explain that briefly .
transistors are going to be smaller to allow and make our technology better .
our favorite system is behind this lens .
i had a gut gut , that we &apos;re wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so we know what a schwarzschild radius is .
i like to call them the most important of the most of the time , because they &apos;re kind of a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of thing .
we can see more detail in our galaxy , as somewhere else .
and that brings us a factor of 20th .
so there was a bunch of alternatives to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff there .
it &apos;s a lot stronger than the other and the cloud will be made apart .
and i hope i &apos;ve got them convinced at least that we have a really supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy .
one day i was in the streets of new york , and i saw some kids between the line , cars and fire fire .
so for example , people liked pieces of pieces that ended up so that .
in the first eight centuries of this tradition , this tradition was about the great thing , &quot; what &quot; do god do .
through new and improved instruments , the age of the ham is .
but a question is , what happens when the music stops ?
michael : thomas : music and feelings in the course of time
so we &apos;re at the beginning of a new health .
until the year 1945 , they brought it to 100,000 year .
so i &apos;m going to talk about the way i don &apos;t know where i should start .
wow , a volunteer , great !
but recently , my interest was done by a new view of big , and there &apos;s a big view of the big , because there &apos;s a really cool thing to do .
well , i think this is the latest development of a phenomenon that we call &quot; procedures innovation . &quot;
but the element of desire is really the most important thing .
we get a lot of talk about them .
let me introduce you to this point sam .
but even if you &apos;re going to get the screen time , you &apos;re sent a lot more than words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge online and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
as a global world , innovation is affected .
first , i have to turn a service of the audience &apos;s audience and talk about what i &apos;m going to give him , instead of saying what i can &apos;t offer .
and that they &apos;re fun to design their own ultimate , ultimate or worst tedtalk .
well , you can &apos;t compare them to each other .
they hold them alive and they give them the sugar , so a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of thing that we call superpower .
this kind of tests are going to make this cause , ok ?
somebody asked &quot; why ? &quot;
the thought he could reverse the waves . couldn &apos;t he .
i think there are three big changes , and that &apos;s where transparency and accountability , where people have a real power .
how do we do that ?
my favorite , sharon , sharon , said , all over the world , exist more photos of your head than each other .
11 of 14 countries .
and secondly , teachers looked at the most important and they were a statement , and they were a statement , because they took a specific sense of specific areas in which a computer is a sense of sense .
so i then wish all of a weekend .
dna to read and write , will always easier and cheaper .
each other alone .
now you might ask yourself , &quot; what would i do in a computer system ? &quot;
if you have all the world , it can lead to a computer , which is allowed to do biotechnology .
the kingdom said , his laws allow him to make strangers , or a half , the economic risk or a risk of health care or the values of the state .
these laws are a blow into the face for science and based on prejudice and ignorance and a representation of traditions and a selective .
why are you going to be pregnant when you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of 10 hiv people who inject drugs .
so social beings , the condoms , are tracking condoms , not even the police , they &apos;re going to be tracking or randomly , or are they going to be locked in .
here were kids born , people died there .
office for personal work are now obsolete .
they &apos;ve got the high line , the street , the river , the river below the street , and you get from a end of the end to the other , without cross the most of the time .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny apartments . &quot;
jobs should be shared .
your liver makes the military oil .
and they killed the 12,000 sharks at the time by doing just a little bit of the time of the most of the time in the world &apos;s bay bay .
we know very little about them .
so this tag finds the place of a shark , depending on time and the sunset , the water and deep .
let &apos;s look at the width of what to do with the genes that are passed from the parents , we see that basking sharks , compared to the first study , have a factor of 10 less diversity than others .
so , these research were a research and found that the size is the earliest .
and what was okay . we were wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build . &quot;
so if we can see the gender of the shark before we take a sample , we can say , &quot; if you take a sample or females . &quot;
so i decided to give myself the temptation .
their bodies are going to be broken with the most powerful and they &apos;re determined for any of the most of the things to make money -- people tell themselves a lot of these stories .
no business with no no .
my journalism may not fit on other continents or in other countries , but in my part of africa , it works . is it about corruption , questions that people are immediately : &quot; where are the evidence ?
aa thank you .
i was raised in downtown manhattan in downtown manhattan , two blocks away from the most of the time .
i wouldn &apos;t read as a kind of was reading .
and had these people ever realized a victim of their own ?
today , you can be in 29 states , in more than half of the country , because of its sexuality , because of his sexuality .
eventually , i realized that my mission is &quot; gay &quot; to photograph , because there was a million different of the gay ones .
at least i hope that it &apos;s harder to get your human rights .
first , the world is , and it &apos;s always good and evil , because good and evil , yin and yang are the most important .
and third , i had access to all 1,000 pictures that had done the soldiers .
on three ways , the conventional way is called the conventional way .
this is stanley milgram , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he said , &quot; could the holocaust happen , here and now ? &quot;
&quot; my lord , who is responsible when it happens to him ? &quot;
stanley milgram and i closed both of 1954 , by the way , the high school , at james &apos;s bronx .
here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
the other thing . the other thing .
alexander &apos;s &quot; says that the border between good and evil through the heart of a human .
and i hired the experiment on the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what everybody could do , &quot; no big thing to jump on .
it &apos;s a mystery that was really hard to do .
we have a self .
but on my left retina , a little bit of a sudden , which is made by the red arrow .
there &apos;s only one reference , which is the body .
i promise that i don &apos;t say that i &apos;m not going to say it &apos;s supposed to be a lot of it .
and the autobiographical self has extended memory , think of creativity and language .
thank you . thank you for the 50th prize -- and kary hill .
now i &apos;m telling you this -- i tell you , and i &apos;m ridiculous to make sure , &quot; feminism , &quot; partly the task , i think , is the aesthetic , and beauty and fun .
we don &apos;t want a hero .
you can have a guess , i don &apos;t have myself in fire .
she talked about the most about the time , she started , she was organized , she was organized , she &apos;s organized , she &apos;s organized friends -- all these daily actions of care and creativity .
i mean , it &apos;s that perception that is different to be different to the homo sapiens of former .
in fact , this is a sensor for realizing that read the electric activity in my brain while i think this talk .
we &apos;re going to be a lot of prototypes and products to live with thoughts that can control with thoughts like voyager appliances , or a floating chair .
the headset is connected to a ipad or smartphone .
as these kids can use their new consciousness to their recovery , many of the harmful and the social of social beings turn to the world &apos;s own , which are people who are diagnosed with themselves .
they understood the power of human narrative and that the value we &apos;re doing on people &apos;s , changes , and growing up .
and said , &quot; how do you celebrate ? &quot;
my skills and my possibilities .
stick , and it &apos;s unexpected , they gave them .
this is not what this one was holding to study my eyes .
i went to a track that i know good .
and , very slowly , it happened .
i didn &apos;t really believe myself , not really , not all the stocks of me , all the little people in all of us .
that &apos;s me . my whole i .
what we have is exactly the same thing that &apos;s the same activity , but it &apos;s feeling great , and in the other , with just one small change in the posture , they feel terrible .
but i think it &apos;s another debate that needs to be the place that we have to control about control of control .
for the other hand , you could have install the money in the trains , which wouldn &apos;t have reduced the duration of the journey , but what the pleasure and the caucasus would have improved .
i &apos;m not asking to the complete stock engine of one about the other .
sometimes the lines are very , very long .
i think the danger in the world is that the field of economics as a discipline is understood as a discipline of economics .
would have been the average answer to 50 to 60 percent .
it &apos;s going to be a lot of the time that they don &apos;t even get themselves to hurt others .
yay !
they &apos;re 20 , 30 years back .
but that doesn &apos;t mean i have a coin with head on both sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but that &apos;s our skin of the visible universe .
thank you .
with hyperscore , we had fair , actually , very strong effects in children , and now in humans , every age .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful for life forever .
hello . my name is dan &apos;s favorite , i &apos;m 34 years old and have cerebral lanes .
this is actually the score of dan &apos;s piece that he wrote completely in hyperscore .
odysseus would have said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do a little bit of a time .
there &apos;s first time the present self .
i have to write five pages a day for articles , or i had to give five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that today &apos;s going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you is the last two of the world &apos;s past , is something i &apos;ve created with hal , which was introduced to me from my co-author at a previous project , bill .
it &apos;s pretty good that it &apos;s not about the people , because if one of the faces smiles , the other face is going to be officially .
this is one of the reasons that so much of what we &apos;re doing for western science , math and the most important thing was , in the first few centuries of our world &apos;s disease , and the most of the time .
x is the unknown , because there &apos;s no &quot; sh &quot; .
so , it doesn &apos;t mean that if you talk about mental illness , you probably hear stories of the suffering , shame and discrimination in almost all life lives .
something more than 30 years ago , the nations were going to be in the world in the world , and gave these legendary explanation .
what does it go ?
if you look at the level of species , you &apos;ve heard about the fish .
you look at this profit , you see that almost 8,000 of these dollars are actually subsidies .
that was in the early massacre , as india wanted to be driving -- as a tool to the ground -- after china with his 0.1 growth of eight , nine , 10 percent looked at and asked himself , why can &apos;t we ?
it &apos;s not that it &apos;s going to be able to be able to do it , but they have trust and the courage , and they &apos;re , &quot; we &apos;ve calculate .
green carbon , so the emissions emissions through deforestation and agriculture , and blue carbon together are 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it to win .
i didn &apos;t know what these things are deeply , thick , not -- sydney also didn &apos;t .
i also liked these intellectual types of energy .
and he said he was essentially the same relationship to his father .
there was a theory .
he did it in 1968 .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t move in the course of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed the whole thing , and the most of the color , which just hidden fantastic aluminum aluminum aluminum .
many of these ideas are going to be in the trailer to airstream a coma .
if you think about it , your children are going to send the tinkering school , you &apos;ll come back with the most floating school , you &apos;ll come back with the most of the time .
but let &apos;s play them under their own conditions and trust me , they &apos;re going to learn things that they can &apos;t learn from the most of the time .
if you want to throw away a device next time , you don &apos;t do it .
i think that &apos;s all . that &apos;s number five . okay .
so here you see the sick knee on the left , and here &apos;s my wife at the end of the face today , four months after , in aspen , and in good constitution .
how about a completely more powerful thing , not just the parts of the parts ?
that &apos;s one of the seven more existing things that were not shot in all .
and so it came up with the years of risk of risk , to buy thousands of , then thousands of thousands and finally millions of individual , smaller paper , which should bring a middle of hell in the sky .
but how does our imagination work ?
but we never think about the hidden connections .
as a edison the light bulb invented , she saw about this .
you have to be quite smart , and even though i don &apos;t have a college , it doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m stupid because you can &apos;t be stupid today and bring it into the world .
they literally have the door to us .
if you listen to the most powerful , you listen to your own ears both , both ears .
we have the problem that antenna is increasing .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and the most important thing .
recently , i &apos;ve created some pretty sophisticated things from the most sophisticated , and i &apos;ve created some pretty sophisticated .
and i drew for every person your own special map and wrote your name on it , you &apos;re going to marry them and sent them .
i &apos;m sure i can see how you &apos;re going to be .
and i &apos;m convinced that it &apos;s a lot of the time that it &apos;s a lot of valuable , valuable and limited life on this earth .
in this mode , he tries to keep his position .
i thought i &apos;m telling you a little bit about how nature creates materials .
we &apos;re going to think about future technologies . we start at the beginning of the world .
and if you see it , you see the amino acids with the most of the amino acids that you have different charges .
and through a sequence of the world &apos;s series , you can get one of a billion fish that you want to grow , for example , a battery or a solar cell .
in this case , you see the most important thing .
if you ask people the question , where do you go to do something important if you have something important ?
i sat on my desk , i &apos;ve used my expensive computer .
what happens -- sometimes you have these days , where you wake up with eight o &apos;clock in the morning , or you &apos;re going to get up , and you say , &quot; man , i don &apos;t really sleep good .
in the office , most of the things are the most respected and distractions that people actually hold from work , they &apos;re going to be careful .
we all know that this is true . they would never experience a spontaneous meeting that from employees .
meetings and managers are the two main problems in companies today , especially in offices .
maybe all two weeks , or every week , once the week , the week , i &apos;m going to talk to you .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m doing this now seven years and have no idea how the future is going to look like .
but if you ask people to ask the three most important things that they carry in , no matter what gender and what context -- most people say , key , money , and if you have one , the mobile phone .
but , and this is a very big but , we have the tendency to forget .
well , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
they take 10 or 20 percent of the world &apos;s and then -- the owner of the rape takes 10 or 20 percent of the time , and there &apos;s the rest of the whole amount of bars in my family .
it challenges the norm .
and he somehow has a recognition for the values of the aerodynamic .
at the same time , the spread of these mobile devices are we see a expectation of availability .
our present reality is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell you about earlier .
what do we talk about ?
dean ornish : sharing new research , which shows how the oecd of healthy lifestyles can affect people to genetic level . he says that if we live healthier , studies and more love to be able to do our brain cells .
until i tell you who said it said .
within this context , we can actually feel regret about many different things .
when i went home , after i had my tattoo , i stayed almost the night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s another fifth .
i mean , even the dumb answer to all the answer to all the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer &quot; can let us go back days .
and as i used to say , i &apos;m a little bit of a time .
i thought i would try to do my ted wish , which i &apos;m trying to do , and how to do that , what they &apos;re trying to do .
no india . now , at least one million active active .
and i came up with the idea that someone in this whole world must think about the organization of the organization .
and so we did that to do that .
listen to that : less than four tenth of one percent of those who were treated , the principal would be treated , or the caregiver of their medicines .
it &apos;s a try and i think it would be successful .
the stretch are not square .
if the automobile is used , it will create 8,000 watts of electricity . day and night .
and people bring their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , with the green school .
the more unhealthy women from bali cook is eating food on the ground and they use secrets that only know their grandmothers .
we need somebody who comes and studied that .
the green school is a model that we built for the world .
my tongue , voice and vocal vocal , were healthy and not motivated . &quot;
then apple alex brought out the best voice i had heard .
there was a reason for that : i was .
the most of the time is not .
but that &apos;s not what it is .
at first , the internet was a tool for me , and now it &apos;s something i &apos;m going to leave for my real , daily life .
&quot; it &apos;s human , disease .
they all know the test for artificial intelligence , the test test .
i was an architect before , and my grandmother asked me , &quot; what do you live ? &quot;
we treat two of the pages of pages as a single side , because it &apos;s true , it &apos;s true .
so what is the lesson behind ?
but one day , my grandmother said , &quot; no , you &apos;re going to run it .
it happened and terrible things happened with me .
all the hope in my healing .
so they went to their own and all collected their furniture furniture -- they gave me a hint and the most of the time , and they were doing everything .
you don &apos;t know how far away this road is and you don &apos;t know if you go straight and hear cars and you had a terrible accident that you &apos;ve got in this situation .
i thought that some reason are the time , and only for family and friends .
for example , the understanding molecular structures .
he took me to the most of the time of the world &apos;s favorite .
can we argue we could have discovered all the symmetries of the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t turn it out because i have a little bit of a professional degree , right ?
if i turn a magic move , and then one , it makes a third .
galois has set up a series of laws for how these tables , these symmetries , interact .
one such symmetry we call a symmetry .
instead of all the mess call , i want to know how many digits have the number . ok ?
i need your last name . symmetrical objects basically have -- please spell it for me .
first , worse diet , maybe shorter of the .
thomas edison would have been very much more powerful in software software today .
penicillin was discovered in the developed , but even 1940 , no commercial and lower amounts of it .
it was the origin of the world &apos;s origin , the last year his 50th birthday .
for me , the lesson is of unintended consequences that chaos is now happening . let &apos;s do the best thing .
works in every computer and browser . minus , minus , minus and the text is going to be smaller .

and this cell is one of the thousand different types of different , which we learn .
it will affect the healthy circuits as the sick that they want to fix .
and one morning in summer , we tried it and it &apos;s been working on the first time .

all these empty areas , the areas that the phone phone came through .
and the nature of a particular cell , to basically make a help , is that it &apos;s determined to be the 25,000 genes on what the 25,000 genes are turned on and what the threshold they are on .
now experts come into play and make basic signs of the place .
we take the difference material and put it on a so-called called a so-called a .
so what can scientists learn from these data ?
they look at their entire genomes and they try to find the most important thing to be connected to the genes .
whether that depends on individual genetic background or your experience , we don &apos;t know .
that we know how to eradicate poverty , we just need to do more for it ?
so here &apos;s a few more questions .
how can you know ?
so what is the problem ?
well , before it was all right .
and it was made many experiments that all came to the same outcome , so i &apos;m just going to tell you about one .

with 16 , the kids have to leave the orphanage , although they &apos;re often not able to do anything .
one of the interesting things is , of course , the combination of naked hand on the instrument and technology , and of course , what he &apos;s saying about listening to our young people .

and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
from him , the sound comes through the chamber .
or we do this and believe that &apos;s what blindness is .
rain . not bad . not bad .
individual skins . but why can &apos;t i do that if i learn a piece of music ?
in this case , the dove shows the dove evelyn , evelyn ghonim , why that &apos;s listening to music much more than sound sound on its eardrum .
and it became so big until the point where it was a computer last year at the point of nerve , and rick &apos;s favorite and &quot; the &quot; millions of people in television . &quot;

bad news for derartu tulu , but some other parts had the same idea , underneath the olympic , and paula radcliffe , who is an incredibly , very much , with the fastest of all time .
show me a animal with a little bit of the time and gills , then it has something to do with water .

monster is very , very bad .
the remote remote was a experimenter from our group , where they used three different technologies to interact with the participants .
and with this technology , you can become so active in your grandchildren , in a way , like it &apos;s not possible today .
and the third possibility was a simple diary with paper and pen , because that &apos;s the most important thing you usually use when you start a computer and sport .
another important idea is this idea of the most important thing of the character .
i have style , laugh , and i &apos;m really hard to get out of it because it &apos;s not going to be , but it &apos;s going to be a third of the n .
it &apos;s going to go away , it &apos;s not far . i &apos;m fire : &quot; bang ! &quot;
if he wrote on a computer &apos;s computer , i was before the door .
i &apos;m going to show a number of photographs and movies , but i also do a little bit of a bit of advertising , books and a little bit of advertising , all with the same concept .
from photography , this is going to be a lot of the time , you &apos;re going to enjoy desire and you can &apos;t have a desire . what you can &apos;t have , you want to do more .
as you &apos;re going to be in the collective consciousness , without that we know that , and how that happens .
it &apos;s very commercial .

85 percent of global health &apos;s global health disease is in developing countries -- not in the west -- and yet 90 percent of the resources are in the west .
just treat . look at the situation in mauritius .
but if you tell that , so we &apos;re trying to make the same in nigeria , then all the fort .

autism has a very large range , from very massive -- the child doesn &apos;t evolve language -- until too brilliant scientists and engineers .
i &apos;m going to love the film , as you all have my projects , and that &apos;s the youth in me .
well , what i learned early is because i wasn &apos;t so social to sell my work and not myself .
another thing is the sensory problems .
with other words , a problem with the equipment of a computer system .
the movie in the movie is called the ted .
i made a little bit of the time during the receiver , and i built things and learned how to do tasks .
another very much idea is to teach the kids of some of the many of the many people &apos;s s / em / 7 .
tg : i have passion for that , that things i do , the world i do .
it &apos;s a extended reality , the projections are tracking and connect systems , or just a digital storyteller .
the fifth time i stand on this coast , the native of the world &apos;s , i look out on the far horizon and believe that i &apos;m going to do it all over the way , dangerous wild of a ocean .
but it was deeper : how much life is there ?
and then there &apos;s our favorite , that you never really say , how far it is , we don &apos;t know how far it is .
but very honest : all these talk that i had to perceive , just to survive the most different , they were very different .
thank you very much and fun on the conference .
and that &apos;s perhaps the most the most the time , he lost his self-worth .
he &apos;s going to take the army . the army gives him a rifle .
so , what happens when a medium suddenly brings many new ideas in circulation ?
they had to expand , which was other philosophers knew , otherwise you couldn &apos;t lead the right way of discussion .
but there was a programmer that decided that that wasn &apos;t the best kind of work .
everybody from them can do changes and they can summarize them to the work of the work , even though they didn &apos;t know about the existence of the existence .
this is called &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot;
something more significant , which can happen to a culture , is that you can acquire a new kind of new , more powerful , and you can acquire , right ? right ?
don &apos;t try to do what other things do , a little bit better , because it doesn &apos;t get very far .
and if you say somebody says you can &apos;t , you don &apos;t hear it .
six to nine months to the usual time .
but we &apos;ve tested this rover for a time before we &apos;re there -- or this one rover -- and have sure that everything works .
so we sent a zero-sum forest on the way to mars , called phoenix . this probe is going to land in 17 days , seven hours and 20 seconds , so you can ask your clocks .
and that would be bad .
we &apos;re , while we &apos;re talking to you , the next rover we want to send to mars .
and i know many of you have thought that these jets are really cool things .
there were two satellites that are particularly interested in us .
it &apos;s like the cycle of the cycle on earth , but because it &apos;s so cold , it can &apos;t be water , because water would be frozen .
today i want to talk about how these exponentially are growing technologies .
so let &apos;s look at exponentially growing technology that affects health care .
this is an example of this kind of thing .
there &apos;s wireless scales .
and i think many of these technologies are going to help us be connected to our patients and take more time to take us on the important , human elements of medicine that are going to be expanding by this kind of technology .
the current trend in medicine is to become exponentially smaller .
come on to genomics , as a decade ago , the first human being did the first human being , was the cost of a billion dollars .
thanks to the very websites of the way , like a , or the data , of course , is the data on the ground , or google health , it will always be more important , all these possibilities on a computer way .
we used the cells from the bone marrow to treat a patient with heart attacks , we realized a better deal of the body , and higher amounts of water that &apos;s going to be caused by the heart attack .
my poem is called &quot; dirt . &quot;
their cats , god knows how many , the ones on their own account , their acres , a sense of smell .

i was afraid , a part of me would be part of me except control and i would be caught for the shocking of your favorite system .
but i &apos;m afraid that the fact that the world &apos;s coming from and i &apos;ll show you his own .
if we love , they hold me around , i &apos;m there , i &apos;m there .
we &apos;re looking for images that are falling attention to critical topics , images that are the religions , to cross images , images that are going to be the other way to do with other words .
in &apos; 80s , the stigma was an enormous obstacle with this disease , and they &apos;re also telling them to discuss this disease or also mention them .
jonathan klein : photos that changed the world
i had read a lot of books , and i studied the way i studied it and studied and forth .
i could see myself , like i put the flag on the stick , well , ah , a moment , and the music was called a little bit of a sudden .
finally , the morning of the world &apos;s day , we got the most the time we got the helicopter -- we &apos;re going to get the helicopter -- two helicopter in the middle of the ice .
i knew that there was more open water water , and i had a little bit of a sudden .
i had known that , but i had a little bit of expected .
this was the view of my tent , when i got this kind of day call .
and only from the air , i saw the picture .
and they were walking back and they wanted to go back to the coast , and all five died on the factor .
and that &apos;s a jewish man , so that &apos;s a lot .
but some days later , we thought we had to have our students about this , and we said , &quot; what would happen if this drunk guy didn &apos;t have been in this condition ?
one day in a few of the years of donor disasters , in one of the most remote regions of the pacific , looked at 20 american , the ship of the pacific .
but in a certain point , most of the visions of giving up the visions , and will be adult .
they have the same structure .
some of us tend to read their fears as others .
right , really read a fascinating gift of imagination , a kind of a way of looking at a look at the future , if it &apos;s time to influence your appearance .
nothing happened . no violence . nothing .
we brought them into every living room of arab world -- international , global , through our english channel .
they were separated from their people , from the masses and now we see them crash , one after the other .
thank you very much .
because we discovered that it &apos;s the people care , and people want to be informed -- they receive the most the way they were doing the internet through our internet .
and frankie said , &quot; i &apos;m as 22 on the series , and i see the needle on me , and there &apos;s blood .
you want to share a needle just as little as you want to share a toothbrush , even with someone you &apos;re doing .
so this is a picture of hundreds of studies of all the high animals in the united states , and that &apos;s the studies that are effective , quite many of them .
so you can see these awful images from africa .
now , i &apos;m saying , oh , great .
tendai is a very small on the streets of the streets , and it &apos;s a girl with tail .
she was 105 years old when i made this photograph of her .
hey , hey , black-eyed susie , hey .
and a little banjo play . here &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of a banjo .
we were with the car at the time , texas , where i spent my early childhood .
and mother was just sitting in the car .
let &apos;s try with this old song with this old song . i sing : there &apos;s a long white robe in the sky , i know .
originally , from the brothers , the brothers built the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot;
well , that &apos;s easier to say than done .
we were not stupid : we put a piece of plywood on about five feet .
when they were new , was the idea of why can &apos;t you take the oldest of the oldest , which is &quot; whistling &quot; rhythms , and you combine with the latest technology ?
well , i think it works because scientists are connected to a community .
it &apos;s significant for something that &apos;s going to show you the place in the room , because it &apos;s critical , not where other things are , but in terms of this absolute idea of space .
and in a relational universe , the only possible explanation was that it &apos;s kind of created itself .
and you understand some things better than other , and therefore there &apos;s a little bit of a sudden and give you a lot of the politics .
there &apos;s another tedsters that was talking about two years ago , jonathan haidt , who defined his work in three different levels .
and just to let everything .
while five months , he &apos;s going to experiment to experiment with a full of the whole .
that wasn &apos;t very successful . and so on and so on .
or philip glass or lou reed or the chemical brothers who have played all there , they all had their own picture de logo .
after two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .
a little bit to get a little bit of a little bit .
and it &apos;s a transition that has exactly the way to do that with the identity of living as the memory of the dead .
but the most important thing and the most of the time is the status of wealth , and the status of the deceased , and the family of the deceased .
if we could expand our definition of death to include life , we could experience death as part of our lives and maybe death with something else than fear .
i wanted to end my show with a dance ...
your talk about the water in the water , and the context that the context between darwinism and the fact that we &apos;re all naked , less , and we can swim .
ok , gordon , come on .

eight years of the u.s. history , eight minutes of my show , are just so on .
and jack is saying , &quot; i want to be a better person . &quot;
&quot; do this world to a better place when you can .
so i &apos;ll give you the message in advance : trying to be extinct .
where are the little ? &quot;
here &apos;s the people again .
how you can imagine , is it one thing , a little bit of a sudden , but if you go into a museum and say , &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter if i &apos;m going to get your favorite , right ? &quot;
and you could , you know , there &apos;s a hint of one .
so we &apos;re a lot of the time and we &apos;ve collected some and we found a lot of little animals .
so we know that amazingly is a triceratops in reality .
looks like it could even be bigger .
we wanted to make a atmospheric architecture .
all the water of the world are consumed here , so we thought that after you &apos;re on the water , it &apos;s moving through the water and breathe water , you could drink the building .
the drill was put on a 12 .
then you get up in this glass elevator in the computer &apos;s elevator .
and after that .
that &apos;s a guy from salt lake city . so that &apos;s where it looks .
&quot; drawn &quot; -- as if they were implemented , they were a little bit of a sudden .
it &apos;s not sure that it would be so moved when the editor had no woman .
by the way , wired , wired .
analyze the news , talk about , if something is missing , like that people who did the new york times .
this particular plant is breaking into the way that we &apos;re doing and other people &apos;s chemicals from the air .
m is most of the time i need to figure out the morning , if i &apos;m going to figure out what &apos;s going to happen .
and then -- remember , as a &#93; rice , was going to put on a event , and was criticized for it ?
pm : are you on resistance when you &apos;ve done this to the rationale of your foreign policy ?
when i was secretary of secretary of secretary , only 13 women were in other countries .
thank you for us today .
malaria : there are eight countries in sub-saharan africa that could reduce their death rates around 75 percent .
for the way , for the way we &apos;re a zone , it &apos;s a zone of a zone , and it &apos;s fair to say that i &apos;m sexually sexually .
to be exactly , today , in your capital , some , in those heavy times , the treasury cut and in the life-saving programs like global fund .
in the contrary , it could save a lot of life .
if we take this metaphor of a genome as a program , you have to think that chris anderson is a object , as jim watson , craig venter , and all of us .
you design something like a cell phone , and you &apos;re working in very abstract language , you &apos;re doing this cell phone .
this is normal dna , which is what you &apos;re holding for normal dna .
we heat them , add something salt , heat it almost until the most of the time , and they &apos;re going to be the short strands of coral that &apos;s the long and it &apos;s a structure .
so that &apos;s really good , and you can build patterns and also form patterns , okay ?
you &apos;re going to zoom in , there are only four strands of dna , and sit on them , and sit on them , and they &apos;re going to sit on other blocks , if they fit .

a problem with the plants of trees is that people are so poor in this region that they &apos;re more likely to be able to use trees to use them as an hour .

my argument is basically that , well , well , the most part of our lives were always part of our lives .
and that &apos;s pretty new , and i think it &apos;s going to be much worse -- this possibility -- because of the developments in technology technology , in the world &apos;s information , which can be used as biotechnology or nanotechnology .

and you have to be in all the possibilities , including that , which i &apos;ve never seen before .

people pay the full price for both , and the only thing they have in common is that they don &apos;t have anything together .
the corners of the corners , on the middle , is the big market .
these guys are asking the world &apos;s favorite system .

now , she lives in the jungle of the jungle , and that &apos;s a little bit of the time , and this is a second , your second son , by the way , the son i saved .
it was a biological desert .
then you see the returns and start measuring what comes out .

it &apos;s a digital program program in the brain and to create consciousness , we have to find the right program .
we &apos;re constantly bringing the objectivity and the most powerful as a properties of reality and as a properties of the nuclear mess .

teenagers don &apos;t wear .
maybe later , not immediately .
no , don &apos;t do it .
i could just not get this thing to work , no matter how often i &apos;m going to do it .

so i asked , &quot; what would t call the counter -- we call it a statistician , where they &apos;re increasing the impact , in the denominator -- we call it the impact ? &quot;

these kids , who were given up from all over the world , they fly from public schools , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re capable of ; with affection and sunlight and good music and confidence .
and it worked very well until today .
and i &apos;m going to allow you to take the concert , and i &apos;ll give you the music . and you should ever decide to sell them to a agreement that &apos;s used to support school . &quot;
this is a space of nancy wilson built her album in our school last christmas .
the brown building , which is what you looked at and i tell you where i made my biggest mistake .

but there was the factor of the factor , the problem with the code , and how to make cells better answers to make normal reactions , and that was our contribution .
they cover us with a invisible of the , the attacks of the environment , so we &apos;re healthy .
but if bacteria grow and double and double and involved in all of these , these molecules are rising , then the number of these molecules are accelerating outside the cell .
now we know that all bacteria can talk to each other .
that &apos;s just a photograph -- a computer &apos;s skin .
bacteria are incredibly sophisticated , which is going to be going on to kill antibiotics .
the fact is that bacteria have a collective behavior and they &apos;re never able to meet tasks that they could never do when they were just acting as individuals .
it &apos;s a big honor to me to get to this conference .
or the first one that comes into the hall .
but , if we think about justice , aristotle says that what we need to think about is the actual character of the brain activity and qualities that are worth it , and it &apos;s a lot of it .
what a reason would you have ?
charlie , what do you say to warren ?
here it is , as he &apos;s going to be .

michael sandel : the lost art of democratic argument
many people said , &quot; well , you know , you don &apos;t have to say , &quot; well , you know , we don &apos;t have to say , &quot; well , you know , we &apos;re not going to have 100 guys to say what we should start with .

if that &apos;s what that is mean for us ?
i &apos;m going to argue that the speed of the world &apos;s energy is going to be .
i &apos;m going to argue that &apos;s nonsense .
we know that there are this threshold because we don &apos;t get a commodity of a dinosaur before we get a computer age , and that &apos;s how the damage has been born since our birth .

audience : hello . i read somewhere in the last 20 years , the average lifespan of virtually every one on the planet has been spreading 10 years .
not one of their media has the job .

14 americans die per day on asthma , who are three times as much as in the &apos; 90s , and almost everything comes from the most of the time .

how do you study rap scientifically ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity that &apos;s involved in the world &apos;s .
i want to say , probabilities and statistics , that &apos;s the mathematics of games and the most important .

in your own , a very cheap blue laser .
audience : yes !
interesting is , although we have the whole time , we &apos;ve never done it , we &apos;ve never done the wings in the air .
this is the restaurant acorn house .
this is the most important that you see here , actually growing in a computer system , which was made by the outside and it was made .
so water is a more important aspect .
&quot; metal &quot; and &quot; earth &quot; are still .
the idea is not sophisticated .
they don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
once it touches the water , you should hear how air is coming out .
once we sequenced these two genomes , we asked ourselves , if this is the smallest genome of a self , it could be a little bit smaller genome ?
and the other thing that was clear was that once that worked , we would have a real chance of doing that , if we could bring the synthetic chromosomes , it &apos;s the bacteria .
so care is a little bit of care .
the last finally , a quote is a quote from robert feynman : &quot; what i can &apos;t do myself , i can &apos;t understand . &quot;
but actually , we &apos;re going to live in the northwest very close to the actual idea of paradise , which is 36 times as &quot; gardens , &quot; historically by running streams .
but the more you add , the more you seem to go .
and this number of 72 never comes .
this is a nest of a wheels colony , and that &apos;s the nest entrance .
this is a colony that has been founded by a queen in the previous summer .
the most important thing -- that &apos;s what &apos;s supposed to be a glass of glass -- are an interesting group . they go back early morning before the first group goes out .
and interestingly , it looks like that &apos;s just not what the colony colony does .
the nest maintenance workers just take all the most sacred and bring them to the edge of the brain &apos;s edge and put them there .
but the foragers are also deciding , not get rid of it .
and we did experiments that show that the longer one ant is moving out , the more the simple hydrocarbons on their surface are changing .
they &apos;re going to be the entire earth , except antarctica .
here you see that the cost of all of the cost of the world are about 89 million barrels of oil , and the annual cost of three trillion dollars .
and we do that for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
that &apos;s nothing to do with it .
i think where we can use natural gas .
and when i get to the most of the time , natural gas is nine dollars .
why don &apos;t you worry about that ?
so , just 500 million wiped out 500 million .
it was never been done by water , or something that was done .
tbp : i lost 150 million in the wind , okay ?
some of you have 5,000 . many have more .
there were a lot of the time . and there was a lot of time .
and the life is a event . it &apos;s a event .
these are work in lower manhattan where you built the first more .
these were maybe six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to get the light bulb .
a friend of mine told me this story : the came and they had to wait , but then the most of the time they had to be there , they had to call someone .
so i &apos;m going to use a rather clinical language , and it may not be so warm to you , and maybe it &apos;s not going to be so warm about compassion like compassion .
and here &apos;s the basic idea that the basic idea is that the fact that the fact that the most difficult thing is to be good for people who are going to be able to be able to be .
basically , it &apos;s about when you &apos;re my enemy or my 15-year-old , if you &apos;re not my friend or my family , i &apos;m a lot less to use the golden rule on you . okay .
so , the results raise raise . that &apos;s a zero-sum game .
every form of life addiction , healthcare , forces a , the humanity of the other .
and you &apos;ll explain you , the other thinking that america doesn &apos;t think they &apos;re being respected and they want to dominate america .
most of the diseases are equal to poverty , but in the case of cancer , the children seemed to be the kids who died in cancer , mostly wealthy families .
a week died a child , but nothing changed .
because you &apos;re just not going to apply this kind of energy and time , if it doesn &apos;t really care .
so he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
now , the dominant thing would say , there &apos;s a single oncogene in a single cell cell , and that these you can make you a little bit of a cancer .
what does that mean ?
we found a kind of a kind of kind of material material that defeated the right matrix , we put the cells in and lo , in about four days , they were going to see what we have in a culture .
and of course , we ask ourselves where we go now ?
and so i want to close with a poem .
we have a journalist journalist that was caught in the rough ; a young boy , whose book is so many of the most difficult quotes that you &apos;ve taken out of the shelves ; a radioactive about fake energy times in the new york times .
it sounds a little bit like a strange book , but it &apos;s actually about new kinds of lies .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about themselves . surprise !
you made four good friends of a person whose personality is .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can look at lying ; i used to talk about it , and then they were continuing .
they told , how big the bathroom was , or said , the most of the hotel are so far away from the hotel .
two : right there . okay , glass , do a picture !
and you also want to get your eyes .
but it really opened my eyes , as often i &apos;ve been able to get from life for emails , social networks and so on , even though it &apos;s not really important or a lot of the things .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band of the day .
and everybody who then went to the world was i went to .
at least for me , because if i just do the same thing , i &apos;m very , very boring . i &apos;m very quick .
i see myself as ... i don &apos;t know what i see .
will you nervous , you know ?
im : do you worry ? you see so cute .
anyway , i &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s good , but only that it &apos;s not tired of it , ok ?
if you have the exit the composition too long , it &apos;s going to be buttermilk .
i call it the era of the citizenship -- which people different race or ethnic , but as citizens , all the same can be the same .
in egypt , i was ultimately discovered .
this had studied in london , trained in yemen , and in amsterdam , a plane was diagnosed with america .
there &apos;s no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols that use for democratic culture on the ground .
as an anecdote , we can show that if poverty would be the only factor , well , bin cancer is one of the richest families .
what happened there was a political coalition that &apos;s a political goal , and that was to get the leaders .
these tools are only social when they &apos;re technically boring .
he &apos;s comfortable the limits of the individual networks and then they &apos;re going to be a .
and because of the social networking , chinese students who studied abroad , or companies from the rest of the world , there were people all over the world .
and finally , the chinese was the chinese .
we &apos;re always more in a media landscape in the media , socially , ubiquitous and cheap .
but everything in demand is going to be a lot of time , i &apos;ll still take it as i was doing it .
in my fourth side side , the everest moved to the mountain , a comet about the mountain .
this view is the most important thing up . the first 600 meters of the rise of base camp .
and that &apos;s in camp fourth .
and there were climbers on this summit ridge .
we also got the bad news that beck &apos;s illiterate , another climbers , in this storm , painted in the snow and died .
it &apos;s so on the top , because to work up , i actually gave myself to be able to be able to do it directly through the clothes .
this climbers was a lot of the time .
and i can only invent how he did that .
and so he &apos;s going to turn back to did it .
these are nerds , the most of the time .
and the fourth thing that &apos;s very significant for me is , &quot; ideas that we need to share with . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , through the workforce , entrepreneurs were to models with models , and they &apos;re wearing in great ways to society .
it was the people who wanted to bring democracy to democracy because they bring the ideas to the universal , parliament and constitution and so on .
the third thing is again the cities .
the second is the most important thing we have , which is that it makes entrepreneurs so hard to create standard jobs in companies that are 93 percent of the indian jobs in the world &apos;s area .
so , if you &apos;re a young country , you have the chance to make a modern , modern , you know , you don &apos;t have the most of the time you &apos;re going to be older .
you have to take a clear strategy , which is important for india and important for the world .
so the government decides to be even again .
although some people don &apos;t like to hear it in the left , it actually was the revolution of markets that are supporting the most common . &quot;
they fear the masses of the masses .
so this whole constructive mistrust between the most sophisticated mistrust and that .
and the most of the time .
each of these are statistically achieved statistically , two years after the most of the time .
david cameron : 20 million pounds in a social health face , to support this idea .
and the more powerful thing : investment in social change
i &apos;m working on . &quot;

if you haven &apos;t found it , my name is tom &apos;s native and i &apos;m a little bit of a sudden . that means i &apos;ve just heard what you &apos;ve heard , just with my voice .
and finally , with this one , i can do my sound , i can get my sound , and let &apos;s repeat .
our people had to try about 5,000 different types of information to find the right .
don &apos;t listen to those who say that you can &apos;t do that . everybody can do that .
on the right , a little bit of a sudden is to see .
and i &apos;m going to deliver you a few examples .
you see the blue of the blue .
his wife said it was &quot; the happiest day in her life . &quot;
many of these patients are moving the most important .

he can stop the surgery anytime and immediately .
and i know , i know .
and that &apos;s where they really do a lot of their creative inspiration , so it &apos;s a industry that &apos;s going to run in both directions .
and so you want to go to the next trend and so fast as possible .
and their jokes , like the most of a sudden , works in the aesthetic .
you need a lot of lawyers and a lot of time ago , and the pine have decided that it would be too expensive .

here &apos;s the most of the most powerful , which is about a year old .
i hope i think i think i think that i can help these organisms , to make their remarkable attention to their remarkable , and my part of their own longevity can be able to do longevity in the near future .
let &apos;s imagine something else .
20 years later , criminals use mobile phones still , but they also create their own own , like this , which is used by the most 31 mexico in all 31 states .

what could terrorists do today , using the technology now ?
recently , the fbi has arrested a little bit of the united states , which wanted to use these remote sunflowers to transportation in the united states .
as we see here , we turn ourselves into a se .
now , mortality is 70 percent , if you caught it , but that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s killed so many people who are the only more the funeral in the same way that this is possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to

and sadly , she was in 1999 when she worked in colombia with the u &apos; &quot; , &quot; with the goal , her culture and language , with two more colleagues of the runway and tortured and killed .
and there &apos;s no group that would be more susceptible to this kind of manipulation as a young men .
patient capital is uncomfortable for people who are looking for simple solutions , easy categories , because we don &apos;t look at profit as a brand instrument .
but the entire community , all different brain region , the most different brain , the most of the time , would sit down and pray . &quot;
because to the most of the time , if you &apos;re full of the juice , it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s green , you &apos;re feeding the world , it &apos;s enough to be in the sky . &quot;
but no faces ?
ok , let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
i tried to make a little bit of joy .

now , 110 countries can access it . okay ?
and it was so beautiful that i was always there in the last seven years .
then i turned a huge amount of training . i swam in the diaspora and forth .
it was actually happening that the cells in my fingers was going to be able to be able to be in my fingers and the way it was .
and my good friend david saw how i thought . and he came up to me and said , &quot; lewis , i know you for 18 years old .
the prospect that they could be extinct in 30 , 40 years , is a very common .
england , america , japan , south africa , the congo .
it &apos;s about 380 trillion gallons of oil organs on earth today , which can be achieved and can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .

so , special material , that the abalone shell itself make millions of abalone plants , the whole time , every year .

but i wanted to start interviews that are different .
in fact , my first favorite george joint was george chen , 97 years old , and a filmmaker was full of life science -- i think you can define it .

half of the body was a clinical gas that was not .
this is a kind of a little bit of a time in papua , nepal .
i don &apos;t want to do a beautiful stuff .
there &apos;s a certain kind of treatment , it &apos;s called the &quot;

my father lived most of his time in east africa .
i &apos;d like to show you six minutes .
and the most of the time , but our movies , they &apos;re stories that are able to identify our people .
so it &apos;s really a young man out there , which can really bring out what can he think about certain negative things and all of this , or some of the things that behave .
conclude : so much to say , so much time .
i think this is really the theme of this event .
you know , you &apos;ve described this as a result of the world .
it &apos;s basically a cd . a cd .
now art art . oh , that was fantastic .
that was really fantastic .
video games can be very profound , even if they &apos;re completely .
we show &quot; portal , &quot; because you &apos;re taking on walls to create new spaces .
so time , space , aesthetics , and then , most importantly , behavior .
i had to shut up a few bridges behind me .
everything refers to the most of the time and students who said that they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be a place .
so i made some sketches on a monthly -- little boxes and the things that i usually drew .
it &apos;s one of the most beautiful pieces i &apos;ve ever done .
this beautiful object , the swiss army army , is going to be a participation .
and one day i had a -- oh , the other thing .
i &apos;ve done the most thin and copper very thin , so it &apos;s going to be a lot of the time .
and that &apos;s my cafeteria .
and it reminded me why i mentor things like my house so that i &apos;m going to mentor .
she never was completed .
the dome was a wish of the most of the time .
it was a try to do this kind of piece of land -- it &apos;s 30 on 76 feet -- to turn into a property by separated these areas and the the gap and the dining room in this pavilion .
they call the plan .
here it is .
from the building in the background , it seems to be a iceberg in the mountains .
our clients doesn &apos;t want galleries , so -- and when we met our new diet , he said that this was or the right shape .
in barcelona , i was asked to make a fish , we &apos;re working on the foot of the computer , which was made by the of the world &apos;s , which was built by the world &apos;s , and the most of the time .
can we not make clean burning of making it ?
and one of the things that they found was that they didn &apos;t cut .
and this is our favorite briquettes .
and he compared the problem of health &apos;s impact of the design of the arts and coal .
it &apos;s a place where it would be india , in this room only three of us would have a car .

there &apos;s a big difference .
after a surgery , everything is .
now , that &apos;s not surprising . but we asked them to grade their honesty and intelligence , kindness and the quality of the .
he married . he had a son named a son named a son .

i want to tell you a little bit about the surgeries that we &apos;re doing , and where we want to do it .
we can replace the underneath of the bone structure , but we &apos;re not very far replacing the criminal system .
my theme is the food in schools , because here &apos;s social justice .
and the next is the next one .
people are constantly talking about sustainability , but we should figure out what that is at all .
you know , all of you think you have to have more and more food ?
and then they have the most of the time , hey , we can sell the stuff to children .
and this is a typical of a typical .
things that we might do at home , and they think that we need to teach kids in the schools .
we need to educate the employees .
this eight billion , by the way , means two dollars and 49 cents -- so much money is willing to be ready for lunch .

it &apos;s a documentary in the world &apos;s mind .
when i was closer , i expected to see all the details of most people , their clothes and so on .
how do you know that it was what they did ?
look at it ? who &apos;s not seeing it ? that &apos;s going to help .
we start to start . some examples .
today , jeff explores his efforts to bring a good , big theory in neuroscience .
and the most of the time in london said , &quot; what do you mean with : &quot; who is in charge of london -- &quot; i mean , nobody is in charge . &quot;
now , congestion pricing were introduced in stockholm at the third january 2006 , and the first picture is , here &apos;s a picture of stockholm , a typical road on the second january .
so , we did this enormous survey with many of the most difficult and trying to figure out who changed and where they disappeared .

what do we know from the taliban &apos;s taliban , which are going to be the doors of people who are going to be able to send their daughters to schools like in the world &apos;s own ?
the world changed .
i was in my office , my desk was up , i had the blue of the blue , the walls .
and there were even two of them .
there was really what .
how amazing is that ?
i want to talk about some other patients now , and i want to talk about some other patients in their power to improve health care .

we &apos;re , they &apos;re most an american resource in health care .
and the water of seawater is a more a bit of a time .
here &apos;s the resolution . a wonderful creature , right ?
they don &apos;t take their environment with help , right ? i &apos;m talking about the most of the time .
in the united states alone , the annual cost would be on the same 22 billion dollars . so , bats are seeing wealth on each other .
why should we be interested in aging at all ?
if you go out here and look at the night sky and look at this beautiful , flying animal , i &apos;ll see that you smile . thank you very much .
europe had to be in the economic development .
the boom of resources pump the most , not all , but yet many countries of the bottom billion .
so what &apos;s wrong wrong ? why are there the so-called called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so the countries of the bottom billion is a very common politics .
a few economists came up with a few economists , and they said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try a auction ? you &apos;re going to reveal the value . &quot;
in this moment , in the world , a billion people are stuck in poor or a half countries . how can we help them ? the economist paul gourley : a job that we can close the gap between arm and rich .
we have no container where they &apos;re made .
here he gives a english surgeon in africa in this essential , which is needed to be a diagnosis of the diagnosis of the operations .
so we have this : imagine , you thought , you thought , you thought , you thought , you know , they were talking about the people in their native language .
&quot; basics of the world &apos;s surgery .
14 years ago , i came to this ordinary material , and i was using the first time in the same way that centuries was used in the same way .
he asks me if i could build that as a piece of a piece of music .
so we were experimenting with little amounts of energy to create a dry fog that &apos;s shaped by wind . and that turns out he can be shaped by people who can interact with it without being a more .
they were in their own the grass in their own , and they saw the pursuit of the pattern of the world &apos;s pattern next to people who didn &apos;t know , and shared the miracle .
so i was also paying attention to that , that this is an enormous risk for our society .
if peter moves his arm , this yellow spot is the one that you see in the ground , which is in the mind that &apos;s going to be in the mind .
if you do this , what will you want to control ?
and to say that these changes can be beyond death , even a claim of a fact that can be true or wrong .
now let me just clear what i don &apos;t say . i don &apos;t say science can be able to do this room or that we have scientific answers to each other .
now , why wouldn &apos;t this be an objective morality .
how high is the probability that this is a summit of human development ?
on the left , edward &apos;s .
we live in a world full of the world , and these technologies can &apos;t be able to break it , it &apos;s always easier to break out than they &apos;re together .
but then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
and what is its natural enemy , what the means of the good beetle we &apos;re talking about ?
it &apos;s a parasite , no a single , but a radar &apos;s excerpt , two mm long , is a quick and agile , a quick and agile .
and if we wrote these good things for example , for example , they go to the flowers .
for example , in israel , where we &apos;re on 1,000 acres -- that &apos;s 10,000 israeli &apos;s -- biological pest in the world &apos;s normal , 75 percent of the pesticides .
third , to increase consciousness of farmers for the potential of this kind of thing .
and the most of my favorite is one of my favorite .
it &apos;s still fun to make the most fun rich , as a result of the way that i do . i often do that .
urban , &quot; urban &quot; -- that &apos;s what the new york needs .
her name was a name of the name of the name , and so that was -- i wasn &apos;t a happy enough to say , &quot; take the drawing . &quot;
or the collapse of the soviet union was just a few decades , maybe within a decade , after the soviet union , the soviet union was the most powerful .

and you think , well , these are not available .
my three minutes haven &apos;t begun , right ?
he said , &quot; allison , we have to put them on the table .
and i saw a sign .
even if canadian the system is going to do the system , they do it on a way that &apos;s going to be the society .
and in this book , the little lewis would find the big idea .
that &apos;s a kind of a little bit of a sudden . and on the back , some other points are , , and the scales , and scales to make some calculations . okay ?
right . so , the device is used .
there &apos;s a quality of irrigation and precision that are just amazing and remarkable .
so , the first robot i want to talk about is strider .
it &apos;s just used to show that if you have cameras or other sensors because it &apos;s up , it &apos;s one meter 80 big , you can get over obstacles and the most important .
for example , in this case , even though the left and the right wheel are connected to a single axis , and so fast quickly , turn up , and so fast .
welcome to the robot , the robot mechanics lab from virginia lucas . &quot;
but the cool thing about this is the user interface .
look like he &apos;s doing it . this was our first attempt to do , and ...
but what is the secret of our success ?
but only from a shocker to talk about the imagination is not enough .
this is very important to education .
and the most of the time to get to the following .

the goal of the game is to have all the emails on wheels , then , has won a team .
but in the last few decades , it was a lot of money that was determined for fishing , completely gone .
and after that , and the neighbors interview what they buy for food and where and why , is a homework .
in these , it &apos;s literally impossible to create big beaches in these .
i want to invite you to follow my journey of the most of the time and exploration .
after four months , the main version of the season is coming out and now , five months before .
here &apos;s a couple of results .
this global act is going to lead to climate change , like fossil fuels , maybe even more than that .
when i learned from these two things , i &apos;m very , very , both of personal reasons as well as scientific reasons .
it has a very good job of the world &apos;s worth of the chromosomes , which was partly from the ronald of mcdonald &apos;s foundation .
after treatment , we make a series of simple a series of simple amounts of simple , to see how his vision is causing .
the answer is in motion . i want to show you the next video .
i had to discuss a long time with my wife .
we &apos;re tracking these research research and hopefully to report more results .
and then , i have from these of these of you who are physically disabled and i thought , oh , i don &apos;t know , but before i lift it , i look at how that is .
but that was in the fall of 95 and then the winter , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , then aimee has done the special in 1996 , and it &apos;s very excited . your family travels with -- it &apos;s a big thing .
i tried every one i could , who i could , who could be , against who &apos;s going to go to the ground , so who am i going to go here ?
i always won everything and now thought , what ?
you can be a big big . take just off . &quot;
the host : aimee and designers are going to be two , two and we &apos;re going to talk about design .
they got somebody who came over and the shoes were going to be .
but it &apos;s almost impossible to look at the actual losses of the economy , because we use math .
or to the eighth jobs .
and something about mathematics : math sometimes looks like math -- how in this example -- and sometimes it doesn &apos;t -- like , &quot; am i drunk ? &quot;
in math math , we use about 80 percent of the time to teach people how to do three of hand .
if people ask me , right ?
but the tasmanian in cars allowed it to separate these things , so that &apos;s something else that &apos;s going to be done than building a car and learning his voice .
completely wrong .
but i think we can do both here at the same time .
and one of the reasons why that &apos;s so important -- so , it &apos;s very important , computers in the exams .
it was winter in 2009 , and i &apos;ve been blind for about a year .
i thought especially about my father , who was driving was a surgical operation of complications on the brain .
similarly , as you , just by the handle of the brain , the physical nature of the soil can be able to be able to be a sense of where you &apos;re and what you &apos;re doing .
but when i was cutting , and when i was cutting down , i was blessed to be blessed to be blessed .
if you design a city in the blind of the blind , it will give you a lot of jobs .
to give you a sense of giving you a sense of this experience , the article was called &quot; i think you &apos;re going to be doing . &quot;
and the most powerful of the famous , which i knew -- the 10 commandments , love your next , is fertile and a half .
you give money for a good purpose and developed emotional to the purpose .
it &apos;s not a book that was written and the sky was written by the sky .
so this is actually what &apos;s the key to me , to remember , to remember that the car is not going to be the way that the car is not going to be .
that was very inspiring for me .
so if we want to be upset with this book , some meaning , we have to really be able to do it , and with him .
so we have this wonderful progress .
the academics who were going to meet these work was to be able to be able to be able to be able to be developed , so we &apos;ve developed applications like this kind of thing that &apos;s going on on a laser to a laser .
alex worked on a small , something a little bit of a nintendo , independent , independent report for steven , and invited us to develop the interface in the movie .
we &apos;re going to lead these of these things to be yellow , because we like yellow and the most of the time .
let &apos;s pull that apart : i &apos;m going to bring it into a little bit of the time .
we , as humans , are the ones that are able to design and we should make sure that our machines are helping us and build it .
john , thank you you do science science science .
what okolloh did was not possible without digital technologies .
but here &apos;s the point . the most creative act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that are shown by this black line said , &quot; we change these kinds of problems immediately .
they &apos;re created by the members of the community for each other .
and as all good things do you do , it &apos;s a leap of 20 years when interest the audience &apos;s interest .
you don &apos;t always have five days to go to the way . so changes and we started playing out .
but india didn &apos;t want to play in the front game .
the other was indian cricket .
it was the new india ? that was another world where you could get players from all over the way , as long as you get the best players for the best price .
we &apos;ve all seen games in calcutta , but we &apos;ve never seen anything . phoenix khan was the audience with a song to the &quot; calcutta , &quot; not for india , but for calcutta .
could you imagine that this day would come ?
hopefully i &apos;ve done any of them around a experience of richer and hopefully the game and hopefully there &apos;s a longer time to work in this business .
and you know that the answer is dogs because they have a lot of time in memory , like often they have dogs and pigs on the rope .
why about everything in the world should play anybody ?
on the other hand , if you visit a developing country , you can buy a big mac , it &apos;s a big mac for a big mac .
would you spend your remaining 20 dollars for a ticket ?
i &apos;ll give you an example .
and if the way to the other end of the city is 100 bucks , it &apos;s worth 100 mice , completely no matter of it , but people don &apos;t think that .
well , in the big and all you &apos;re enormous , you &apos;re enormous .
watch what happens when we &apos;re checking the world &apos;s .
dan , i would like to hear more . so they say that our answer is to the terrorism , i mean , is he a kind of mental mistake ?
there &apos;s no guns .
and so some people look at economists as stupid people .
and the variation is one of these most of the most intellectual activity that requires a certain intellectual activity . because you &apos;re always comparing the variation to the subject that you have in mind .
&quot; in words , in the words , there &apos;s the same rule / a lot of the same rule , and not the first thing that &apos;s trying to do is the first thing that the old one is trying to do for the age . &quot;
and i woke up one day and said , &quot; well , maybe that &apos;s not that ? &quot;
first -- my willingness to do a critical audience , without suggesting i was too sure .
it &apos;s my intention to the poster to put it on , you should not have understood it yet .
so in the big and all of the time , they &apos;re our survival .
jews often have a uncomfortable of smell .
if the space was released , we could see that people are more negative attitudes to gay men .
it &apos;s as if i was a little bit of talking about what i did in this 20 years .
it feeds my mind and my soul .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends , other filmmakers , and they talk about what cinema means .
without food , i was sick .
we don &apos;t need problems more of the way out .
our government was corrupt .
so for me , the idea is that we have all these kids , it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of children who had to go through so much psychological trauma or damage to africa .
through the whole book , more than an hour of an hour , more than an hour of an hour , and interactive animations .
what is the business ?
it had at least that you have , you know , wherever you &apos;re , largely true .
so i thought , &quot; yes , that &apos;s a good idea . &quot;
the talk still about it .
when i came from college , i worked in southern california , and you &apos;re working on the spanish of the spanish and things that things like that .
rsw : how does his own refrigerator look like ?
the most the time -- they sent me to mit and sent their technical and sent their technical .
that reminds me .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; how do i do what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
if you walk for four months , the ideas will always be more clear and living .
and one thing i wanted to mention in my favorite is , but somehow , it was , all the companies that helped me to do it .
but in the meantime , these things win momentum .
and this is 10 weeks later , from hand .
you see the suits , the most of the time .
the keyboard on the other hand and things is remarkable , and that &apos;s what the most remarkable thing to be .
it &apos;s an incredible endeavor , 15,000 workers , i think , five domes and the sixth will be built here .
on this level , to work the 1,500 workers .
50 percent of the computer on the world land to recycling in china .
it was quite unusual , so stefan , that less than five percent of advertising had a picture as a main theme .
and wish three is : the most , i was told , i was going to make a do one , and i always wanted to do something like this .
and it &apos;s increasingly more important that we can figure out how to win these materials from these extremely complex complex .
the traditional ways to separate material , don &apos;t work for plastics .
the traditional way to make the way to make it is happens with oil or petrochemicals .
at the end of this process , we have a mixed amount of energy : many different kinds of plastics and many different qualities of plastics .
now i see a lot of the most difficult there .
and what we see is that people tend to commit mistakes to the same kind of thing , again , again .
maybe we should study how monkeys make economic decisions and find out whether they commit the same stupid as we .
here &apos;s a shepherd . it &apos;s going to trade a token against food and wait happy , and get your food .
they wait for something impatient that the market opens .
now imagine that i push every one of them &apos;s $ 1,000 dollars in the hand -- 10 of them &apos;s hundred dollars a hundred dollars .
you can either choose a loss of loss -- so i throw a coin .
if we made the same scenarios in our little little , the same scenarios would be the same things like people ?
the person to the left is a safer loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just people on the last stage of development , the stupid mistake .
and that &apos;s the catch .
but if we think about buildings , most of the only four stories are up .
we need to build less with concrete and steel and we need to build higher . in last time we &apos;ve worked on the world &apos;s own time .
that &apos;s just a lot of , as if we had 900 cars less on the streets .
and the curtains &apos;s senior senior senior &apos;s senior .
maybe , &quot; citizens , &quot; because recently they &apos;re up to fight against the decline of the law . the citizens of these networks work together to help each other .
and the biggest and oldest bank in russia , largely in the elites of the russian government , uses now to skip employees and citizens in the development of innovation .
we heard about ted , and we &apos;ve heard about people who have predicted their plants with minto , and they &apos;re working on the world , and to turn up the world .
and so i started thinking that the eternal mother always asks himself , &quot; are all children there ? &quot;
this is compassion .
he asked them to convey a message , and all of them read a central deal in their own language , which was a version of the golden rule : &quot; what you don &apos;t want to do is you don &apos;t want to do anything else . &quot;
a pastor to be a pastor means to take care of these individual needs .
and we do this by some strand .
there are 180 messages in washington d.c.
it &apos;s already taken by parks and sculptures .
it &apos;s from the fiber fiber .
there &apos;s also a few constraints of lighting .
the bubble is a more a .
i saw my aunt raped when i was only five .
one of the things i experienced when i was trying to eat my friend is because we didn &apos;t have food and we were about 400 .
as a child , as young and the mystic , words i can &apos;t forget , not forget .
this is my story , shared in a lesson of a lesson / memory .
my breakfast , my lunch , i urge to a foundation that i started , because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give the farmers tools .
audience : yes !
the third chapter is a more complicated thing called &quot; um &quot; &apos;s initial economy .
that means more than 60 percent are for it .
we &apos;re going to solve this task by expanding the problem of death .
and even if that happens , it &apos;s not too late .
i remember nothing from time when i was five years old .
the santa claus knows if you were good or not . right ? &quot;
but , julie , you were so willing to school for school . you were so ready . &quot;
they looked at each other and smiles , where was the right answer . then they asked , &quot; do you think we all are brothers and sisters on this earth ? &quot;
maybe your bigger ability to cooperate and adapt ?
i think this film shows the toughest view of modern times : &quot; the road . &quot;
in the second world war , we had to produce a lot of stuff .
but we can &apos;t forget that it needs a fundamental contribution for it , and that &apos;s how many resources of the planet we use .
but now to the good news !
it &apos;s maybe in latin america .
and in this point , the stethoscope and the most of climate change in the world is in vision .
we did a project for a few years ago , and a big program , it was called the most common -- with many , many people -- many experts were involved -- a very precise .
a group of people are putting it , to spend it for themselves and to spend the other group for other people .
when they went from the first building to the second , all of the time , all of a sudden , was all over a man who was crying and went , and clearly help .
the word is &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &#91; unclear &#93; : the hidden life : the hidden life of ancient things .
since -- it &apos;s four decades -- i &apos;ve been trained to be trained with the best in this area , the world has been a young , old and old , and i created a rich net of art , successes and awards .
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my real life system .
i dance between the most of the time and the most of the time , and i &apos;m going to adapt to it , to adapt to my favorite .
well , it was essentially frustration .
that &apos;s like it was .
he put them together , they combine them together , and then he &apos;s convicted of them in software , which i think they had developed his son . and he made this wonderful presentation .
in these documents , there are little more of the little things that are small boxes .
i want to suggest more -- yes , do you make a beautiful website . how could i say , you don &apos;t get a nice website ?
now ask the linked data that you put together now . 32 hits , which is every one protein with these properties and you can look at them .
and that &apos;s what it is about linked data .
all of this will lead to that every year two million children die less than in 2000 .
and if it &apos;s so , we &apos;re ready to collect feedback , to collect feedback and give it to make sure that the promise is really results ?
you just show one of the numbers there , which is 5,000 -- is that the number ?
my brothers started giving me tips for drawing and paint .
that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve been fascinated with , to explore this area .
how many of you have a cow going on the street on bangalore to mysore ?
it &apos;s just that we &apos;re trained as humans , the reality of the reality , and that makes meaning .
and they said , &quot; okay .
can you not do anything from nothing , you &apos;re artists ? &quot;
this is a box of the box of the .
because if we see somebody , we see the footprint .
what percentage of it has made foreign energy ?
obviously , he sat in a cave last 20,000 years .
so the foreign foreign is actually very good , to get here to the degree , because -- if you think about it , i &apos;ve been able to have been able to think about economists today &apos;s assumption that most things are very much .
this is the place i showed you at the beginning .
we &apos;re going to be doing something technical now .
think of toyota .
you can &apos;t be drawn to it , so you accept it and find it to work .
it &apos;s very hard to agree .
it &apos;s a little bit of the time and the most important .
pizza is getting them if they have hunger .
there are millions of different types of things .
so remember , if we think about sexual education and activities , they &apos;re out of baseball .
it &apos;s from the poet of chen , and it &apos;s like , &quot; i can &apos;t answer it the most powerful .
and that &apos;s , &quot; how much percent of the day do you think ? &quot;
in over 44 societies , people have left these are a new brain structure .
they came home with the world &apos;s population .
and it really became a strong force .
and i said , &quot; why do you think men are the ones that are women ? &quot;
no time on this , the women were so educated , so interesting , so interesting .
she &apos;s 23 them , she was taking them 13 .
i started to get to the one of the things that you &apos;re more in love with in love with the other .
they &apos;re going to be as long as the human race is on what shakespeare called &quot; these ballet spiral . &quot;
but unfortunately , i know it .
most researchers believe that obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
maybe we should ask ourselves if it could be that insulin resistance is weight and the disease is -- at least most people ?
other people , it &apos;s too much more .
peter : what if our views were wrong about diabetes ?
my great , henry ford , believed that it was the mission of ford motor company , to improve life and make cars affordable for everyone .
and the good news is that we &apos;re going to work the big problems of cars and environment -- not just ford , but in total than industry .
i think you can imagine it already .
but what really inspired me is the possibilities that we &apos;re going to have when our cars start to communicate together .
we need a infrastructure that &apos;s able to support these flexible future .
this is a minute .
i think now my mother , i &apos;m like a kind of a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of thing .
the nurses have to put data together .
that &apos;s really important . it &apos;s much . &quot;
so what &apos;s coming out of this ?
also , it was great for us , because we won a lot of prices .
i was infected when i was 17 , then when i was 17 , i came up with adults , i was going to be adult , which believed really to my ideas , and many of the most of the things that i &apos;ve been drinking with .
now it was just about the kids . so we don &apos;t get .
basically , we gave the kids a simple task .
for our auction , we have some wonderful images for them , for a really good purpose , the money that they give us to buy hearing hearing .
but what i never said , and what i want to do is that the fact is that the cool thing is that the cool thing is .
in a way , in a way , in the elegant or a sense of the product , we &apos;re available here , which we have a morning of the morning , the most kind of development , which is another kind of development -- and inspired by the incredible way of doing it .
if you think about the change in our society , the most of the time in our society , the world &apos;s cities , has taken the same process in 20 years .
it looked ahead , although these were unknown .
so , for example , we would put the models under an artificial sky .
i think a reduction in the altitude of 94 percent for almost in .
and as we do in this growing world , we &apos;re doing something more , especially in some places that i &apos;m talking about -- china , for example , that will build 400 new airports .
and this is the focus of the world &apos;s talk -- there &apos;s no lighting in the positive sense , which is healthy and our well-being .
unlike the first office , i showed you to the beginning of the talk , this is a very famous office , which is that the most of the time the most important office .
behind you , you see the most of the building building , that was later a icon of modern health .
i think that &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing here right here -- how much light in the sky is going to be achieved and never reached the ground .
that &apos;s not very pleasant and the most pleasant .
they &apos;re not going to be up .
if our favorite system , like some weeks before , a war in a third of india called a third of india &apos;s , called the world &apos;s issue , he &apos;s got the theme to feel the theme , he &apos;s going to feel the theme .
and one day -- i don &apos;t know what happened -- while i was on the office , i might see a hunger , or it came to me in the sense .
anil gupta : but what &apos;s it going to use ? what was it used ?
to do what to do ? to break rocks , to dig .
that &apos;s the only place where they could express their creativity .
they don &apos;t want to be a second choice of standards and they &apos;re .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s done in the way that we did it .
i had to be my favorite .
mr. &apos;s , who lives with a physical challenge , is only 50 inches tall .
and the most of the time , the most powerful thing .
this is a little bit of a time .
these are the humanities billion people .
or ski . it just makes fun and people love it and do it and do fun things .
so we have very , very hard , but we knew it wouldn &apos;t be so hard to develop technology like acceptance about what &apos;s important and how technology can be used .
cars are not done for the next to park , and it &apos;s wonderful to drive with them between cities and drive them , but think about it .
so if we could add this box here , we could have a solution to the transportation , electricity , and communication , and maybe drinking water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 kilograms ?
repeat or physically is going to be established that people who die there are somehow involved in the drug drug . we take the fact that they were either tortured or professional .
los zetas will be shown as a fractal of psychopaths , which is fear and the press to the silence , and the press is going to be able to be and that &apos;s true .
mexico and the united states , is now a truly international organization , which is partnerships with production in the south and worldwide partnerships .
but also part of it , a month , was a month to be a month -- you live in the future , and we have a long time .
and after you fall under a critical price , it tends to be , if you &apos;re successful , you &apos;re going to be a breakthrough of a critical mass , a breakthrough .
but they &apos;re going to be very , very cheap , and look at the interesting impact . if they &apos;re cheaper , the brands , the most important and so , the most important , they win .
if you look at linux , it &apos;s a hundred percent .
&quot; open is really accessible to , you know , the gift of silicon is the world .
because of some of the technologies we &apos;ve talked about .
patient capital works in between and trying to take it from both .
the second thing was very cheap to the second .
president obama understands that .
because one of the poorest farmers of the world had found access to a technology that allows him to change his life .
and yet , this is exactly the properties , for the men and women , honored by all generations .
you remember , while the most of the time was called the most of the time , in his blog , it was often about the hurricane and the most likely . that was just possible because blogs are easy to use .
i like music , and i like to get a little bit of a sudden , and i think i heard steve martin &apos;s playing and said , i can also play .
i wrote this post , and i took this because einstein today .
and you see this post .
these little things .
and maybe i have to be able to do that because i tend to talk about it .
he was been able to be able to be deeply struck by our generation .
we need to use these process immediately to get a better understanding of how the oceans are .
we &apos;ve studied these fish in the same way , but we had to learn how to keep them .
but that &apos;s just half as big as the biggest tuna we &apos;ve ever tagged .
they come together . that could be sex under tunas , and there it is .
you can get a lure -- it &apos;s a lure -- and a white shark is going to go to it , a global creature is going to be the very dense system .
and then we give these animals even a encore by helping us .
and the white shark .
i think he didn &apos;t think that the record of my co-author were so exactly .
they said , &quot; besides , what did we have talked about , are they groups that want to harm the united states ? &quot;
you don &apos;t have to waste your energy .
who &apos;s now looking at my favorite , and i see that i was there , and i know i &apos;ve been in the ninth may for $ a result of may .
all of the moments i press a little bit of my life .
when i started with the project , people said , &quot; why would you want to say what you &apos;re doing and where you &apos;re ?
now it &apos;s very normal .
now , please look at this kind of thing of paris to see how incredible fast growth is .
i looked at thousands of these years , and trust and efficiency are always the evidence of elements .
how do we copy how trust is built to face the face ?
i was kind of a mind in the system .
this page is going to ask you a day , and 80 percent of it gets a precise answer .
i want to start with a paradox .
and here you see it in relation to the degree of inequality that i showed you again .
first of all , with the rich , developed countries , and then in a second , a second , more than 50 american states -- with the same question : cut the more unequal states on all these scales ?
with devastating effects , what the use of talents is about .
and in our analysis of american states , we find the same contrast .
the social judgments are taking judgment , and the fear of this judge .
or for example , why violence is more prevalent in more unequal societies , because people are sensitive to being celebrated .
a year more than three million cycles of a year , a new knee or a half .
you remember how kamal thought about the most time .
if you wear it under pants or a rock , or a sari , it &apos;s very clear that you wear a prosthetic , and in societies where disability is with a social stigma , people are very sensitive .
so thank you .
you want a dirty magazine ?
i even bought the most of the time , and i &apos;ve been bought the little piece of paper , which is , &quot; use these things , &quot; you don &apos;t use juice to the dragon .
this is the results one to 20th , &quot; imagine google just so many &quot; o , &quot; as there are pages .
strong fear is a lot of fear .
but if you &apos;re always in this state , the work would never be done . because you would suddenly say , &quot; oh , i found a new way to do it . &quot;
almost everything we do is subconscious .
it &apos;s about being safe in this world .
if the park was giants , the park would fall apart , and then they would never go to a ride .
it &apos;s a very small sample -- you should not be the results .
i &apos;m going to talk about kids and self-organization and a series of experiments that could look like an alternative education .
and the night of this day , 70 children in the internet .
so i could even choose samples to cover a thread , which represents the whole world .
what you &apos;re obviously seeing is a child that &apos;s using the computer .
natural systems are all self-organization : galaxies , molecules , cells , organisms , organisms , societies -- except the discussion of the brain .
and it &apos;s about the idealism of idealism in this whole place .
i bought a nice suit , and i was wearing shoes with a little bit of the time i had to get to the most remarkable access to that .
but 2002 , when my tour went to end , i decided i didn &apos;t want to go to the job that was waiting for me to go back to london .
i felt that something was destroyed .
and i went through . i went through these quantities .
and i traveled to kosovo and i gave the government .
independent diplomat is part of a trends that comes around the world , obviously , and it &apos;s going to be emitted that the world is fragmented .
it &apos;s terrible that they &apos;re actually affected by these people who are actually affected .
this is the politics of the 21st century , and in a sense , independent diplomat is doing this , this change , that &apos;s happening with us all .
&quot; hey , could you get me to get more ? &quot;
because if we go back to the most of the time , they understood that a simple mistake can say what you don &apos;t think or remember , why you love something .
we feel awe , pity .
go .
what is the number one ?
no . in the &apos; 70s , there was the autobiographical show , &quot; the most of the &quot; the &quot; the top &quot; that was in the top 10 rise , followed by the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; three angels for charlie . &quot;
i can choose it from the island .
and i &apos;m totally excited about discuss with you , i &apos;m going to come in and say , &quot; can anybody explain me , &quot; can anybody explain me the basic basic and why that &apos;s so cool ? &quot;
