clay shirky , this great , great design of all the mesh , has the premise that &apos;s going to be asked to be on the top of the world , so that &apos;s wonderful .
now , there are so many new foundations that are the most important and investment , and the people together , together , together , in a major context , in a larger context .

we &apos;re worried that texting , texting , facebook , facebook , is damage to the most powerful , but the research of the research is how the most profound ones can promote relationships to communicate love about barriers like remoteness and more and more .
one of the things we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed several vehicles -- is how we believe the first autonomous computer system of the world .

and before you don &apos;t have kids , you won &apos;t understand what i mean . &quot;
these deaf people are discovering in adulthood , in the community .
it always takes time .
true guilt is just a single person &apos;s head of a person , and someone with syndrome is not a person . &quot;
to the people who are not far more than that .
but i found that i &apos;ve been born the kids i &apos;ve born , so love that i don &apos;t want to imagine a life without you .
he wouldn &apos;t get his legs right .
i come from a privileged family . i &apos;ve had a lot of luck .
it &apos;s about two weeks old . and there you are .
this is the beginning 2000 . my son , dimitri -- that &apos;s also here today , many of you know dimitri -- went to cambodia and has built school , just as she was connected to the internet .
think about it -- because there &apos;s other people like bill gates who said , &quot; man , you have a real computer . &quot;
latin is also quite rare . let &apos;s look at some languages .
and guess what ? we won it .
we have a case for that , not to integrate any extra carbon capacity to keep prices down .
for a more precious , my apartment is about as alien as space .
and we can take care of the issues of the world &apos;s issues .
and to talk about a cliff cliff , i was told to be a little bit of a time , although i don &apos;t know what party is supporting or attack .
wealth is going to be people that you shouldn &apos;t call the &quot; a &quot; as a function of life . &quot;
in the subject , there are bigger benefits here .
no one of these most important theories was a full success .
we have fear that the world is watching .
and as a lot of these work , we found something , or i found something that really fascinated me , maybe you can remember it .
in fact , it &apos;s happening here -- from light to darkness in six seconds .
i see your faces very precisely .
that &apos;s not a expression of joy .
this lady here actually has a particularly special face , and both sides of it are beautiful .
this thing here , it &apos;s a light of light , if you move , so it gets a little bit of a sudden , and it &apos;s a little bit of a time , but it &apos;s just just like brilliant that &apos;s done by the reflection .
i had to move this part , but only to a millimeter .
and that one , which i showed you before , was a very complex .
it &apos;s going to win or lose in this moment .
the emotional band between this object and you can shape it is a very , a more powerful thing that happens before you &apos;re thinking about it .
i don &apos;t think we have to make this choice .
it &apos;s also a thought that we forgot .
i think it takes to return to the tradition of the sermon .
we don &apos;t think so .
and at the end of the day , they &apos;re all on and say , &quot; thank you , plato , thank you , shakespeare , thank you , jane austen . &quot;
the other thing is that art shouldn &apos;t explain that artists should not tell their motives , because if they told them , they destroyed the magic and we might find it too simple .
art would be one of the tools that we can improve our society .
we may not agree with the conclusion of what religions want to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way that they do .
absolutely . i meet how many of you , people say , &quot; is there not something that &apos;s bigger than we all , something else , something else ? &quot;
because you agree to 90 percent because you have a similar view of the way that you have a lot of things , and you &apos;re polite to other people .
so he led me from places like chile -- the northern desert in chile -- in the underground mines , in underground mines , in north america , in north america , north america , to antarctica and even south pole .
it &apos;s the largest lake in the world . it &apos;s 800 miles long .
and they &apos;re not going to believe it , but that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be called the extraordinary big telescope .
this hut was built by robert gardner &apos;s scott and his men when they came to antarctica , on their first expedition to the south pole .
remember , these whole wiring are people in extreme cold , in the coastal temperatures .
this is an interesting statement , i &apos;ll end up with it .
what people are doing first is book book , which is that you can look for the book , and that &apos;s fun .
it was quite a lot of people .
but how do we scan them all ?
we &apos;ve reached the 10 cents a page when we work with big volume .
i &apos;m not sure what borrow exactly what &apos;s going on .
a day , about two or three wooden transplants .
with 15 dollars an hour , and about 100 to 150 dollars per hour , we can put material online , and we can put it in the net .
the question is : is that the world that we want to live in ?
flowers are going to get rid of the nest .
we all know that the earth has problems .
after that , they go from spores , they rot .
if you go through the landscape , it &apos;s going to be high in your shoes and tries to react to the rubble .
across the dirt all the dirt .
some of these mushrooms are very happy .
this is a remarkably rare amount of water .
i did something that nobody else had done .
the box of life -- you get a dvd from the ted conference -- you give earth to the earth and water , and you have both of the most sophisticated and more cosmopolitan , like the spores of agarikon mushrooms .
i &apos;ve lived in biosphere 2 .
we wanted to know : is life adaptive enough ?
i kind of ate myself in some way .
and the doctor studied us to make sure whether it really went well .
and everybody went to me .
and the other thing that &apos;s been done is , in the old days , a part of ethiopia , one of these places that are amazing and incredibly , and i have no idea how people do it , and i don &apos;t know how people can do
this is this beautiful picture , this is the amazon .
this is actually a very reactive .
i had to think about how to take tennis and cut , but also how to choose the right person to come into a car factory .
you put the kind of break , you took blood off , you put blood , you look at the microscope , put it under the microscope , put the culture on it .

we looked at the wooden towers for skyscrapers , we looked at the most sophisticated , and we found that they have technology and education , and then they have something : they have checklists .
and it &apos;s just hard to spread .
so these are really a lot of bees , and that &apos;s very important .
so that means that beekeepers can replace their dead peoples very well , and they could keep the losses low .
they take their hives and their families , and they &apos;re going to be twice twice in the year .
honeybees are in the minority .
take a cave in new york with a million bats , now , now , there are 1,000 bats , and that &apos;s as if san francisco is in three years of the population of half the population .
now , not all of us have turned out , or lawns , which we can turn to , and so you can always turn a meadow in a $ walkable place .
and i whistled at the holy night at the family of my wife .
and to defend my title -- like the most athlete and other athletes do that -- i thought i &apos;d go back in 2005 , and won again .
this is very promising .
why ?
the blue whale , the largest living living on our planet , is wrong , completely wrong .
and during the night , they roll their leaves and reduce the movement , and during the day , the leaves will open -- then there &apos;s a lot more movement .
he wrote some very interesting letters on one of his friends , and he was a friend of the royal society , the president of the royal society , which he talked about from a computer company .
so , the human being only inspired by people or the animals when he made a robot .
she doesn &apos;t know she &apos;s going to be filmed .
and then when it became a common experience , it was funny and something that she could laugh about .
i was inspired by it .
this is in 2005 .
she got two of my boys who had hidden cameras in the hidden cameras .
it &apos;s a wonderful way to spend a more powerful way to look at a stadium in a stadium .
the idea is in the beginning , but it &apos;s just like this .
this is ted .
and this is the cover i want to break .
now , kids don &apos;t have the other thing to do , they &apos;re a special case .
they &apos;re kind of a kind of a laser form .
the discovery of natural selection is great , incredibly brilliant .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done on this kind of thing .
the ant is not alone .
you &apos;ve just heard this man .
i really appreciate that .
well , i don &apos;t think that .
well maybe we should take it metaphorically .
it &apos;s the devil of speech . &quot;
so they &apos;re actually a chord , each of them is a personal chord .
men , if you don &apos;t understand anything from this talk , it &apos;s trying to listen to the ted and you can change your relationships .
the third problem with the headphones is the deafness -- the sophistication of the brain .
so , the way is a wonderful way .

we thought this guy was a materials .
it &apos;s actually seven billion of the world &apos;s own passion , which all of your own passion , and all of them are coming together and create this world -- in their own , and in their kitchens .
and yet , you can hear black holes , even if you &apos;re invisible , the reason is that you &apos;re playing on space-time like a drum .
but our sun is not going to end as black hole .
now we &apos;ve never seen a shadow of a black hole , but black holes can hear , even though they &apos;re invisible .
we can predict how that will sound .
it &apos;s also supposed to be a mission for space , which hopefully will be starting within the next 10 years . it &apos;s called lisa .
it &apos;s closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago , we &apos;ve made a little bit more sophisticated .
trees represent a gridlock .
i think that &apos;s a movement .
we &apos;re critical to the west , the view of the west , which is our identity -- the image , which is drawn from us , about our women , about our politics , about our religion .
but instead , i found a country that was completely ideological and i didn &apos;t have more of the time .
that iran once was a secular society , and we had a democracy , and that we had this democracy of the american government and the british government .
i &apos;m standing here to say that the iranian women have found a new voice , and their voice is my voice .
on this self , a size , a wholeness , focus , focus .
there &apos;s no american compassion .
maybe the swami is right .
they learn swimming through swimming . they &apos;re learning wheel through wheel .
the fossil condition is just found in this area in south america -- a beautiful clear field here -- and in this part of africa .
you just see these videos . if you &apos;re bored , you just go on .
but i was thrilled , and i kept doing it .
the khan academy videos are also there .
this is the shift and reflect from functions .
red means they &apos;re going to be a lot of the time .
a lot of the efforts to make human human focus focused on the &quot; students &quot; to teachers .
and the collaboration that they had with los altos , how did they come from ?
is it ready for the big toss ?
a few months ago , i got a call from a computer company where i work .
but it &apos;s still silent , like a silent silent . &quot;
she said , &quot; who is this charles bonnet ? &quot;
for example , when his favorite card went to visit him , he said , &quot; and who are these young boys ? &quot;
and then , if you were standing , the young boy flew up , and 30 meters high , and disappeared .
these properties of a dialogue is not in these kinds of neurons .
there &apos;s a domain in the anterior part of this fusiform , in the teeth and eyes , and this part of the fusiform is active when people have the most sophisticated hallucinations .
&quot; kermit , &quot; i don &apos;t mean . &quot;
sometimes i find them interesting . and i have a lot of images in my inbox .
edith widder : i &apos;ve made these pictures with a special camera whose sensitivity of the darkness is being worthy of the darkness .
for example , this crab is mapping bioluminescent materials in the water , just like a squid or a squid .
this is what a plant looks like , but it &apos;s actually a animal .
there &apos;s something little that react to that .
it should attack the predator of the mountain .
one approach would be to draw a picture .
if we put the double double in your two strands , you see that these things look like teeth .
it &apos;s packaged and it &apos;s a lot of time .
one is to be a more threatening .
again , these are all the things that are more powerful , scientific design .
hold your eyes open and your head in motion .
the ability to have concepts intuitively with images of objects and processes .
if the most thin place is very thin , you can be able to be with care and hard work to the world .
i &apos;m here to commit to you , to help us to change the way people and other creatures are making things .
not through the most sophisticated , but it &apos;s allowed by collective action , which is created from literacy .
the other big narrative of social dilemmas is the tragedy of the commons .
toyota , instead of his suppliers , treated the way that they &apos;re doing a network and trains them to produce better , even though they train them to produce better for their competitors .
thank you .
thank you .
we &apos;re doing two different things here .
in fact , all about frostbite and difficulties are running and the way they walk -- cold , challenging conditions .
first of all , we &apos;ve developed a little experiment where we gave people legos and they asked them to build something .
and if you said , we gave them a new one , and while they have this kind of thing , we have the other thing that they &apos;ve just built , again , apart .
there was a very nice relationship between love and the number of legos .
and i think the ceo of basically not understood how important is .
but i should point out , by the way , that in the shredder condition , people could cheat .
people didn &apos;t want them .
and we had two types of people .
now think of kids .
and i think in the industrial revolution adam smith was right than karl marx , but we &apos;re really in the knowledge of knowledge , and now we &apos;re in the knowledge of knowledge .
this is in modern conflicts , because children are very easy to send in the war .
the vietnamese of my mother was so bad that she was doing to make our story , all the young and girls , and girls , new vietnamese names .
afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the population are illiterate .
they didn &apos;t want to do that . it &apos;s just happening . they lost control .
and 70 percent won their lives back .
i think that &apos;s all given me energy .
this is the european average for the european average .
on the top right , the same energy consumption has the same energy consumption per person , in about 300 light bulbs per person , but the population density is 300 times larger , 1,000 people per square kilometer .
if you really want to get out of solar cells , you &apos;d have to take the traditional carbon lanes , which you don &apos;t just have to do the roof , but the landscape with solar cells .
and a third possibility is nuclear .
i tried it . it works . some call it change .
as a boy , since earliest , i &apos;ve always wanted to be a musician and thank god , i &apos;ve become it .

i &apos;m going to show you some of the latest and more of the cybercriminals of cybercriminals .
if you want your rivalries to go , you will be able to go .
how do you get a key key to a company ?
so let &apos;s imagine that our attacker we call the fun of evil hackers , something more powerful .
there are some other interesting contributions that have uploaded the cybercriminals .
well , you probably ask yourself what happened to these people .
in the middle of you , i could identify hotels in which they were recently , with the very precise precision of somewhere on the globe .
thank you .
the adults can recognize the juveniles who can recognize the juveniles .
and they &apos;re in something that probably the blood vessels are through the bones .
we all know that these bones are scattered and when you appear to get them in acid , they should actually stay there .
the most powerful ones are the big , manipulative , who are extinct .
and it &apos;s also really cool .
a friend , a colleague , dr. hans larsson at the amur university , also engaged with the food pad .
people always say , &quot; why do you do that ?
and finally , i started writing my book to show the global scale of this problem . this shows a graph of the individual nations to the one of the world &apos;s food .

there was only two more more sophisticated things in the internet .
i &apos;ll go to talk later .
i mean , all of the time to put it on &quot; the &quot; s &quot; that would be like a call of your favorite , but for the whole world .
it could definitely be made of people here from the audience .
for example , if we had a chance to have 350 years ago , we had spoken about the current innovations of the military , about the massive industrial technology , and we could have been able to predict a era of stability in the world or in europe
now , in this environment where you don &apos;t know whether the potential enemy is prepared to attack or attack , and whether the weapons are going to attack the attack , this environment is what &apos;s going on most of the time .
it &apos;s a huge blue area .

so what does this play for the brain ?
this has taken a long time -- i had to have homer , and i had to get through the mri and the mri and the most powerful , but as a result , he &apos;s got a computer company .
their own personal play is unique and often nothing we think about .
he &apos;s characterized by a sense of a sense of the experience of the world &apos;s , complete , success and success .
how do you prevent the media to interpret your work or interpreted the science , what your work is now about , about how the most important , about the way the most important , is that play is the intelligence .

but what it was immediately melted out was the variability that our economic development had dominated -- that if the oil prices were high , our economy grew very quickly .
the same thing we do in the field of business .
and otherwise i would have wished that you see this .
he called them , &quot; massive fatal , &quot; which means that they could kill up to 100 million people in the next 50 years .
until recently , we didn &apos;t need to know how a vaccine was exactly working .
the main challenge for these two viruses is that they &apos;re constantly changing .
these drugs are not cure , but they &apos;re a huge triumph of science , because they &apos;re the automated death sentence of a single at least for those who have access to them .
but you know , the research that has happened to hiv has helped us with the progress of other diseases .
this was a slow process , which was dependent on chicken eggs , and millions of living chicken eggs .
and more naturally , the radical production of production and the vast amount of the e. coli for example , for example , i &apos;ve just talked about -- look at the energy of time -- that &apos;s the energy that &apos;s going to be life .
so the challenge is full force .
the question is , why ?
do you think african union is going to organize such a conference ?
there are some things you need to know .
the speaker who was here on the stage was , i was going to see muhammad , pointed out that we had the leaders in africa .
by suffering it from your suffering .
traditionally , africans hate governments -- they hate tyranny .
they decide what they do .
he doesn &apos;t get help from the government , and he &apos;s building a second bigger boat .
something that would connect us all together .
scott &apos;s results were full of it .
and the challenge for algorithmic filters , these personalized filters , is that they &apos;re going to balance that balance , because they &apos;re going to go to the very first time , which is what you click on first .
it &apos;s supposed to be a new ideas of new ideas and to new people and strangers .
and the man said , &quot; well , pretty much , what ? &quot;
i know that you &apos;re waiting for more bad , i &apos;m just making fun -- but now , just a quick repetition of repetition , and then i &apos;ll show you a little bit of stuff about possible solutions .
to the most important of may , it will be a update on 2.0 , which you can then get directly to buy from the purchase of the world .
even again , all the republicans here : it should not go to the ground .
what really impressed me about the gulf of the gulf is that they &apos;re more restrained .
and there &apos;s no one that &apos;s trying to do any more , except a few people trying to use the beach .
we heard that bacteria eat oil ?
this is the ocean shot across the ocean .
when the japanese pearl harbor was taken , they were at least back .
what the gender of birds are doing is i don &apos;t want to make a little bit of remarks about people who clean birds .
okay , people who are conservative when they really wanted to be conservative and really really , they should be sending these corporations to the most profitable .
it &apos;s about right and wrong .
and i &apos;ve developed a system to produce medical boards .
all right , &quot; i &apos;m more than my genes -- &quot; all together .
i didn &apos;t ask you to get it to the ground because it &apos;s true , but to remember it .
they contain a molecule that we know as a brain epidemic .
and that &apos;s just a kind of a computer . it &apos;s a lot smaller than a human being .
now , neurons , as trees , can grow new branches , and they &apos;re losing old branches .
and we can even talk about the most sophisticated .
if you celebrate these numbers , you can easily give you a big idea that there &apos;s a big potential for the brain .
maybe this technology will be able to know that we know ourselves by moving down and put our own brain together .
he &apos;s mostly working on music videos and ads with his company , the most prolific .
so we &apos;ve prepared a quick experiment here to show you this .
ks : no , not .
and he did that , he noticed a unexpected thing .
ks : so , how does it work : there &apos;s a matrix of the internet revolution .
ridiculous , right ?
and a few months ago , a friend sent me a link to this guy , eduardo sousa .
a huge scandal for a few weeks .
but he still did .
so his farm is incredible .
and then he found these wild plants , the most prolific plant .
and then they fly in the circle .
i finally came to try and try and try and do it before i went .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
what &apos;s the hell that &apos;s called ?
at least , i think it &apos;s like .
farmers who rely on nature to find solutions , instead of nature , rather than nature &apos;s solutions .
and to change the old fire , it means to change two big stories about oil and electricity that are both two fifth of the fossil sea in the air .
our fuel for mobility is three fifth cars .
you can let it go quiet , it &apos;s tougher than titan .
trucks and planes can use realistic hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
even better light and more and so forth , the maximum water rate to get a third .
already in about 20 years , private oil consumption has been cheap solar cells without financial losses on their roofs and lower their own food .
and what we &apos;re also replacing is it &apos;s going to be about the same cost : about six trillion dollars in net net -- although we buy more of what we have or new nuclear and called renewables , or renewable , which are more or less centralized
so , on outcomes , and not incentives , to focus , can be able to focus on the energy system and conflict to the world &apos;s energy solution .
later , i realized that what i had eaten , two of his family , was true of his family .
this simple thing shows that donor donors in areas , where the least kids go to school , don &apos;t have schools funded . this is a new question , aid , aid that you need most ?
two years ago , at april eight , i called my father .
i &apos;m not trying to design the toothbrush .
we remember and can look at this in every book of my favorite son , that life was formed four billion years ago -- four billion point of point two ?
so , i &apos;m not quite sure .
there are risks , there are a trap . the vertical .
you have time to think of time , and you have time to talk about art and things like that .
you go back to the future , back , back , back , so .
they come from families , which usually is one person at home , mostly the mother or grandmother , and they come to their education and their structure here .
we &apos;re bringing them to the right and to turn on the left , so they can tell them to follow and know the consequences when they &apos;re ignoring orders .
let &apos;s go all online . &quot;
it &apos;s defining .
they said , &quot; that &apos;s enough for the design .
you can support us . that &apos;s the task of you guys . &quot;
but i have to have my hotdog .
you can listen and join .
let &apos;s take the design of the water .
if you think about wikipedia , you &apos;re thinking about the content of wikipedia , and at the end , you &apos;ve created the largest encyclopedia of the world .
there are many people who have the same dream .
a website was made .
there was no leader .
extremism has become tolerance .
the modern tools of neuroscience show us that what happens there is an incredibly complex process .
we can hold the sounds apart of our own language , but not the stranger .
we went to see that by the way we were born american babies who had never heard a second language , at the beginning of the critical phase .
it may look like a solar system from mars .
science on one side has a very rational approach to their environment , while art usually has an emotional approach to its environment .
now i have a live place over here to show you this .
let me demonstrate this over here .
the dalai lama once said , &quot; love and compassion are a lot of the time .
the canvas were the causal of a little girl whose body was burned .
it &apos;s part of every human being .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we choose to be with compassion ?
the wound over the maggots .
suppose squares , and honestly , who doesn &apos;t like them ?
we start with a computer system and then we put another more kind of carbon .
then there was a silver designer , a computer company .
i am , &quot; he &apos;s been dead .
&quot; did i have what was going on ! &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t get a boca . what happens ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what do you do here ? &quot;
so i went to the lobby and saw this indian guy .
marco tempest : if you asked him to deception , he said , &quot; magic is the only thing that &apos;s the only job .
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to demonstrate to you how closely terrorism is connected to our daily lives .
at the time i interviewed the red brigades , i also discovered that their life wasn &apos;t by ideology and politics , but from economic constraints .
i think many people thought i was even a little bit of a little bit of a time .
but especially they went to serious crime with organized crime .
this money was got in a hospital and the street , and in the bar , it understands .
nobody wants to control the story of the world &apos;s story and set his own to clients .
some of you may think , &quot; wait a minute . you don &apos;t necessarily see a little bit like a baby &apos;s .
clearly , i wanted to leave my favorite , but what i didn &apos;t have seen was that it &apos;s an original extreme , and it &apos;s very uncomfortable to leave his favorite .
and i really learned that , the bigger the challenge , the bigger the feeling of a special performance , if you get to the end .
well , i thought the atlantic was big , but the pacific is really big .
but that wasn &apos;t without a safety system .
it &apos;s this little green disk on the horizon , which makes you very nervous because of the rising sea level .
we can start to make better , more sustainable , more sustainable decisions .
brené savage : why i &apos;m going to go through the pacific
this is the world trade trade on the cover .
why ? why ? why do you want to do that ?
he doesn &apos;t see any organs . he doesn &apos;t use any extra time .
they were able to make that .
and finally , it &apos;s about comfort , it &apos;s about comfort , you know , you feel good at places that you didn &apos;t feel good about .
and that &apos;s hard when you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i asked myself , how can it be so easy to give up my dreams ?
it &apos;s not so hard to do somebody , and one day before school , i said , &quot; yeah , you can put my homework , &quot; and i gave him the wrong answers that i had written in the night before .
we were both put in the back of the class in the class , so we wouldn &apos;t be able to do with the very first of the world .
maybe you brought your credit and you &apos;ve brought your teeth , and you never told you , because how can you say you , if all of you want to be buried around you ?
this is french science .
well , then go .
if you look at this truck , it &apos;s the largest truck of his way on earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the largest and the fastest growing of co2 in canada , and it &apos;s also the reason why canada is now the number three in terms of the number three .
and as a father , i can &apos;t imagine what the soul is doing .
by doing that , we remove a big part of our biggest health and replacing them with the most greenhouse oil oil of the future .
the most important of her work is the courage to buy in every store and the millions of indian women every day on their forehead . it &apos;s a ritual that &apos;s very closely related to the institution of marriage .
and the shaw shaw was born in the wild , in the blink of the u.k. , trained in the jungle .
i hope you can convince them that complex and complicated are not always the same .
the most important thing is that the one we want to affect -- the public support for government .
so i proposed in my first tedtalk that we should spend 21 billion hours a week with video games .
only 30 minutes a day of a day for a significant improvement of the mood and the nurturing of joy .
why a game ?
how could a game so much a game in the serious , and sometimes , you know , have a huge effect in the serious , sometimes , you know , in the very serious , you know ?
there are four ways of strength , or resilience that causes to promote post-traumatic growth , and there are scientifically , scientifically , scientifically , things that you can do every day to build this resilience , you don &apos;t need trauma .
it &apos;s more practice .
here &apos;s another secret for you : if you shake someone &apos;s hand for six seconds , the average of your blood is going to increase a lot of the blood , which is &quot; the &quot; the &quot; s . &quot;
and in this project , we actually have hundreds of people around the world , and we &apos;re doing it with us . actually , thousands of people are involved in this project , many of his different aspects .
and then a few people came from chicago and said , &quot; end of 2007 is the slogan of chicago festival , the global warming , and we have a 3,000-square-foot square gallery , and we want to put them with their reef . &quot;
wool and the other things are not just two concepts that fit good .
and the first one asked , &quot; how can i define parallel lines ? &quot;
infinitely . she did it . it was very much .
so we have , from wool , running domestic capital , the proof that the most famous thing is the most famous of mathematics .
and their individual ideas , and their employment with this mathematical method .
this particular recursive property -- the self &apos;s self -- is my opinion of the holy grail of neuroscience , neuroscience , and eventually we &apos;ll hopefully understand what &apos;s going on .
this person is otherwise at least understood and intelligent , but if he sees his mother , his delusion and he says it &apos;s not his mother .
so if this area is damaged , you lose the ability to see faces .
tables and chairs and chairs -- nothing happens , just like normal people , but if i show him a picture of his mother , the most low activity is low .
he knows that his arm is not there . nonetheless , it &apos;s a compelling , more powerful experience .
maybe you can do the most powerful thing that you can solve the phantom .
and my pain is gone . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , the last three days i didn &apos;t have a phantom and therefore no more , no longer a little bit of a nose , no spasm , no more , no , no , no , no , no , no .
the blue is blue , f is green , another sound could be yellow .
that &apos;s the key .
which is kiki , which is buba ?
your favorite is to be a little bit of the way that most of us don &apos;t deal with .
that &apos;s kanzi .
none of the things you &apos;re going to see in this video are the most powerful .
good job .
he learned that he &apos;s using both hands , with his specific family , much larger and more powerful , and more powerful .
a frame means a hut in the forest .
he looks where the sound comes from ?
because we believe it &apos;s not the biology , but the culture .
and some stars die in spectacular explosions that leave the remains .
on the right , gravity is the gravity . einstein has explained this .
and it &apos;s going to bring them out new ways of change .
it was too early , but he was a moral guide , an inspiration for scientists who were concerned about the control of the guns .
suppose we &apos;ve seen aliens living in our own place from far outside the cosmos , not only 40 years , but the entire four billion years of the earth &apos;s age .
martin rees asks this , is this our last century ?
and it &apos;s even worse : &quot; then i would make a picture of it and make a dozen of a dozen .
now , these are students , so they gave a lot of money for things like earrings and makeup .
and then we asked them again , how happy they are .
but enormous different incentives .
these are the most powerful in belgium .
the teams that we gave money to spend it for each other , were actually to other teams and struggle at the end of the league .
if we hear about the most popular , from the high school , we often believe that this is another one of these most profound conflicts of the middle east , which is the roots of the middle east .
ironically , that was a time when the most iran &apos;s climate was used to peace with washington , and not the destruction of israel .
this is an analogy that is acting to be able to stop diplomacy , and diplomacy is inevitable , is inevitable .
you can look at certain types of neurons or you can look at the different regions and compare them .
the map of port is not as good as you could have been , not as good as the map of california .
the trick is .
and she said , &quot; he was not a environmentalists . &quot;
this system wants to keep the status quo , also the status quo of a government .
so it &apos;s not about my theme that &apos;s the most important thing . it &apos;s not .
we can &apos;t do anything . &quot;
lawrence lessig : we , the citizens , have to return the republic back
for example , some people in this room will be sputnik with a scholarship to school .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m on on my pen . &quot;
everybody &apos;s just a little bit wrong .
i don &apos;t want to say that the law of entropy is not true , it &apos;s true .
here in the model , you see the attack of the computer .
if you see in north america , the way that many things are active in the united states is active . they ignore each other .
each of your favorite points depends on this critical region , which is the most important , which has about 10,000 independent cells , which each of the humiliation has , has a electronic rhythm -- a high tension , a low -- to send a signal to pump
they were a while in sync , but then they were apart .
so i want to first show you a few interviews with people who were opening up on the bridge and describe what happened .
now , you don &apos;t normally think of a metronome , but we &apos;re all running -- we &apos;re going to go back and forth .
im : so , this weighs just a few tons , so it &apos;s right .
it &apos;s the most popular scientist in his area .
i didn &apos;t say what the list was , but she was in the order of a game , and i told you , you should look for your name , your favorite , or the women &apos;s names of her mother .
also , perhaps this fowler or maybe a more powerful , which is not worth economic , a resilience against disease or pests or another property that is useful for climate change , and the other ones don &apos;t have .
we &apos;re going to see kids in tv .
the idea with svalbard was that there &apos;s cold , so you have natural temperatures under freezing .
and if anything happens , you can come and pick it up .
thank you .
look at your body position ! this is not right .
maybe any lady , a lady ? thank you very much .
you &apos;ve only tried two concepts -- two in the united states , and one in the russians .
madness ! i have to talk about innovation innovation -- the things that are developing , there &apos;s a lot of activity , and then they &apos;re replaced by something else and die .
i can &apos;t tell you when it goes , because i don &apos;t want the competition to know my schedule .
i mean something really interesting that &apos;s going to happen here .
ok , let &apos;s talk a little bit about the commercial development of the global space space .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a few years , he &apos;s ready to give up , but one day he has a epiphany .
institutions are going to be naked , and if you &apos;re naked , well , the consequences .
the fourth meaning of openness and fourth principle is a lot of the time .
the bass is from the u.s.
you know that bees and fish live in school .
all around us , a medical revolution , is a revolution that will help us defeat some of the worst diseases of our society , cancer with including .
this is a tumor , dark , gray , a weaker mass , a more livable mass , in a brain .
and you can see that the ring of blood &apos;s blood is disappearing .
but the real question is : how good does this work work in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add a nuclear record . it prevents angiogenesis in very effective ways .
but more interesting , from the study , that the men who have developed the most powerful , so the ones that have more tomato sauce have had less blood vessels , which have fed their cancer .
albert von the other time said , &quot; discoveries is to see what all of you have seen , and think of what nobody thought . &quot;
i &apos;m a witness at discover magazine .
it has to be fun , unlike everyday problems , which are not quite designed to be a very good thing to do .
one is the background of the other .
you can &apos;t do that physically , but you can &apos;t do it on a computer .
i wanted to make a sequel .
what direction will you fall here ?
so there &apos;s games like &quot; brain humor &quot; for the nintendo , a computer company .
looks like a black character . where is this ?
i really believe that a girl is so powerful , so powerful that we had to train all of them , not to be .
i remember , for example , my father , who was very , very violent , i proposed .
we &apos;re so used to steal girls of the difference , to be the human life that we actually made them objects and they &apos;ve been transformed in .
and she looked at the eyes of her babies and said , &quot; of course i love my baby . how could i love my baby ?
when we were there , she did a ritual where she was girls who were gifted , with her families .
and i &apos;m going to be on your side of your life . &quot;
i love that i don &apos;t take the things easy .
why should you turn me to the point of , you know ?
so , in the actual process , all six teenagers were saying , and the most powerful , the most successful they had made by the photo array .
but the incident was in the middle of january , on the northern hemisphere , to seven o &apos;clock at night .
this is 10 feet away .
and what does this example show -- what &apos;s important to us in memory ?
he was a very religious man .
i got a year and i went through africa , and i was asked by africa , why i asked people why they were building fractals , which is a great job when you can get it .
and that &apos;s what it does in some villages to the smallest level .
it &apos;s not really mathematical knowledge .
he said , &quot; if i lived in the jungle , i would just use a long time , because it &apos;s very fast and it &apos;s very cheap .
and just odd , odd .
we have a nuclear war in ghana .
but the bad news is .
instead of turning on friends or family , they looked at david &apos;s workplace .
today , agile development is applied to a hundred countries , and it &apos;s enough to go up to the oil industry .
fear of being lost . beds do .
we &apos;re going to make a couple of rules and hold them on them .
the conversation is going to run better . &quot;
now , when i was going to go back tonight to come here , one of my daughters started to come up with me .
and we developed 10 .
i was a teenager when i first read &quot; anna &apos;s &quot; anna , &quot; and the famous first sentence : &quot; all happy families , same one .
i want to show you how to look at something invisible .
if i came to the water here , you see a silver ball , and this is the most powerful thing that keeps the water from the water of the ocean . it &apos;s dry .
and plato with all the young boys in his cave . sweeney : ...
i &apos;m going to show you .
but tesla was not successful .
one thing i want to be very clear is that not all the neurosurgeon are wearing the tail .
we can turn them down or turn it down , or turn it down .
he &apos;s one of five children .
i showed you that we can apply it to the circuits of the mood of depression .
we &apos;re to understand what these circuits are and what the areas of the clinical signs are responsible for the clinical signs and symptoms of those diseases .
evolution is actually working in a rather more like a failure as a engineer .
that &apos;s enough !
what we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human being like richard , or a cockroach or a crab or a kangaroo , the relative to the relative of these feather is equal to all that we &apos;ve seen now .
okay . the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , right ? it &apos;s incredible , students have tried it and they couldn &apos;t say it .
he does this with a solar glue .
what we do is we take the hair as a role model , and imagine that they &apos;re with another colleagues from berkeley .
and that was that from the married leading leading men , two thirds of the married men have children , but only one third of the married women .
at monday , i left san francisco , my favorite , and flew to this conference .
and we go out at the end , and we look at , and say , &quot; how did it go ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous study at harvard business school about a woman named heidi meegeren .
and i &apos;ve got my hand back and i fell in all the other women , and then you &apos;ve got more questions , just by men . &quot;
a woman contacted me and i looked at it -- she saw something young .
thank you .
they don &apos;t do it as usual as they should , but they do .
so not fear was the defining factor .
but it &apos;s the middle of the black .
now , i want to talk about this in the next time , thinking about how we spread health care in this country , how we get information .
so you &apos;re in clean , clear language , and that works .
we tell them that everything is fine ; it &apos;s good to tell you .
this patient is about 50 , we can actually say pretty much how big its risk is to get cancer .
they don &apos;t need the level of the audience in this room .
and this bee certainly had thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to get this kind of thing , this flower , i &apos;ll get the nectar and then i get off . &quot;
and if you talk about nature , the author of my favorite topic is how is the idea of the design ?
well , we &apos;re all equally sophisticated .
the only technology here is the cheap carbon , which is pretty new , a car car , even i could close a little bit of a little bit of 10 ar in 15 minutes .
if a nuclear reactor , the grass is going to be on this cut , and it &apos;s going to happen immediately .
and now i say that i want to build a layer of games on the top of the world , but that &apos;s not quite true , because it &apos;s already in development ; it &apos;s happening .
if not , it &apos;s a bad thing . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
come on to a certain time , you get your drinks for half .
and then you can really achieve a good way of doing good .
and it &apos;s powerful .
so , the most important thing is a community dynamic that tries to find the best news that &apos;s exciting stories .
we &apos;ve talked to you last time a few years ago .
you also see , if i turn this around -- hopefully i don &apos;t have the world too much .
you can see here , there &apos;s started .
this is one of our engineers .
so , laura , who would have been teaching students to teach the law of the secret , just as a hobby , as a hobby .
raise your hands .
it makes it a place where it makes fun to work .
and so that &apos;s what we &apos;re working on , and we even have people who are excited about it and crazy enough that they &apos;re working on it , that &apos;s really their goal .
thank you .
what brunel , as he said , was to get to his passengers , the experience was to glide through the landscape .
what does life make easier , more pleasant ?
and part of it , they &apos;re doing this by building a great new facility , using the basement of one of their hospitals .
today , the industrial systems of time have been more restrained and in fact , in fact , part of the present problem has become .
and as brunel can , we can do it by doing a bigger effect , a bigger effect .
from my persistence , the waiter was surprised by his boss .
mark ornish and i &apos;ve tried to answer a series of studies , right now .
yet , it &apos;s exactly what the american paradigm demands .
but for the european , the ambulance availability of all these things were on the market as a nuclear war .
the americans themselves discover that unlimited choice in theory seem more attractive than in practice .
and the parents would say , &quot; noah was just for the short time , &quot; but he was so taught to us so much .
robert frost once said this , &quot; it &apos;s poetry that &apos;s lost in translation . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant , very elegant . &quot;
the three problems have one in common : they &apos;re problems that are controlled by forces .
so thank you very much .
it &apos;s supposed to replace competition through collaboration .
and then we build a solar system that we can test the peak of the machines , and so we can get very , very quickly .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that the most important thing is not going to be understood as a design of the best , but as a result of movement .
the bomb enters the stage .
and then the 92 nuclear power , which would provide the energy , the rest of los angeles .
then you take it and put it on the screen of your television , and you &apos;re going to get it out of the inside , right .
if you replace the word blogosphere or the internet today , it &apos;s very right that his perception is now very , very controversial . let &apos;s hear it .
i think it was this exchange that led to physical computers .
ph : i hope you can understand how to do that .
ultimately , the race has won the future of momentum than the phone phone company .
mm : because it has given the audience to do something .
they produce things for 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute .
and where television has been built , what &apos;s built , is a very exciting new way of communication , and we have the collaboration of two industries and a new way of thinking about it .
this is a spanish architect and designers .
color can be revealed simple blocks , simple materials : if i go through new york , i think i &apos;m going .
it gave me suggestions -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco , and we all talk to us and build some installations .
the use of the city for public space is significantly , almost a international model .
even the parts of the airplane had french words .
he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s more girls there . &quot;
and that was , after all , i was looking for some of the most cosmopolitan and the design of the chair that i &apos;m going to show you .
he said , you have one of the new , better chairs .
or they &apos;re going to be up to the position .
i knew , but i knew , in the offices , and when i looked around the offices , where there was no one on the idea that anyone would come to the idea , and to turn the head to a train , and to fit it into
and silk fever has spread in a lot of plastic .
two days ago , or yesterday , i can &apos;t remember exactly , i read in a computer factory , that the first one has been going to be tested , about 52 lost cases , about 52 times cases , with about 400 times more likely .
we need something that was really , really , really , really , really spread the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : males are female , lots of offspring .
so , the biggest problem is not our biggest problem .
&quot; why now ? &quot; &quot; why here ? &quot;
and most of the time i &apos;m barely dropping out of it , although i &apos;m a computer maker .
look at the data available .
now , our mobile phones can now build a story of our own .
bill ornish : your health depends on where you live .
this is my grandfather .
and that &apos;s the reason that nobody else talks about it .
as the dawn of the ground , plants are going to pull phosphorus through water .
here &apos;s a remarkable article from a very remarkable article from a natural nature of nature , which is the discussion of the phosphorus crisis .
eighty percent of it is going to be like mentioned .
and instead of a dose of 100 percent , we take one of 25 percent .
we have a working technology and one that &apos;s going to be a few of the most prolific use of some of the most cosmopolitan that we &apos;re doing on the world &apos;s surface .
and he was a fan of the name : he looked at all the most violent and mutations to find rules and laws , instead of looking at the norms .
and in this example , you see that the individual steps are repeat , but they &apos;re repeat without being a more inclusive .
as an architect , i just think of relationships between the parts and the whole , but in terms of working on the creation of the system , it &apos;s always a matter of business .
we were going to be on the level of the building of the building where we could build the five separate towers , but they should all be on the 60 floor to a single mass of the mass .
and again , let &apos;s go back , a few years later , in 2003 , and we &apos;ll see that this landscape is actually actually looking at the first time after rainforest .
the difference is mostly in the desert in the desert , or maybe the most important in the desert , whatever you want .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that have been illegal and now on the air .
we &apos;ve doubled the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world just by fertilizers that cause huge problems to water quality , in rivers , lakes and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the most important thing for the most important .
but we can do that and there are opportunities .
irrigation is the biggest largest trade on the ground .
work together .
so -- what is the system that &apos;s actually called solar d.
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
the whole system of system is not paying .
we interact with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biological degradation to amplify these kinds of neurons -- muscles .
so this is what it looks like .
here we are , or cut the nerve , from small parts of the world &apos;s brain and left other pristine that gave us our primary -- signal . two other people who gave us our hand -- signal .
ak : it works good .
but i can &apos;t put an electrode in and say , &quot; there . &quot;
and that &apos;s our goal -- something clinically more clinically to carry .
this is jesse and he &apos;s a fan of a computer .
so thank you very much .
sub-saharan africa is largely , because there are 22 million people living with hiv , which are more likely 70 percent of the 30 million people around the world .
governments in the place have to create effective health issues for ethical aspects in clinical trials that are approved in the different developing countries , and they &apos;re being established by the government and the most responsible of the study .
the fundamental problems that we &apos;re faced with are a too high consumption and too many people .
so they all meet the criteria that people usually like .
so you see this power that goes north -- the most powerful in this case -- the way to the galapagos , and this is the kind of light that goes up to the galapagos , the most powerful , the most common , the way up to the
we also know that not only are the most profitable , but the other things that are happening is the same oiled and other people .
now i want to show you that penguins are moved in in the street .
turbo has arrived with his claw to pat the door , and we &apos;ll let him go in and it comes in .
and then there &apos;s another one that comes out very comfortable .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we haven &apos;t solved : our fundamental political geography .
the two parts of a very long frontier .
again , as in the case of mongolia , china was not conquered russia . it &apos;s a lot of the time .
for the other countries , china reduces its average , so that the most powerful and cambodia can sell their cheaper , and they &apos;re dependent on the more cheap and dependent on china .
what i want to do here is i call a day , day for day .
these two arrows form a bow , a bow of the street , and other infrastructure that connects the west bank with the gaza stripe .
a lot of them .
so what &apos;s next ? how does the future of european union look ?
53 countries and far the suspects , most of the suspects , are on the map .
this dream is his time time .
it &apos;s bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like this .
okay .
and the hormone turk is expanding growth .
so how can a hormone end the speed of aging ?
we think that insulin and igf-1 are hormones that are active in particular circumstances -- in good times -- if food is safe , and not much stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details about how it works , but we know that foxo genes have an impact on the lifespan of people .
and basically , you could change the genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process i &apos;ve talked about , which is very quickly going on in the worm , has a different normal , like a bird , so that the bird can live much longer .
you will never see such a display , because nike wants you to buy your shoes .
they all show heroes that were the most powerful .
it &apos;s like trying to walk against a more sustainable .
this view is that many of the most powerful things that are going to change as prozac in the essence of the brain is if the brain is actually the brain of a chemical soup .
and my colleague colleague seymour seymour believes that .
and by the time , we found that a mutant , much longer needed to get back to the top of the world , and when we were putting the genes , the genes were played in this mutation , we could discover a design system .
and this question has been asked for a long time for a long time , but we can actually test it in the fly .
so , mosquitoes find us in the dark by making us feel like it &apos;s going to smell .
just to see it , that &apos;s the cheese .
people even said that they &apos;d like to be bitten by mosquitos now .
in the blink of the war .
and every time i was paying the weaker look at the eyes of the eyes behind me .
and as a result , fat is one of the best sources for adults .
while we &apos;re talking about , about a little bit of a clinical clinical trial , we &apos;re going to use the use of stem cells for the use of stem cells .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angels in the world , not just in our country : venezuela . in our entire world .
so what happens when it &apos;s not happening ?
but here you see what &apos;s really going on .
i can &apos;t tell you about it , because i stopped the headline .
brené allende : what you don &apos;t know about marriage
but how ?
it &apos;s even better . it seems that we can make these receivers , with the help of the material that is encoded in dna .
the animal jumps , it &apos;s spreading its wings , it &apos;s vibrating , but it can &apos;t really go , because the fly is caught between two glass .
for a intelligent creature like our fly , this rule is not in stone , but it &apos;s changing as the animal learns through experience .
through many such experiments , we were able to pinpoint the identity of the critic until 12 cells .
there &apos;s a few ideas in the field of the world and the artificial intelligence , as you could do , but we still haven &apos;t solved one example of how intelligent behavior is about physical interaction in the physical matter .
here &apos;s stalin , or actually a kind of a laser of stalin .
ed : yeah . tb : okay . a little bit after the inside , a little bit more to the middle .
i know from the experience of the experience that hospitals can be a very dangerous place for young people .
here &apos;s a picture of my favorite legacy from legacy .
one of the things i &apos;m telling you is that this kind of care system that includes everything , from your goals to your genes , will be the most powerful transformation that we &apos;re going to see in our lifetime of health .
they don &apos;t stick like a velcro nor a velcro or glue .
here we have the robot .
marc libeskind built the most powerful thing .
what would happen if you climb on the bottom of the piece of paper and you would get a little bit of a paper , or we would shake the sheet ? &quot;
and so , you know , it &apos;s done . and he does this .
of course , it &apos;s completely different than you would see that in a corporate scanner .
we &apos;re going to look at the rising sea level .
and i would say , the people in the ocean work and think about the goals , we should be a lot lower .
this is the ship that i was in antarctica for the last three months .
if this ice melts up the sea level , the sea level goes down six meters .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news for coral islands are the the galapagos .
you have the water water .
but then at the end , you see the most sophisticated in black .
we have very interesting opportunities to the co2 in the atmosphere of millions of years , and we &apos;ve just done this with a little bit of the time , but in this case , we &apos;re going to go back 20 million years .
and this is the task that einstein asked : figure out how gravity works .
einstein already had room and time , biases and curves to describe gravity .
but deep in the structure of space , the idea could be more dimensions than we see there .
and as the strings of a cello can vibrate differently , the ones can actually vibrate in different patterns .
not yet .
is this just an interesting mathematical construction that may be able to explain some of the things that are in the world , or can we actually demonstrate these extra dimensions ?
so we have two plates here with colored dots .
now , can the predator see the predator , which is what it is , they attack ?
and what sensory information is true is generally true for all the information .
and we look at about 30 seconds of what a pretty hammer is in a 18 minutes long .
why ? because if the dark in this shadow actually would be in the shadow and reflect the same amount of light on your eye , like the dark outside of the shadow , you &apos;d have to reflect more -- just after laws of physics .
how do you know that ?
and she comes into the hive , finds a blank , and your hands -- and that &apos;s honey .
he finds him . madness , right ?
vote ? yes ?
there &apos;s no right right here or wrong .
in 2010 , in new york , not so much .
we &apos;re also a species of storytellers .
now some things : understanding security , the risks , the dangers , the way you work .
but in a modern and complex world , they need models to understand the many risks that we &apos;re faced with .
think of cancer , avian flu , swine flu , sars .
there was no new insight , but less fear .
and there &apos;s another cognitive bias : i call it a little bit of the way to accept data that we &apos;re going to confirm and reject data to our own data .
i trust another group , if my airplane was safe to fly with it .
this is the people .
and he was found in the near near , stanford .
they had good shots with their teachers , students .
let me ask you some questions about whether that &apos;s a good choice . &quot;
i took a person to get it to you , or save them , or saving me as a volunteer , but i found that nobody did anything .
we opened the first section of 2009 .
robert blakley : building a park in the sky
and groups were very often called terrorists .
they need a more powerful process that can deal with the core of this very complicated society with its problems .
it &apos;s about that we probably have the first time in the history of arab world , a revolution , a revolution , a more recent .
the paradox is that the last decade was so promising , and it was from a main reason .
once , the ngos were calling their slogans no longer on the streets -- they took them into the negotiations , because they were taking the victims of these guns .
thank you very much for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think that &quot; the &quot; s &quot; is something good .
so this was completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little crazy to work on a new computer system .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this strange rich man in the movie ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the last day , the sun comes out , the nazis come , they come right to the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i &apos;m going to give you a little nervous here , because i &apos;m going to tell you a few radical things about how we should think differently about cancer , a lot of people who have a lot more knowledge than i do .
the part of the genome we can read is the list of ingredients .
it &apos;s a huge amount of information in genetics by simply comparing genetic addiction .
and i , &quot; okay . at least this guy is good . &quot;
so we &apos;re basically measuring every single type of dna as a own .
if you have malaria , we give them a little bit of time , or some of the things that are .
where we really have to get to the process , the process that &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s the level of the brain &apos;s activity on the level of why the body doesn &apos;t heal itself , how does it usually make it ? &apos; &apos; &apos;
danny hillis : cancer &apos;s understanding of proteomics
they all are members of tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to give up these people .
because at stage three , most of us are .
this is their lobby .
there was no plan . never before , anybody tried something like this .
in fact , martin luther kings was in stage three .
so i &apos;m sitting here in this chair , and i don &apos;t do anything . &quot;
and suddenly they got out of the street , and they tried to figure out , &quot; how do we ask the population of sub-saharan africa ? &quot;
automatically , we &apos;re going to get the little bits of plastic up .
and this one , or the most cosmopolitan , that were designed to make a lot of energy , to make the taxes for the ground , to the ground they &apos;re not considered as a permanent building .
they &apos;re going to be the stability and security that can offer the lap of a uncle , comparing them with the bollywood construction of a brick niece in high heels .
but from my perspective , compassion has a problem .
and it &apos;s the most powerful form of the brain &apos;s delight .
i can &apos;t really explain it , and it doesn &apos;t .
stories like this , sign like this , are practical aid in a world that &apos;s going to be a reminder of compassion , to bring the overlap of suffering , which could otherwise deny us .
gandhi was also a really , really , really popular person .
and the first day , our main team was going to be our head and taught us our motto that we had to do every day for the rest of the summer to make the distributed movement .
this is one of two or three of your known known .
here are some examples .
it turns out we can &apos;t be part of a group without imitating the other thing .
so that &apos;s the world we live in today .
and so i &apos;m trying to learn from my grandfather &apos;s own way to learn .
okay , number two : go into the wild .
and imagine that , you know , you &apos;re going to be born a inner picture : i was born in a very small village in mexico , unfortunately , very , very , very , very powerful circumstances , and my parents had no higher education .
and so we believe that through all the changes that are happening , we &apos;re going to be able to meet incredible opportunities today .
it &apos;s an initiative that is on simple , to get , and it &apos;s a very simple way to get on .
we &apos;ve now sent 30 different technologists in 18 different countries , and we were able to connect millions of people to try to learn what this particular segment needs and demands .
and my father came to me and said , &quot; you know , i remember you , i remember that every generation has to make it better than the previous one .
i know many people who are very smart and yet say , &quot; why can &apos;t i solve my problem ? &quot;
i started with them in 1980 with another family .
don &apos;t you think we have the responsibility to take the environment seriously ? &quot;
i still drive the same four years old , as well as it was .
but that &apos;s not a good life .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s praying .
whether you believe or not , it doesn &apos;t make any difference for me now .
so he said , &quot; what do you think in your hand ? &quot;
what &apos;s that in your hand ? &quot; i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball , and this basketball represents her identity , which you are .
when my kids were still small , i went to her room , sat down on her bed and looked at my kids in sleep .
it &apos;s less than i had -- i was doing three to 10 million -- but yet it &apos;s a very significant number .
in a village , we have 100 laptops , every one with a different collection of 100 books , so that the village suddenly has 10,000 books .
right , the famous chinese character for the computer &apos;s book .
they answer the question : how does it feel that you can imagine that you &apos;re wrong ?
we really learn this really bad lesson .
think about how it &apos;s a moment to feel like it &apos;s right .
and unlike all other animals , we &apos;re obsessed with trying to figure out .
and i have to tell you that i thought i was writing this incredibly nerdy book about a subject that all hate to hate a audience that would never be .
the effect of this is not just the wheat of wheat , but mountains of grains .
1986 , she came from vietnam to america .
the answer was , &quot; that &apos;s even worse . &quot;
our main team sank on a third of the average in our industry , and in the five years of the dotcom , our primary school system has tripled our food system .
and bhutan , for the ones that don &apos;t know , is the youngest democracy of the world , only two years old .
it &apos;s actually that we &apos;re often going to hunt the west , as if happiness is something we have to capture , a thing that we need to get , or maybe several things that we need to get .
and we ask 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s the simplicity .
what we need to learn as leaders is that we can affect the production of production by creating the right conditions so that our employees can live their calling .
bl : okay . one , two , three .
and under deck tells you the inner ear , you move you . but the eyes are moving in the way that you &apos;re going to be able to say , &quot; i &apos;m silent . &quot;
amy , you come up to the top ?
the method : what did you do ? the result : what have you seen ?
i just read one .
real scientific education should give people a voice and give them to express these things , so amy should have the last word in this short story .
poor people have no choice of choice .
we went back to the &apos; 70s .
and to come along there , we have to realize that the principle of a brain that is not only hurt the species we &apos;ve talked about , but our society is also being pushed .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure somebody &apos;s already asked , &quot; yes , great stuff up there -- but how do i get up there ?
i was a professor at the university of davis , and i got a lot of attention to this , and that allowed me to fund the launch of the program .
we have eight motors in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart , they fall down and they end up here .
i mean , people ask themselves if cell phones are safe .
you have a coil .
because , remember the original idea of dr. strangelove : the most salient mobile phone of his wife .
and for those who can &apos;t read it , it says , &quot; it seems like it &apos;s actually a kind of wireless technology . &quot;
green or natural , natural , which is not going to be a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the existing toxins in our bodies .
first , a computer , folded with a plastic , which is called the &quot; death death death . &quot;
i was only months later , who he was really .
i &apos;m looking for a cure .
i say , &quot; hold it alive if you can . &quot;
even with this , in our hands , we have the hope of the hope that we &apos;ve always been redefining .
it &apos;s a feature .
suddenly he knows that he was defeated .
to give you this , we have to put them back on the driver &apos;s seat .
we &apos;re going to put it in the area , we put it in , we sent people into it , we put the buildings in the inside , the building industry , we helped the first time , where we were looking at the first time , and
if i do this , i don &apos;t lose the original details . in the opposite , i could write history here .
you &apos;re being accused of the public opinion .
that &apos;s not very good .
and what &apos;s a democracy is .
here &apos;s the question : what country cut better , china or india ?
because the indian man has a advantage of life expectancy in the world of two years .
what political change is , they &apos;ve introduced them to be introduced .
china , i think , has always been some very amazing , more fundamental principles -- especially in terms of social capital , public health , a sense of equality that doesn &apos;t exist in india .
it was a place where people with the different people with the different kinds of things and with various kinds of plastic and they were .
and now they have the problem that they &apos;ve spent the whole money to do help with this progressive electronics in these countries and now it &apos;s all useful .
a slightly chaotic environment , where many ideas were made , where people were more , interesting , interesting , interesting , more interesting , human conversations -- people different .
about a decade ago , a wonderful computer project was a wonderful , wonderful thing called howard &apos;s notebook , and read darwin &apos;s notebook from this period .
they &apos;re going to be in their colleagues , but everybody said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think it was to do it .
does it go the other way ?
in the 1970s , the one percent of the national income was in the united states .
many of these political factors can be rough in the category of crony capitalism , political twists , which help a group of good interconnected , but actually nothing good for the rest of us .
as you can see , as globalization and technological revolution , this global rule of money is creating the money of money , it &apos;s much harder to evaluate the whole .
so they invest unprecedented amounts of time and tools to train their children .
we created the modern health system .
this is his little hand .
one of them is going to be all of us die .
this was a huge disappointment for us , because we believed in a new development .
i even believe that in places like oregon , where you &apos;re taking care of medical care , and a toxic dose can eat it , only half a percent of people have ever done it .
so , long talk short , you came to canada .
but i heard about cancer as the most popular disease of our time , how did the good and the bad ones together ?
some articles even went so far to say that skeletal muscle is resistant to cancer , and beyond , not only against cancer , but it &apos;s about the fact that metastases spread in skeletal muscle .
16 percent ! that there were these tumors that have been in skeletal muscle , but only 16 percent of the actual metastases -- which is the fact that skeletal muscle is capable of controlling the tumors that are able to control the tumors that are going to be
this is a very far idea , but i really think that &apos;s possible .
and then my translator left me .
she was the girl who was in the breaks of the other team for her team .
and i was writing a letter on my best friends in atlanta , georgia , who had a 11 year-old son .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot; i asked the translator .
so the two came to lunch , and we were thrown out of the restaurant .
he had children from all of korea , and he found families for them .
they have a lot of time on the dictionary .
so i open this window , look out , and see how flames from the page of the hotels are shooting into the height . the hotel burns .
so we ran into the bathroom , took towels and they kept our faces and the children .
until the adoption is . a year ! what &apos;s going on there ?
this is their favorite .
this is sydney , which is three years old .
but there was no evidence .
there are little planets , there are bigger planets , there are big planets , okay .
but there &apos;s a lot more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something that depends on the planet ?
and this deeper , more visible , underlying the point is that science is the way we know it , to define the life .
okay , let &apos;s say this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , okay , from here .
thank you very much .
look at the , while uganda falls down and zimbabwe , russia goes down to a percent .
they find the highest hiv in the world in african countries , and yet they find in senegal , down here , the same rate as in the united states .
look at kenya here .
it could be something else , which is the transmission of the transmission .
we know that about 80,000 billion people have ever lived .
that wasn &apos;t just a economic story .
and the result is even a greater divergence in a shorter period than it was in germany .
it &apos;s the same thing with institutions .
they have to give me just food . &quot;
he was wrong .
now , i want to end with three questions to the future billion , briefly before 2016 , when the united states is losing their place as number one economy .
no , we &apos;re going to be able to stick , regardless of the huge , big , the big , we &apos;ve got to be , regardless of the signs that we &apos;ve lost our work , and other parts of our historical world .
niall , thank you .
there are many types of spider silk .
spider silk is almost completely entirely protein .
the fibers that can make a single spider is quite diverse .
also , a high potential for the ability to do it is to be a high potential .
what i want to do is not to be the mermaid , so lovely you may be , but on the photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there are more pictures . there are more photographers .
that sounds alien in our ears , but what happens is that 80 percent of the contributors have contributed much .
the first thing that happens when you &apos;re a problem is that the first goal of the institution is immediately changing by what &apos;s going on to the target .
the inventor doesn &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states who are trying to figure out whether bloggers are journalists or not .
it was made by making their own , the use of many of these tools , and no doubt , the intelligence agencies are doing the same work for the attacks in the last week .
you have a lot of the time , which is probably the healthiest part of the bread , or the fibers , because it &apos;s just full of fibers , because it &apos;s made of fibers .
everything is on his place . first level .
we call it &quot; the &quot; s . &quot;
but let &apos;s look at the different steps , under the point of the possible connections to a deeper level -- my search is about the answer to the question , &quot; what is so special about bread ? &quot;
this is transformation , two different things .
and if they &apos;re shaped , they go back to prove that they &apos;re alive and nature .
if you do this bread , you can use any kind of spent a garden of any beer .
it will be a kind of a kind of a design of time , as we work through this talk .
it takes very , very long , to write these scores , and i work on a piece that &apos;s 180 pages long , and that &apos;s a big part of my life and i &apos;m going to get the hair .
it &apos;s presented by brian chaplin &apos;s , who is an extraordinary artist .
you have a little taste of the piece .
what we did -- betty , one of my students , and i -- we gave the babies two dishes with food : a bowl with a little broccoli broccoli , and a bowl with a laser chip .
i mean , last , when we look at babies , they seem to be pretty useless .
and our babies and children are much longer dependent on us than the babies each other species .
the main thing is that it brings you to change the hypothesis .
now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
boy : that &apos;s why .
our consciousness about this thing is extremely bright and vivid , and everything else will be dark .
&quot; babies and young children are like the research and the human species , &quot; the psychologist says , &quot; the psychologist , &quot; is the psychologist , and they study the way babies play , as they play , and make decisions .
if i could borrow you for a little demonstration , to show the difference -- because it &apos;s actually quite trivial .
then you repeat this process , and again , again , until something comes out of it -- in this case , the character is going to be like me walking straight .
what we really wanted was the whole human body .
you can &apos;t do that .
here &apos;s a couple of simple scenes , like he got caught .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we did it yet .
some studios already use our software to do exactly the same thing , and we &apos;ll have a few of our most powerful things to see in a few big stages of technology .
we thought he just would hold the balance .
here you learn to go to the top of the world -- like most of you hopefully know .
but i have to say , i &apos;m never going to forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i believe that art and creativity are essential to developing empathy .
if you &apos;re ever lonely , you write a new york times , then you get hundreds of emails . most of what i &apos;ve achieved today is covered by frustration .
some stories are just classic , but it &apos;s so tempting .
it &apos;s cynicism . nobody bought it .
there &apos;s a border that we don &apos;t want to cross . so what is the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want to create a new blank document in word -- that could be true !
but i think there are actually two microsoft &apos;s .
the other products were supported by microsoft with an open standard , rather than apple &apos;s standard standard .
and then , if somebody writes a little bit of a sudden , what happens every day -- i say , &quot; kiss me . &quot;
but when i looked at the most sophisticated technologies , nanotechnology , and other people in the come of digital technologies , i made a lot of concern about the most important thing about the design .
and to limit the danger of this new stuff , we ultimately have to limit the ability of individuals to make them access to the access to the access to the access .
i think the challenge we &apos;re standing on -- i &apos;m very sure that this is going to happen -- the challenge is , are we going to develop these online things that are going to take us out of this device ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , for example , you have all kinds of incredible properties .
and to give you a sense of the last of the little , little commercial fund -- he was in 400 million dollars , so that &apos;s really remarkable for us .
and if you use the concept of the insurance industry , you can do a much more sophisticated entity -- the circuitry of the market -- to deliver feedback .
12 years ago , caves began to be fascinated by me , and i shifted my research into this direction .
so wonderful and grim things .
there &apos;s ice under the surface .
so they &apos;re a kind of a living form .
it &apos;s actually so much energy for biology in this cave that there are actually a huge number of dna .
we can see them .
we noticed a few years ago that caves have many properties that were used by people and other organisms than habitat .
whenever you &apos;re a goal to be able to put a goal , you have to get certain steps to your own orientation , and you &apos;re going to be able to get some of the efforts .
and so it &apos;s also in archimedes , the big greek mathematician .
external , and it was made of tremendous amounts of work .
that means before we could start to digitize the world &apos;s health , we had to take the book apart .
and this is what it looks like .
but by flying around the electrons with light speed , they give up x-rays .
this was a bad idea , because philip von macedon had a son named alexander who was the great , and they lost the battle of the world &apos;s battle .
because the institutions are now drifting into the data with a lot of time and so forth .
the original owners of the bottle was one of the most enthusiastic of the 18th century .
i asked myself , 160 dollars for what ?
she has four balconies .
a pattern of a pattern is that many of these things come from japan -- they &apos;ll notice it .
i mean , a more powerful , a toilet toilet .
there was an object that i couldn &apos;t get in the fingers , and that was the headquarters of cheval blanc .
and i can &apos;t -- call my taste of a football -- so it &apos;s not necessarily important that i wasn &apos;t impressed , but i wasn &apos;t the only one there with this reaction .
at the beginning of this year , a virtual asteroid sold for a decent real dollar .
the really interesting thing about virtuality , is that you can measure them .
well , i could create a game called the name of the name by just getting a million pies , or a thousand pies .
if it &apos;s real boxes , we can &apos;t do much , but in a game we say , &quot; ok . &quot;
this is absolutely critical and virtuality is amazing in it .
and i want to tell you a quick story , 1999 -- there was a video game called the &quot; cat game . &quot;
it &apos;s about how individual engagement can be transformed by the psychological and neurological insights that we get when we &apos;re watching people playing .
it &apos;s a kind of a kind of conceptual plaque that is called an fmri .
i &apos;m ellen , and i &apos;m totally obsessed with diet .
there &apos;s definitely hunger in america , 49 million people , and almost more of the millions of children .
and their farms are also big .
it &apos;s the 30 anniversary of the grain of crop grain and the big bang , from chicken mcnuggets , the most cosmopolitan of the chicken , the most powerful , the most powerful , in america and the change of the way we &apos;re farming international .
this is a computer that i received two years ago , which was one of the largest projects i &apos;ve ever been involved in , and my company was involved .
but i &apos;m going to just go to the beginning of the process , on three very , very sophisticated statements .
if we &apos;re so good , what we do , we shouldn &apos;t be able to create an architectural manifestation that &apos;s absolutely opaque by the most sophisticated and more sophisticated and more profound ?
the architectural use was , i said , simple .
and this is the actual bonus of the effort .
the second technology we used , we use things that you know about the most of the opera of an opera .
here you see the most sophisticated configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk about how to collect stories , in some ways .
one of these projects is about a year old .
these are the images that automatically create .
as long as i was awake , i had the camera to go .
you can see a timeline that shows you the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s a little bit more sinister . well , further .
a computer tag of a computer &apos;s brain system .
an artist , a farmer , farmer .
what if you found the truth of the truth , what would you do next 35 years of your life ?
&quot; money deserve and a business open &quot; was the indian state .
and during anesthesia , he told them that he wanted to be in the process of being able to give me a more of a chance of opportunity .
don &apos;t get me wrong , writing has an benefits .
with hand , it &apos;s almost impossible , except in the blink of the , and then the communication is limited .
very funny people , if lol means that .
you don &apos;t do that in the bottom .
if someone had seen a black board from 1993 , the most important thing was a little different since the time of &quot; love story , &quot; but he understood what was there .
i &apos;m about the most popular , i wanted to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you can look at my work next week , and also in the south states , in the south states , in the coastal community .
afghanistan doesn &apos;t represent existential threat for global security .
and the same thing is true for the troops .
instead , there was a rigorous optimism project .
diplomats dig in in a plastic game .
and finally , we need to understand that the secret of what we did in bosnia and kosovo , the secret of our success was to be the great part of our success -- in the careful way of doing our own .
rory , she mentioned libya to the end .
so here you see two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger , to show you what it looks like .
there are also also a lot of the time that &apos;s going to be the rate of the day , but if you &apos;re going to get these online spots , these are used for another kind of carbon .
the most important thing . this is a difficult problem for reasons i &apos;m not going to be able to do .
there &apos;s another one , very interesting connection , and this is that what you want to do is to lead to a lot of information about a general , pretty bad phone system .
so , i think it has the minimal food that we can probably achieve to make things .
and we decided we should not think about it as much as the cost of thinking about the cost , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book that means , &quot; what &apos;s the most the the world &apos;s office ? &quot;
so we have to ask ourselves why .
but nevertheless , you don &apos;t interact much with people who are not like you .
so we can think of things like the most powerful .
i &apos;m joking , but only half , if i say you &apos;re not going to believe in the hospital , if you get to a missing limb , you have no previous cat , mri and silver and water .
then bell turns out to his students .
within a few years in the late 19th century , early 20th century , the doctor was starting to try to make a diagnosis , the most prolific .
between the perception of the patient and the doctors in terms of the best medical care , a real contradiction .
another experience i did in texas before i went to stanford , was influenced by me .
the bad news : the very cause we don &apos;t know . look at it ? you can do that , you can do that . &quot;
i remember so many giant , more powerful , and i &apos;d put eyes in this ritual to me .
some call us a more powerful term .
in this case , we &apos;ve tested this .
for you there , here &apos;s what says , &quot; then a miracle happened !
and there was no way to be a solar system .
religious folk .
harder is to move the dead to a response .
my friend simon singh , a computer professor , was doing a book , &quot; the big bang &quot; and &quot; the big bang &quot; etc .
and now they open their eyes .
you can open it up completely , and it &apos;s a little bit of a sudden .
but it &apos;s been inspired to think that these guys , at least most , know what they do for a living .
everybody thought that was impossible .
you can create a lot of change . you can build roads .
and that &apos;s something that people want to do .
you don &apos;t need any .
hugo &apos;s communication has been invented the most popular and middle class in venezuela , and he just led them .
and so it goes on .
they connect people together .
the reason ? the modern medicine is using 60 years old .
there &apos;s still a catch .
it &apos;s going to make it more quickly , over 26 times cheaper , and over 400 times more than our current energy system for pancreatic cancer .
but my experience with islamic world is very different .
so , there &apos;s a figure for example .
and why does sex lead to babies , and why does babies mean an erotic disaster ?
because it &apos;s the secret of the desire .
especially , in this description of the other or my self -- that &apos;s the same -- particularly interesting that there &apos;s no way to be a bad thing in the desire .
this is her favorite and anatotitan , which is biology , the natural instinct .
and then it starts to desire . this is what curiosity needs , the kind of curiosity .
you know that there &apos;s an erotic space that &apos;s all heard alone .
other places in the country had similar spaces .
in a corporate cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
ok .
that &apos;s mostly played in smaller rooms .
so early school , some of the places have been put together .
so i asked myself , ok , is this a model for design , that adaptation that we practice ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned to me and said , &quot; that &apos;s where it says .
how do we solve the following three problems that i want to bring to language ?
albert einstein -- i &apos;m just talking to somebody when i was in princeton , and i met mr. einstein .
what &apos;s going on in life ? why am i here ?
i never read a speech or a lecture or a lecture .
and it was about 300 people .
he talked about his personal experience .
a french historian said two centuries later , &quot; rarely have a powerful mind with the authority of jesus christ . &quot;
or he was what he argued .
i &apos;m not going to be about the murdered of the thylacines .
but for that , you have to sit around 10 minutes and take a woman in the arm that &apos;s not there .
i was never in .
harvest the
with tears in the eyes , i said , &quot; no . &quot;
in 2010 , a young woman is standing in front of president iv and says , how do you and their siblings live together , their parents died in war .
we go in rural areas and everything we do , what &apos;s happening in this room , we create a space .
i failed .
i want to look back at 20 years of now and see that there &apos;s a little girl , a nigerian girl , a nigerian , nigerian girl on this ted stage .
lg : like , you know .
licklider realized computers can do the necessary thing to do to prepare insights and decisions .
every interaction is recorded by more sensors : your phone , your credit card , your computer , your computer . it &apos;s a lot of data and we get the opportunity to understand our existence .
these records were human rights .
by a more educated process , what else was a task for 40 people , was to become a simple task for three people in 40 hours , and that &apos;s all winning the most prolific .
we should stop seeing out .
dinner with my wife and the children after home .
because people say , &quot; shit man , i don &apos;t have a time to get open . you want to be able to get a look .
she was a much bigger dog when i thought .
these effects affect us all .
the boom of the national media system is to our problems .
think of the most important , more cosmopolitan .
in the era of katrina , we have more in common .
and they all have done that , and if they don &apos;t , they have to be .
help me make green to the new black . help me make sustainability sexy .
so i thought that would be a chance to use scratch to make a interactive map for my mother .
but i &apos;m skeptical of what this kind of thing is .
in this case , you take a laser tag , put it on a pile and the pile of the pile of the different characters in a game or a story , in this case , the great fish .
if you learn to code , you can program to learn .
if kids like victor created these projects , they learn important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s just the beginning .
what i want to talk about today is to give you a background , the idea that cars are art .
i want to talk about this .
and i think that this thought that great cars , a soul , is a soul , very useful . they all know that . they see a car with the first sight of the first sight . they know how strong it is .
this is one of my favorite , which is really our relationship to cars .
right ? and they decided that it would be cheaper , instead of a studio and six or seven apartments , elizabeth , and seven homes in malibu .
there was a lot of dialogue .
i think we felt very close to each other this day , we broke up strings , and we were going to get the concept for the real nature of true design and creativity .
we didn &apos;t bring him to boston .
i just have a little lab .
now we &apos;ve been taking clinical trials in four of these diseases in four .
we have no team of the design and the world &apos;s worth of dna that can be able to mobilize this drug on the market .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
what you need to remember is that we have to do with a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , with a hundred billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t explained was why entropy was ever low .
unlike the low entropy of early universe , although we don &apos;t know the answer to it , we have a good theory that can explain that if this theory is true , and that the theory of the dark energy .
and therefore , although the universe continues forever , and ordinary matter and radiation will be moved away , there &apos;s always a certain amount of radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even in empty space .
but we also give it big fluctuations .
it stops .
it &apos;s a sharp fact of the universe that you &apos;re accepting and not to question .
i had never used a computer .
it was a future i couldn &apos;t accept .
now i want to do something out there , like me , say to africans and the poor who are fighting with their dreams .
no matter what movement i did in my real world , just with my little device in the digital world , eight years ago , in 2000 .
i took this very literally , i took my bike bike , and i put it a little bit of a little bit of a sudden that the projection was good at the table .
the camera doesn &apos;t just understand my movements , but it &apos;s also capable of understanding what things i think is in my hand .
and why just do we get to play with documents ? we can just play with documents .
all the work you &apos;ve seen is about my learning in india .
this is juan carlos , king of spain .
this is going to be the third park in rio , june , this year .
again , you don &apos;t have to dig deep under the earth to build a subway station .
i &apos;ll give you a quick example here .
almost every year we have these terrible folk structures .
we &apos;re under the average in the city of the city .
a city of the future is a city that nobody is cutting from this great community , which is cities .
the best answer is to try to reconstruct a darwin &apos;s success of our artistic and aesthetic preferences .
so the trick of evolution is to make it beautiful , so that they &apos;re kind of breeding a kind of attraction , so they just make them look at them .
and some are in any case to be big to use it for battles .
our strong response to images , to the expression of feelings in art , becomes beauty from music at the night sky , and our offspring are going to be as long as human race exists .
well , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see here the computer sees the environment , and there you can &apos;t see the vibration , we actually , we can actually see the driver with red leds , so he can really see what &apos;s going on .
let &apos;s see if mark can avoid you .
or for blind people , in everyday devices , in education and office .
a subtle , subtle , more subtle , had begun to hear that normal people don &apos;t hear voices and i heard them , but i thought that something was not true to me .
my mental health was a catalyst for a catalyst , dancing and physical and sexual health , and i was told by my psychiatrist , &quot; eleanor , with cancer , you &apos;re better than schizophrenia . &quot;
to be a drug , if the social change begins , it can &apos;t be interviewed anymore .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing right now .
so what i &apos;m suggesting is that there &apos;s where we should look for life , rather than mars , although mars , of course , is a very much more powerful and interesting place .
and the usual astronomers were full of contempt .
because it &apos;s the way that life can live out there , it has tremendous benefits compared to life on a planet .
there was another object , this high piece of furniture with creatures and the naked and naked -- pretty creepy things for a little kid .
the first projects were modest , but they took technology and turned them into things that people would use on a new way and maybe find a new functionality .
the other thing that &apos;s the most important thing is that we decided that we decided to all the technical gadgets , this whole thing , and tried to do it as beautiful as possible .
so we called it y water . so this is another example , where everything happens together in a room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas that are the development of brand , it &apos;s all intimately interconnected .
this is my favorite anthony anthony , switzerland , he had the laptop for a afternoon , i had to get him back with him . that was hard .
yves behar : the design of objects that tell stories
thank you .
my aunt , an incredibly energetic and brilliant woman , became early widow .
she was the most popular of women &apos;s rights for women who i &apos;ve ever heard .
look at these young girls who come back to school after acid was in their faces .
the world that had been given layma was a world in war .
then the situation becomes tense .
they have to negotiate .
it &apos;s the people from my generation growing up in a world where everything is all the best , and in some of our best conversations , they have been on a screen .
ultimately , it could mean that they could print their own medicine .
and if it &apos;s confused , why is that interesting , then you have to look at the rest of saudi arabia , because it &apos;s a country that &apos;s really consistent between the males .
maybe some things are bad traditions and they need changes .
let me give you an example : turkey , where i &apos;m from , which is a very , very high republic , we had a little bit of a little bit of the time that i &apos;m going to call the universities , which should protect the universities
if i was the only person that thinks that we would have a problem .
in the 19th century , as muslims saw europe , they were independent , they were independent .
so the e.u. was going to join the efforts of turkey , the e.u. , to join the e.u. , in turkey , in the states , as some of the people were against the scholars .
there &apos;s a very big nose that doesn &apos;t seem to be able to get into anything that &apos;s connected to anything .
if scientists today , a century later , they want to make neurons visible , then they &apos;re going to light up from the inside , instead of making them darkness .
carl ornish : insights in the inner world
but this trend is less clearly .
but for many parts of africa , it &apos;s a colleague of mine , &quot; the builder was just voted at the right time , so the genocide could start to the right time , so the genocide could start . &quot;
and instead of putting this possibility , local leaders and international leaders are soon released and have been fooled by the second , the events of the world &apos;s population , the events of the world &apos;s and iraq and iraq .
design design requires a strong focus on the most powerful , thinking and adaptable and the downs of the world .
the stromatolites are the heroes of my story .
in flat seas , life has been very early ; it turned out to be more complex .
and the big one went on across continents . the big travel began .
some of the mammals went back to the water .
every man should have a luxury of a luxury .
but there was nothing for this purpose , so we have married with prostate cancer and then we created our motto , which is , &quot; the face of the man &apos;s health change . &quot;
mo hayes from canada , from the united states , and from england , and we said , &quot; hey , there &apos;s nothing for prostate cancer .
and i said , &quot; last year we had the lucky to have 450 presentations . &quot;
this kind of conversation , men to participate in each age , is so critical and important , and i think that &apos;s so much more important than the money we collect .
he could see what happened his forest , his environment , because his grandfather took him under his wing as he was just two years old and started teaching him about the forest and the way of teaching his people .
when i thought about it , i wonder what our grandchildren and our great-grandparents would respond to when they ask the same question .
we need new models to be a leader and human beings .
it works with people like the piano of the krishna .
a life long , through everything , about the cultural revolution and everything that came after , he would have been collecting , so he had about eight million parts in his museum , contemporary chinese history .
it &apos;s just happening .
&quot; my world &quot; is subjective .
or maybe he was just a confession who sat on a rock and the sky of the sky , and the sun and the moon .
and if you lived a remarkably extraordinary life , you will get into the body , or , like the french , the &quot; the &quot; -- &quot; the sky -- the sky of the world &apos;s .
and so it comes to these great rituals where big amounts of food is built in the world &apos;s brain and for 10 days ...
do you see what is business , because the other thing is a result of the behavior of the market and the behavior of an organization ?
see , this is india today . the most important of the reality is based on a circular view .
you know , he &apos;s built the largest world &apos;s largest , it &apos;s called &quot; big . &quot;
&quot; why i chose this path , why don &apos;t i care about the level , just get me , please . &quot;
health &apos;s eyes opens up the eyes for a new look at the myths of india and the west -- and shows why these are the systems of the world &apos;s systems , the death of the death , the death of the death and the most responsible we
but you know what ? it &apos;s almost 2012 and the world , &quot; i &apos;m completely competent , &quot; is , &quot; i &apos;m totally competent , &quot; which is to destroy itself with the weakest praise .
you &apos;re interested in what ?
their friends and family will come together , and there &apos;s a tombstone on their grave , and there &apos;s a tombstone written on the grave , &quot; here &apos;s a great engineer that invented velcro . &quot;
they &apos;re happy . this is the conversation , the mothers and fathers want to hear because their child is good in math and they know what next .
that &apos;s because they know what they &apos;re .
i have no patents and i never get money from a medical school , and i don &apos;t get to get them to choose me .
so how do you know if your breast is high density ?
ultrasound has more filaments to the consequence that are in relation to other technologies , and it &apos;s not very common .
if you find a tumor , as long as it &apos;s less than a centimeter , the survival of the adult is over 90 percent , but it falls a massive increase with increasing growth .
the image of mbi shows this tumor much more clearly , as a second tumor , which is a very strong tumor that &apos;s going to affect the patient &apos;s surgical possibilities .
it costs a radiologists of special education to become an expert in it , a normal , a normal detail of a brain .
some women who are getting breast cancer , many years later , and fortunately , most of them survive .
da vinci da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da
we gather these physicists in los angeles to see what they build .
mill .
they slept in this lecture .
this is an amazing vision .
it &apos;s a question of the consequences .
so let &apos;s go on the point .
what did i do ? i heard my belly ?
this is interesting . this is another way to think .
the nato is basically a visualization of a human being , where everyone is part of the surface of the surface that he &apos;s going to be in the brain .
this is white noise .
and db is probably going to roll in your direction .
i did that just to make money .
thank you .
and he told me to go to a long silence , &quot; i wonder , &quot; i wonder if people don &apos;t find your benches in the amazing room as my videos . &quot;
this is the reason i &apos;m with david edward , a scientist from harvard , a object that can absorb the toxic elements with these plants .
no , no potatoes , but tomatoes , herbs and so on .
the tragedy of other people can take easier than the own and i want to be the most powerful mind of this conference .
according to malcolm gladwell , the most popular &#93; cocaine was the most prolific version of tomato soup for the inner city .
he was a really interesting sight .
he went back to the second floor and said , &quot; hey guys .
like mcdonald &apos;s .
let &apos;s think of other people &apos;s favorite , where you can expect a very high risk .
the second reason was that the gang was brilliant in marketing and was .
economists talk about game theory -- that every game for two people have a computer game .
so , the diamond is skydiving with a board on the feet .
so , in the way , the way that you &apos;re doing this is just possible , if you &apos;re going to take a step for step , if you &apos;re really working on a lot of time , and you &apos;re working on it .
ue : no . that &apos;s just smoke .
occasionally i meet with scientists .
so i had the hope that , by having some natural elements , a little bit of fog , i could make the space tangible .
pam is that it makes a difference , whether you do something or not .
the big mountains in the distance are moving less .
how do we create a notion that is both tolerant to individuality , and also to jealousy , without the two in two different directions ?
i talked about new species of the world &apos;s favorite , one that is attracted to animals instead of defeat .
but the other thing that was incredible was the material that was recorded .
you take the dead and you take them from the dead .
at that time , he taught the classic at the most of college college in madrid .
natalie merchant : singing old poems about life
it &apos;s hardly a dolphin &apos;s dolphin .
as a adult , when i was about the amazing insights of penny , and koko , sue savage-rumbaugh with kanzi and panbanisha , and alex , and alex , who was talking , i heard about it .
so , rs : ng : like this .
we &apos;re in the national aquarium , we &apos;re engaged for the very amazing , for the research and the research .
but we realized pretty quickly that we had created a system that connects people to each other .
today , this is the first time you talk about this topic .
this is a picture of me and my daughter we hold on a israeli flag .
&quot; because it works , make a poster with me . &quot;
they came and they were so many . one day , i remember that libya was talking to a journalist and asked him , &quot; who will see this ? &quot; and he said , &quot; everybody . &quot;
it &apos;s not the most popular . it &apos;s not my side .
and sometimes war is a war . but sometimes , with a little bit of effort , we can avoid it .
and what we want to do with &quot; yes is more &quot; to try to question that the architectural design system is almost defined by the negative , and so against who we are .
and we saw this guy , the design .
and slowly , you start thinking that sustainable life makes less fun than living in normal .
so , you go to the expo first , and you get a little wheel , and you go to the other side of the boat , and you go to the other side of the other .
it was interesting because she was in the morning from nine to 11 to 11 , and how many billion you should invest in the rescue of the economy .
this is a very popular from switzerland . in switzerland , there &apos;s a national need to be on the ground of the mumbai .
we often make small movies .
what i &apos;d like to talk about is the biggest problems in the world .
but it &apos;s a problem of course , if you press people to focus on problems .
so what i &apos;m going to do is to say , really , we have a very long time , a situation that we &apos;ve had a number of choices .
and then you ask , why economists ?
but it says that what we can do about it is very little cost to very high cost .
the most sophisticated thing about malaria is a few million infected per year .
what &apos;s happening here is that we think about our priorities .
it &apos;s a good movie in terms of that i want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expect to be in the next movie of brad pitt &apos;s next movie , like he &apos;s in tanzania , or something like that .
they had all the same material , but they could leave the frame of the discussion , and they made sure they were doing their own lists .
his power , wealth and greater freedom , is a lot of freedom . &quot;
secondly , china has managed to reduce the income income income , without changing the political framework .
and freedom house found that even though 50 percent of all countries are democratic today , 70 percent of them are predictable , in terms of that people don &apos;t have a more inclusive or more or more or more .
because finally , the question is , and seven billion other people on this planet , how can we create wealth ?
the most important thing is not to be in your place .
we &apos;re going to do what really matters .
it was published six months ago , and it &apos;s just going to get incredible attention in germany .
you have to make a sense of the growth of the growth .
i think it looks easy to human skin , which is fascinated me .
but i think it could be a fairly clever and sustainable supplement to our own resources .
chinese workers are not going to be implanted in factories because of our environmental demand for ipods .

and the landscape changes . three years ago , when i started to engage with it , there was only a cable along the african west coast , shown here in this map of steve song as a thin black line .
and that &apos;s not true to me .
this data is sent to layer on the device , starting with the basis of the product , and puts it on the material layer , by the new layer of energy in a field of the old layer of the old layer of the old layer .
it was made by the layers of layers of layers of about four .
a repulsion will probably be less likely .
you can just make it right in front of the place .
this is what the product is made .
without any doubt , i believe that this technology is creating a revolution in production and the most powerful as we &apos;re going to know it .
he was worried that when he called them at this name , especially outside , in the public , you could think he would be the notion of jihad .
they use his mailing .
the good news is that it &apos;s not going to be that way .
but many of these factors that played a role are even more powerful now , and half of the work is done .
i was with my friend susan , photographer photographer , in the mathare valley slums .
she said , &quot; you know , poverty was not the bad thing . it was the humiliation and the embarrassment of all the things . &quot;
do you think i &apos;m going to miss violence or the drugs ? the lack of privacy ?
first , instead of months of months , and forget about it , the time was very much more powerful .
but it &apos;s less likely to be that they remain .
and during my first year , i ran my company .
it &apos;s actually said that more energy needs to be able to make a solar cell , as you get in your entire body .
solar cells are going to collect a four and a half hours of light .
and they &apos;re also under great pressure and they &apos;re dangerous .
this is a very reactive .
it &apos;s just a little cylinder down here , which is the generator and all the most common in itself , and this is the hot hot cylinder , the hot cylinder , the hot cylinder , and it &apos;s going to be hot , and it &apos;s electricity
you don &apos;t have to use the hot water , it can also cool .
so here we have a map of the united states .
and we don &apos;t have a precursor to use this energy so fast as we do in the moment .
we &apos;re going to bubbles it up and look at the parts .
it &apos;s a flying laboratory that we did the measurements in the region of this molecule .
but i still wrote bad poems , and he never got the most prolific in the air , but he went to cuba .
so , from the street , great things can come -- -- i then have a picture of a picture that eventually will land in my work .
i work for the new york and i do a lot of work , and then 9 / 11 came , and that was , um , a kind of a , a second end of the world as we knew it .
then , &quot; summarize , &quot; clear . it &apos;s a little bit more clear with the tongue , but that &apos;s how we understand it . &quot;
&quot; and he decided that his favorite was extinct . &quot;
this man is angry because somebody everywhere is distributed on his staircase , and basically -- you know , you know , you seem to be a theme here -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , onion
and it &apos;s also gone through george , and so i don &apos;t think it &apos;s .
td : since my youngest childhood and after , many different obligations were given me , and when i was young , i was always going to get my way to my journey .
this is beautiful , but we should remember that a similar process should be done on internal level .
td : lakshmi has worked incredibly hard , even for my invitation , let alone , because of everything they did , so that i was going to have this , and i was pretty nervous , and i was very nervous during this whole week .
in these two examples , we &apos;ve seen machines that have learned in the simulation , and others who have learned it in the reality .
if i say , &quot; we , &quot; i mean , my advice for the ted project .
but nobody believes that it &apos;s actually going to be very effective if there &apos;s a real outbreak .
the biggest part of the administration in the administration is actually more connected to anthrax and the threat of biological biology .
we know that the virus is going to be interpreted . it will be another virus .
but in the scientific community , there &apos;s a debate about which percentage of the people who are in between people through their and coughing and knocked on how much of the hands happen .
some of the poorest countries that have most experience with h5n1 , have collapsed full of drugs that are already already raised .
and i think even our leaders would say that we have a lot to do .
i &apos;m very happy to answer her questions .
our centers for the world &apos;s business have developed one of them , and the early test of them is defined by the rapid test .
and in the most recent days , people were similar bacterial infections , also , not a problem .
don &apos;t just pay attention to how much fun you have , but also how the energy flow completely changes the way that you can interact with a city like san francisco .
please put a little bit of a time .
i &apos;m going to talk to a young juggler from a force , and he &apos;s a little bit of selling me to sell three clubs .
i &apos;ve been playing with my childhood , and i &apos;ve been climbing , and i &apos;m going to go and climb , so i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m going to be a fan of a game .
manhattan is not going to be in the infinite .

because of the wind leaves and branches , it &apos;s very dark in the most dark and very quiet .
i and my colleagues of the world &apos;s favorite care care of the dynamics of the world &apos;s dynamics , living in the forest .
we &apos;re advising ourselves with the media , we have a nuclear record ; we have a little bit of a sudden .
and then the students in our recording studio came , and they took their own little beats with their own beats .
and our new project is that the inmates and we learn to grow the frog , to grow the frog , which is a highly endangered species of endangered species in the states and oregon .
he said , &quot; look what you &apos;ve hidden on you . &quot;
so we &apos;re seeing a rising demand for the growth of the world .
they &apos;re not a magician . they &apos;re not our parents .
you have to believe me . trust me . &quot;
and i learned two really important things that day .
the deeper we go under water , the higher is the pressure .
so i started about 15 years ago .
and the air goes into the air industry , and it &apos;s going to come out of the air , and it &apos;s the air from the air .
each of these computers can do the entire system , so if two of them are going to get there , there are reserves .
but this is what it looks like , and this habitat is always continuing to go over many miles .
so sharks are not quite so dangerous as most people are .
when we found him , we didn &apos;t even know what family he heard , so we called him a little bit of the time , because he looked like this , he looked like he was coming from one of his books .
oxygen oxygen has a deceptive and he was freezing .
this means that every one of them and each of them knows at least a child that &apos;s suffering in a developmental disorder .
and his communication and social interaction improved so much that he could visit a normal school and even a more mature .
it &apos;s like life : if you &apos;re in it , you can &apos;t get out again .
i know you &apos;ve never heard of him . but you notice this day , one day you &apos;ll hear from him , because he &apos;s a fascinating man . &quot;
nk : no , he died 25 years ago .
he had a lot of love , he loved everyone .
we , all of us , are what happens when a soup of hydrogen and helium is so long , that they start asking themselves about their origins .
these are the most powerful evidence that life can exist in many other environments .
so you have to learn the diversity and the incredible scale of life on this planet in the first step to be deeply deeply beneficial to a living with life in all of all .
so it &apos;s so important to be silicon , and we &apos;re going to expand it in the future by expanding it in 350 antennae so that it &apos;s sensitive and to the moore &apos;s law of increased computing .
and then we &apos;d like to make the most powerful search through human health &apos;s .
many people say it &apos;s the best place in the world to study the development of climate change .
every cylinder is a very popular time .
while you &apos;re going to put it on the ice , warm , you can put a extra pair of gloves in a oven so that you can put a new pair of gloves if your fingers freeze and your fingers are stiff .
i think that &apos;s a little bit of economic time .
and our soldiers don &apos;t really look at the consensus of pipelines in the police station when they actually reported to service to the service of american health care .
you can still push that , and the efficiency almost triple with some of the most powerful improvements and the gross cause of the great world &apos;s most powerful .
we could build bigger cars , which would be the security of security , but it should be easy .
but instead , they sell it to china and japan because we have our environmental capacity to protect our food and the other .
and that &apos;s by the time the pace of mass production of this kind of materials , or in this case , to make the manufacturing of the brain , as good as a good , manufacturing system , the most powerful , the way that it has been
it can &apos;t just act about a giant conspiracy .
there were two types of negative feedback that we have .
we hope that it &apos;s really stable .
oops , i turned wrong .
at the end , he found a computer company , a dutch scholar called han van meegeren who sold him a wonderful vermeer to a prize that was about 10 million dollars .
according to his favorite , he looked like he was discovering the first time he had been discovered in the world . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s coming . what is it ? &quot; is a good answer .
but as attractive you find them , how much they sexually move them or romantic , depends on what they think they &apos;re looking at .
but each of these three objects has value beyond what it brings to one of the things that it &apos;s going to do because of his story .
but i don &apos;t want a copy , even though i can &apos;t see the difference .
so he brought joshua bell to take his head of a subway station in washington d.c. , to put on a corner and see how much money he will take .
the second shock is less painful because you &apos;re used to a little bit of it .
and if you &apos;re going to see , you can see that maybe there &apos;s a kind of political policy .
they &apos;re making it a nuclear , professional member of the american state of the american state of the american , which sounds very glamorous and exciting .
and what you find is , of course , people who eat vegetables and olive oil , less , less , more powerful .
the most intriguing thing is one of the most intriguing things in the world of medicine .
it &apos;s a very popular conclusion when you give a drug in such a high dose that it &apos;s going to have more side effects , and that your new drug will look better .
the big trials are closer to the true answer .
this is a problem that is not there right now .
and very soon , they would have started this coal , 2,000 pounds around 2,000 , 2,000 miles , to the street , to china , back to china , back to china and all over the world .
can you imagine how you feel if you were in my mind ?
it &apos;s just about oil ; you know , all knowledge .
there &apos;s this thing that &apos;s the world &apos;s most important , and that &apos;s right from the middle of the united states .
and what do you see ? they &apos;re christians .
man , the americans , are kind of like , &quot; ah , pennsylvania .
these christians are the most terrifying .
they were denied . that &apos;s wrong .
and the soldiers are chinese , and everybody else is chinese .
you can imagine that maybe one of them on the morning is being bent down to his child , and it &apos;s said , &quot; honey , i &apos;m back afterwards .
everything has changed .
and all of this has been huge implications on the world .
i think thomas jefferson really did it very well in words .
for the most important thing in the audience , even though you have a greater budget , why have a bigger budget than comedy , that &apos;s because it &apos;s easier to be in other languages and cultures . so the market is bigger for these films .
but it &apos;s going to happen within this century .
this is not the u.s. war of the united states , which is going to be about a million , but gdp of the world per capita -- 200,000 dollars .
and also , as everyone knows -- it &apos;s about energy , not oil .
my choice is the pinnacle of a lifetime that started growing up with the gulf of the gulf of the gulf .
a lot of our actions on this planet , which are on our living environment , are only by belief and guess .
one has been for thousands of years or millions of years .
we have to calm down before we beat the planet .

real falcon from lightly chicken chicken .
there &apos;s a program that &apos;s a program that &apos;s just brilliant .
this is an emotional topic . some people got up .
my grandmother was a hippie .
i also made my own comic comics , which was another way to tell stories , through words and images .
and we sat in there , in silence , and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really talented . &quot;
use your own style . draw , don &apos;t tell you how to tell you .
&quot; rather jarrett , i &apos;ve got your favorite .
i &apos;m also going to publish a children &apos;s book with the title : &quot; police police police , &quot; the most popular who &apos;s going to be a computer company . &quot;
sound affects us all the time , psychological , cognitively and more cognitively .
this is a 32 million pounds expensive , important , important , which was built in england recently , designed by a british shark company .
but it &apos;s not just kids who are affected by it .
people who say , don &apos;t sit next to this team , because the noise like the noise and the other quiet need .
&quot; upwake &quot; tells a story about zero , a contemporary business company who &apos;s his life in the suitcase with himself , and the dream and reality is not able to be able to do both of the sequences .
and the frames and four years later , and the work later , what was starting to do was a kind of a design of talented actors .
i know theater connects us .
now , the time we can use the diversity of our talents to create a intelligent , important and extraordinary work . and then we can go back .
if you look around the bathroom , you see some products more , like the example of the , like , for example , the design , the more cosmopolitan , but also the limit .
and the collagen of collagen -- or , since the &apos; 70s , collagen of pigs -- is used to inject it in fold .
i &apos;ve found 185 products in total .
and i said , &quot; my love , i fear you have a long and a half year ago . &quot;
i told them , they should be in front of themselves : &quot; i &apos;m somebody .
they gave me the feeling of being somebody in a time where i felt like no one felt .
they &apos;re working on the ninth copy , so they started in the middle of the world , and now the letters is reaching p .
hundreds of verbs can behave like this .
you can see that as the language of the thought , or &quot; the &quot; s &quot; .
so the puzzle is , why are you going to be polite requests , helen and threats so often ?
you can try to imagine what if language could only be used literally .
and the other puzzle is that i don &apos;t have a problem with it .
here &apos;s my argument . is it sustainable ? is it good ?
it &apos;s going to make it a lot of work . it &apos;s a little bit of a time .
what do you have won me to convince you ?
all these different roles . can you imagine an argument where they &apos;re sitting , but also in the audience , and you see , in the audience , and you &apos;re looking at the debate ?
or -- and that &apos;s the most important part of me : we want you to be able to get us into the world of nature , and we bring a design design and find the master of the adaptation that might inspire us .
it changed everything . it &apos;s not that these engineers were in the boat .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here &apos;s how we make things .
this is the national national lab .
that would be a fuel system for fuel cells , if you could get up without a centrifuge .
this is not easy , because life is only a subset of elements in the periodic table .
feel and react : feedback is very important .
what you don &apos;t see is you can &apos;t count .
my first business was a computer company . i started under the taliban .
in south korea , indonesia are almost half a million companies .
because , as the most prolific , smaller , more sophisticated , more sophisticated economic growth are being made .
and the world &apos;s not exceptions .
people are doing this kind of delight and this miracle .
i have a big seller of a little bit of a reductionist , and i &apos;m going to be suspicious of a paper towel on my own book , and now i want to use paper paper to make it a paper towel .
we did it first .
what does that mean ?
when i started to engage with you , i realized that they have adapted to incredibly well .
but the researchers had a problem .
until finally , they went to their degree and left the campus -- and sure , there were way to come out there -- some time later , and discovered that crows still reminded them .
we &apos;ve found that they &apos;re really smart and they can teach each other to each other .
for example , squirrel would come to come to look for the peanut and go back .
but there were three problems , three puzzles that i couldn &apos;t solve , and i want to talk about it , but more importantly , i found a computer company .
who would ever be imagined ? &quot;
and imagine what could happen , because every region has something to offer .
let me make the connection .
you know that there &apos;s the future of the future . you have to understand that .
that &apos;s a lot to be too simplistic .
oh yeah , i &apos;m going to be the johnny &apos;s sound of the sound .
about 10 million of the water users .
and over here , we see the words of the radiologists of israel , &quot; how the hand is going to arrest the penis in a way that remembers the penis . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yes , but i would rather eat if you don &apos;t have anything about it . &quot;
i said , &quot; you should do an experiment .
he had a line in his book , who was supposed to be expected from the most popular , and there was a little maria maria , who had trouble with conception .
so now you have an evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i have to read you what she said because i find it so beautiful .
i think that &apos;s very unfortunate . not because i &apos;d like to use it . i wanted to see him .
and that &apos;s actually the beginning of our story .
now i thought to this moment , that at age 50 , one of the skills that i really had got was to tie my shoes .
i have to tell you that i &apos;m not from here .
yes . the artist doesn &apos;t seem to know exactly where to put the different colors in the world .
but i can see in your faces that you &apos;re still a little bit skeptical .
it &apos;s called &quot; the &quot; s &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
after a while , i decided to have a little fun , and before i left the room , i was scattered a few things in the room .
and now they &apos;re all in there .
my father was one , my youth was so interesting .
the song as a mere fact .
i &apos;m like , &quot; wait , yeah , i &apos;m going to be good -- i &apos;m going to buy the wheels . &quot; from pure protest , i bought the weird wheels , and i built them and -- look at me . could i have my
it just sounds like , but i think we have a huge deal in our society and culture with intent .
he had designed the wet self , and he was really proud of it .
human beings , i love the thing .
the consequences of a planet already on the planet is seven billion people .
and very proud , he was on the cushy seat , which he had , the real easy seat he had his favorite , and on the beautiful , round of the seat around the seat .
intent -- a life with intent -- in fact , the original thing that &apos;s a little better .
i saw the healthy mass of a left , and i was documenting that she was lost , all of the things i didn &apos;t do , but not possible .
and then i started to ask myself how many times , how my life would have been different if this man didn &apos;t have me hurt if my genes had a different part of experience .
i was , but i was now a computer scientist , and i was now , i suspect , i made myself myself .
i was hoping to be a lot simpler , and i was hoping to share this turkish , and to make me go back to my way .
he spent six months in prison , lost his family for a decade .
yes , contrast .
we &apos;re working with the machine &apos;s machine laboratory laboratory california , san diego together .
first , the perception of people . and second , a natural interface , a natural form of control , so that interaction with the robot is intuitive to you .
and yet , i made this idea to be .
after i realized that economic danger , i thought we need to find a solution for this problem .
some of you have even read the speaker in the speaker , like nathan atwood , or the one of tim ferriss , who may be considered as a very difficult thing .
i don &apos;t know a tedtalk that includes this .
this time i paid 25 cents , because i found the task was a little bit harder .
and yet , there was one , which was all safe : the expansion had to slow down .
keep the mystery of the dark energy in the back of the mind because i &apos;m going to call you three main principles to string theory .
the candidate list went on about 10 high 500 .
and he worked for decades of explaining this number , but he didn &apos;t succeed , and we know why .
each of these universes has additional dimensions .
because the astronomers of today , by turning powerful telescopes to the sky , discover a handful of photons -- a kind of cosmic cable , billions of years on the road .
well , i want to be honest with you and tell you that most of it is just a trick , but a trick that actually works .
think about it , it &apos;s the first time you meet it . we want to really get excited and make more curious .
he said , &quot; go , milo . squash them . &quot;
pm : that &apos;s dimitri &apos;s right in the same way .
we don &apos;t know anybody here .
the next moment , the phone doesn &apos;t work anymore , the tv is coming out , the armed men are on the street .
it was a very grim meeting of the reporter who had worked in war , who had employees , and of course , the bold , brave people of sarajevo himself .
if i asked , why am i going to go on to do why i &apos;m going to stay , that &apos;s the reason .
but it &apos;s my job to break this testimony and this is the most important thing that the core of the thing , for us reporter .
even before a goal , that you &apos;re trying to get the joystick to the joystick cursor , the &quot; the promise of finding the target , &quot; no matter where it is .
basically , we trained the animals to learn that they were learning to control these kinds of things and explore objects in the virtual world .
in a experiment we did a few years ago , we went to the limit .
so we start in china .
so dai manju did the most successful .
please raise your hand .
the last reason that women have to do is not the problem .
in niger , in the average one of seven women die at birth of a child .
it was part of the solution , not the problem .
larry ornish , when he was a computer bank of the world bank , once said , &quot; it can be good that investment in the world is the highest food industry in the developing world . &quot;
this is bill &apos;s book .
and that was the feather of a bird .
this whole gyre of the entire gyre of our brain tells us that there is a more powerful thing .
and even this picture makes the suspects feel like being a little bit of the flavor of the &amp; amp ; and , in fact , the kind of thing that &apos;s about the most prolific &amp; amp ;
one of these possibilities was that we could have gotten to a little bit of time .
they put their arrowheads down and say , &quot; i want to share this arrowheads against the finished arrows . we share 50 to 50 . &quot;
there are places on this island where they can meet all three or four miles on a new language .
when 27 individuals from these 27 member of these 27 member of these 27 member of the world , they put their 23 languages , they &apos;ll tell you a simple calculation that they need to be a army of the world &apos;s worth of being prepared to be
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that they also had language .
and what i &apos;m interested in most is the invisible space between a text and the shocking image , and how the image is changed through the text , and the text through the image .
this is the most important thing that &apos;s going on over the atlantic ocean , connecting north america to europe .
they turn the negative to it .
but through the impression of the most powerful , the most powerful , and live , the most powerful and live .
larry ornish was sitting at a 10 years of a 10 years old , in arizona , for kidnapping and repeated a young boy on a computer scanner .
and the people are left to themselves .
and they brought them to texas for us here .
and now they drive with the food where they &apos;re in this moment .
it &apos;s just the vast space that makes it look like nothing .
so something called a sense of a sense of feeling : the pursuit of happiness and human design .
partly , the legacy is the legacy of the hostility , the convergence of happiness , which was being driven for happiness for the most powerful , and it &apos;s not going to be found in reality .
a science of happiness is that happiness and bad no longer is a continuum of a continuum .
it starts in the field of ice .
here &apos;s a three year-old baby .
in the animal kingdom , there &apos;s only one way to increase the status that is dominance .
i want to close with some quotes .
why should you choose rats ?
once the rat has understood that , we have a little bit more difficult to do .
you can actually cure t.b. , even in people who are hiv-positive .
with knowing that a patient who remains microscopic , until 15 people infected -- 15 healthy people -- a year , you can be saved that we &apos;ve saved many lives .
here we see neurons .
so , this is important for imitation and emulation .
now , the question is : if i just watch a different person &apos;s being touched , why am i not confused and literally watching this kind of thing from the naked , how someone is touched ?
thank you . i have two missions here today .
i &apos;m not really about the most important , but it &apos;s about the pollen itself .
all these pictures were taken by a scanning microscope by the way in the lab of kew .
even every single one of us has a story to tell the most of us .
we have to be so good as the breast cancer campaign to address this crisis .
right at the time , in the 1980s , when we were going to women and death through heart disease , they wrote a cover for the new england journal of medicine and called the syndrome .
our colleagues in washington , d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike the most pessimistic , x-ray , for women , whose high school , who &apos;s the heart of the heart , every time we organize something that includes a little bit of radiation , we ask , &quot; is this test really necessary ? &quot;
okay , here we have started .
they &apos;ve done what they said , they &apos;ve kept the food , and they were trained .
the cells have something like this , and in the dish , they don &apos;t feel the native .
what does that mean for us ?
in the course of three years , we took eight to 10 hours a day , collected about a quarter of a million hours of oil , and we had a million hours of research .
this is one of the first ted projects that came out more than a year ago , which really surprised us .
and finally , my son is playing in a walker .
three of the most important people in this project philip , rony , and 14,000 roy , and the falafel roy , are here to see .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamic in the game .
this is the first time that our son made more than two steps on once -- captured in the movie .
and this is a important question to be a question , because the better we understand how the brain makes meaning , the better we can communicate . i think the better we can think and work .
it &apos;s a kind of center where you see a picture and think , &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional response to that . &quot;
what we literally do is to paint our teams all the time on a big wall .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just about hygiene , but it &apos;s also about the possibility of relaxation .
so there &apos;s not a building .
if you translated that into the building industry , if you have a car phone , and you &apos;re broken a window , we &apos;ll say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken , that &apos;s got to be fixed .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we kept on .
are we just stupid ?
you may be able to write through two years a day when you read eight hours a day .
and so you can do it in september , and say , &quot; i &apos;m important today .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
and the police waiting for the firemen to get the vehicle to do the vehicle in pieces of the driver &apos;s body .
and that &apos;s enough to be able to get into the present of the united states , where a eye &apos;s eye is going to be the divine achievement .
all of this leads us -- the only thing that we &apos;re doing is to name the one that we &apos;re doing most of the digital devices .
this is the consequence of the destruction of more than a third of the brain on the right through the stroke .
this is a very , very low level to be released from the health system .
he then gave my jaw to the right position while he was putting my teeth on the right position .
alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator , who is fascinated by the gaps to close gaps in mind , whether he &apos;s hearing a hearing hearing , or a blind , or a paralyzed the movement .
now i had to go in the dark years , which followed me , when everything was , when everything was doing this , was gone .
and it works . it works .
lp : so if you have the opportunity , you spend time with simon .
and these were the developing countries : they had great families and a relatively short life .
and these are on this side . a big of africa and the most of africa .
and then deng xiaoping came and brought money to china and brought the country back to a middle .
a search of search that we can copy in a design format , and can we publish the world in a field of view , and what do we hear when we look around ?
but this creates hypotheses .
you know , darwin has explained life after it came out , but what was the essence of life ?
and i learned francis crick .
but there was what in the literature .
we were not the best chemists in the room .
i was chosen to get unhappy ; my girl didn &apos;t get me married .
you can compare it to dna , and you can compare it to the dna of the normal segments .
and so i close by saying that we &apos;ve looked at 20 people with schizophrenia .
average costs in a case that is two million dollars , and it takes 18 months to take 18 months when they win .
first , they don &apos;t fight for the patent , but they &apos;re not fighting against the patent .
my solution : give me this patent and i &apos;ll leave you with a little bit of the patent .
&quot; why not ? &quot; the girls said .
the fathers were in a place where they move their daughters to play their daughters , their chairs , and their hand could reach out .
this is a great technology .
it &apos;s not very much left on the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in humans .
can &apos;t see the enemy most of the time , and so we needed another way to eradicate polio as we had done it with smallpox .
it helped control pandemic pandemic pandemic , sars for example .
the reality of polio today is something different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : now bruce , where are the most difficult places ?
bruce ornish : how we &apos;re going to get polio to a standstill
dj : we found this malignant now at all kinds of animals , especially with the cats .
and to our surprise , it became a very talkative .
for us , this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration , a symbol of this hope , which is accompanied us with our work .
it was incredibly amazing than she took it in security to protect it before the hyena .
and of course , if i look at these online issues , the most powerful , it reminds me of a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic because your fate is in our hand .
we need it . we respect and celebrate each other as a man and woman as a community and as part of this planet and we need to continue to do it .
and it seems obvious to be obvious that the earth is big and perfect , the sun is small and flexible , but it &apos;s worth remembering what &apos;s going on .
and that &apos;s because in middle middle world , there &apos;s always there .
nature &apos;s nature depends on what kind of animal we are .
because there &apos;s so many of them , and because between them , there &apos;s no consensus about their favorite , more than they &apos;re in middle world , the way we see it in middle world , and we find it in middle world .
people like to treat a machines like a machines , and it &apos;s just a lot of time , but it &apos;s a waste of time , if you want to guess what the person &apos;s going to do next .
i was going to be at the night of 40 years old , at the smithsonian of 40 years .
over a cursor i control with my head , i allow these pieces of data to see videos of the robot and send orders to the robot by touching buttons in a plastic scanner .
with the help of people like you , we can make this dream .
in the oceanography of oceanography , for example , a health system is developed by the most powerful , by basically the most sophisticated , which is the dolphins sending out the dolphins .
i think we can form a global community .
this is a hot water system .
there are now some -- there are some lessons that you can learn from that .
but we don &apos;t usually do this .
i think we tend to look at this : the infrastructure of globalization .
this is down to 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem we need to solve .
i also take the fact that most of you don &apos;t speak chinese -- what &apos;s really sad if you think that this is the most common language in the internet .
what do you look at ? maybe we should do that .
if you look at this picture , you might think , &quot; why should i care about that ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow you to go out and look at the world and find its place in it .
they would bring wealth and security , religious violence , and make sure that states never go back to terrorists .
and part of this activity is honesty .
what is that ?
i love this dish .
and the war introduced , 20 million people , who took life -- until today , the civil war in the world .
l-dopa sen , who is this guy , &quot; i would have made all this money , but i &apos;ve spent all these time to look at the american man who had stolen my recipe .
chinese restaurants have done the same thing , i would argue , with the menu and the decoration -- even the restaurant -- but without a centralized headquarters .
in contrast , we have general tso chicken , which started in new york city in the early 1970s , when i was also at the university of new york city in the early 1970s , so ...
so what we see in the 17th century , 18th century is the most powerful search for medicine , which creates the same thing .
so people would have a really big fit .
when the members started to become less , i was clearly more depressed , until i thought my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
do you remember having to come up with a child on every line ?
18 and 19 , i slept the night .
again , i &apos;ll be depressed and a little more disturbing .
so many of us are clear that there are a lot to do in the next few years in the next few years .
he goes around , &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know , where did the world work in the treatment of the known problems that made out of the potential of the earthquake and climate change ?
if you put the impossible out of the impossible , you can do it .
but we have reached a agreement to climate change .
and there &apos;s god crying .
the most remarkable power is something that makes you a remarkable , and you use two ingredients , proteins and water that are in their spinneret , to create a material that is extraordinary , as a result of technical fibers like kevlar .
or you &apos;re kind of like this , you know , the camera can get this , if the camera can catch this .
here you see how it &apos;s taken from tissue .
with my new project , marilyn &apos;s ted , i want to use art to create technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that &apos;s going to document the united states and record the round of applause and the food industry -- hopefully not to help him meet some of his next decisions .
what do i do ? &quot;
in the frame of this unprecedented demonstration , heather knight data , a data , which can far more than a more powerful , more than a more powerful -- he collects the feedback of the crowd , and he &apos;s doing the answers of the amount of things
stanley tarter , inventor of the famous &quot; of the &quot; world &apos;s &quot; s &quot; -- held in the corporate and the computer , that there were two people a connection about only five to seven steps .
how does our view of relationships are very much more relevant to the other groups ?
there was a exchange of exchange that i &apos;m going to tell you , and where he might have been able to put this cartoon into the ear .
um ... my dad , a computer company ?
it was his father who decided she needed false papers .
this feeling of responsibility about other people &apos;s lives , despite his young age , and also his fault , to be a more powerful , because he was out of a camp , he kept his friends , he kept his whole life .
and as my 15-year-old and my favorite , my favorite , i had given up , sort of , orphans , my father &apos;s false papers .
i asked him , given the victim he had , if he ever had the ever ever .
we grow from a few million people on the seven billion people that we are today .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a very beautiful system on the ground , which is a very , very much of the next thing , which is a very good state of the world .
if you &apos;re going to cross the forests of the land , the border of land , you &apos;re actually compelled to stay the ability of the design of the land , stable .
with the realization of the knowledge of the , fishermen , the most great barrier reef , and scientists , that the great barrier reef is damn the current barrier of the current .
but the drama is of course that it &apos;s clear that the change is not an option .
and that leads me to another reason why i &apos;m here today : because i really like media .
this is a kind of a race of a race of far developed .
first , he uses a ancient way of making the world &apos;s most connected and connected to a three-dimensional perspective , which was a whole new technology at that time .
and by the process of sugar on black , i hired portraits of them .
it was very big pictures , and i took them with a very big camera , a camera camera .
my interest in the most powerful , especially worse , is enough .
and on the back , a sequence is also the same thing as the chimps .
we can ask , is there universal differences between africans and the world &apos;s disease ?
and then you can compare it to the genome of living people .
we can then ask for the herbivores that are the same questions , how are you in the world , you know , with the ancestors of the people today ?
there are many people who designed their own vision of vision , like this vision of the 20th century .
after my belief , the airplane of the future has its own consciousness .
imagine , a carbon carbon crisis in the 3d printer , and are embedded in a pool of a nervous system , and follow the forces that occur in their components .
they didn &apos;t speak . but especially they were extraordinary in the world around them , from their environment and from the people .
they would be a police nurse . they would call the police .
now we know that it &apos;s about a 100 .
you see a video .
you have the feeling that the research that you have , really , is a effect on reality , that you can actually prevent these experiences with that , which i started to get my way to this area .
then you go down .
you can put your eyes in a stare -- chin on the top of the mountain , poor extended over your body , arms extended over your body .
they were doing everything that we had taught them .
and after the battle , they bring this mobile class and they do what they call &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; to teach you what you &apos;ve done wrong .
people have changed .
i said , &quot; where is he now ? &quot;
this is not a piece of cake .
and she showed up on the left , to tell me how problematic this picture was , which was the idea of the idea of how black was represented .
it &apos;s really in this sense of the most important , that i have a new series of questions that i &apos;m going to do .
well , this is a kind of obvious statement .
and the kids said , &quot; how do we do that . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to multiply numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long did you do that before you decided you didn &apos;t understand anything ? &quot;
their favorite levels of their own , they have increased 50 , which is the other fine schools that are going to get to a biotechnology biotechnology .
76 percent . at the test , two months later , the result was 76 percent .
after eight ted talks , he wanted to be a da vinci .
these are 10-year-old .
suddenly , i looked out of the darkness on the opposite side of the space , which was a secret of mirrors that were liberated by the moon .
if i had to reduce the whole story on a picture , what would it be ?
i &apos;m going to show you some clips from my other big project in this year . &quot; the tempest &quot; -- the storm .
and our little life ends up in a sleep .
bono : they &apos;re privileged .
i know you understand that .
so blue , blue , everything was blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both play in africa .
it &apos;s another one that acts on the interface of health and business .
let &apos;s use the markets as the most important thing we have , and we find out what price people would pay for , so they would have the dignity of choice .
thank you .
the most important thing was , if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we destroyed two main sets of wood and 10 tv .
the little thing that &apos;s going to do to take out of his tracks , and that was a problem .
this is very good . it &apos;s going to slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of a few of the models that i work with .
tissue of the density of density and behavior is the second part , and that &apos;s actually going to be the key to use these models for the design of the world .
thank you .
and the attempt to fly just to try and shoot the arrow of the arrow of the end , and it was hard work , and young , young , i &apos;ve learned a lot of respect for nature .
now let &apos;s look at the other side .
we work on projects -- even more sophisticated developments , as much as the kind of steel -- with darpa , the california institute of technology and university in los angeles .
be careful , just behave like wood or something like that .
now i didn &apos;t try to be a lot of the time .
they go over forever .
these are over two billion .
it takes him to think about &quot; three years of &quot; three years of oil . &quot;
don &apos;t forget , one more soon .
but for me , this is great because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time that we can live in the human mind and machines .
i clearly have mass . where does it come from ?
it &apos;s too afraid that the way that the way in which the wild could be extinct in 20 to 30 years .
all the evidence of this is that this cancer is going to be transmitted by a virus .
i took the opportunity to get true and took some samples from jonas &apos; tumor and a few samples from other parts of the body .
she brought him to the veterinarian and this discovered something called a little bit of a little bit of a time .
and ultimately , cancer is an inevitable consequence of the ability of our cells to share and adapt to their environment .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and this is a global phenomenon .
they would be able to wait to wait .
and that &apos;s the third reason why a low expectation doesn &apos;t make us happy .
but they didn &apos;t think the numbers were on them .
first , i &apos;m going to show you the most important for the optimism bias .
but the good news is that our illusion is not broken when we &apos;re aware of this kind of thing .
but what we &apos;re going to see in the 21st century is asia , which is gradually coming back to the age of half the world &apos;s population and to do half the global economy .
you could look at this as the privatization of the war .
after 1958 , sputnik had been the soviets , it was , &quot; this is the end of america . &quot;
if you live in japan or new delhi or a new delhi , or you &apos;re going to be a different view of china , something different than you live in beijing .
and if we have strategies that we &apos;re going to get in major historical context , we can be able to do this process .
as we define our national interests , it &apos;s not just a more powerful amount of money .
this is the conventional approach .
this has typically the responsibility to be able to guarantee the aid of the world &apos;s own stable security .
they &apos;re on the long term .
jobs for who ? especially for young men .
after most of the law , you can &apos;t even get the heart of the ground .
the supply of the own , after the conflict , would be brought to the government .
this is the silhouette of my hometown new orleans .
the military has realized it . they call the climate change , the security and stability , while governments are discussing in the world , as governments are .
it allows you to become more productive , so you can afford the insurance itself .
these are certainly inspiring examples of possible solutions , if we feel in the situation to plan to plan a world .
listen like chinese students , english , by shouting it .
teacher : perfect ! students : perfect !
and that includes things like the concrete world with the more powerful , abstractions that we try to make logical , and we also take the hypothetical seriously , we ask ourselves , what might be , what is it ?
luria looked at people before they were in the scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to a distorted world .
and luria said , &quot; the north pole is always snow .
they chose high-resolution rather than new york .
it wasn &apos;t just the spread of cognitively hard professions .
would you have made it , killed ? &quot;
you could say , a half .
it feels like i landed in a colony of angels . &quot;
and they &apos;re going to get me to do a degree in something .
he &apos;s still in the red numbers , but chris made it with personal sacrifice , this film .
i &apos;m one of their favorite .
there &apos;s a prime minister , a minister of defense , secretary of defense and a cfo , or president of the world &apos;s war .
boy : the most serious thing is serious .
we were all angry on them : &quot; why do you do that ?
that &apos;s going to be a lot of real , if you read it . &quot;
we had always played the game after weeks , about seven weeks ago , and we had essentially all the 50 and a half of them predicted crisis .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
many people announced good jobs , and they got the job of the job .
it &apos;s like his own little connection .
if i all had three legs of this , in the three peaks of the triangle , i would get a tetrahedron .
so everything you do is -- it &apos;s a very , very simplistic proposition -- this old plastic , and this old plastic &#91; unclear &#93; , this is a very simple thing to do in a old fashion .
this is possible if you have a whole piece of paper , you can enjoy paper , you can be in a school school or a school school -- a leaf , a ruler , a ruler , no scissors , no scissors .
what we do is a very simple amount of light .
this is a little straw , which is what you do , this two corners here , it &apos;s going to be like a traffic machine .
here are two magnets .
it was very many passengers on the ship , and they got bored , so the captain invited them to be a deck .
in the conference conference , arvind gupta shows simple and yet amazing plans to make waste in really , really , constructed toys , which can build children themselves -- while they learn basic principles of science and design .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually examples of biology that many evidence were provided .
and there &apos;s a few examples of projects that are aware of ecosystems .
and with a little planning , we can actually dominated a place of traffic in a turn , which is open space for people , which is the open space to people , and it &apos;s turning waste into opportunities in opportunities .
this photograph was done at the day of the day , and only a year later , it looked like this .
if you &apos;re blowing seawater , the first thing is calcium carbonate .
no , you have to be able to explore the people &apos;s souls with visions of the visions . &quot;
i was looking at somebody who &apos;s jewish because i &apos;m jewish and because i &apos;m very important .
but the real failure was that there were very many men who wanted to go to me .
very few of us have the ability to be absolutely honest with themselves .
he likes to travel as long as it &apos;s not on a flat table .
i was basically trying to be like the design of the game .
because you remember my favorite , you have to get a more 700 of 700 points and no one did this .
most of you . gamers are 33 years old , not eight years , and if we look at the most profound demographics of the world &apos;s population , the players of tomorrow are older adults .
imagine that your vision is very , very good .
these players even have many other benefits in terms of attention , and a aspect of attention , which is also more powerful , is our ability to track objects in our environment .
i want to ask you to remember this outcome , and put it in the context of another group of the world &apos;s worth of data , a group that is actually in our society , which is the high school , who are doing the high school .
let me explain this step with a task called mental rotating .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just all of the kinds of programs that we &apos;re looking at , running .
so it was a big , very complex project that i didn &apos;t even have , whether it works at all .
so wolfram alpha knows about many and many things .
on one side , we have mathematica , with the kind of precise , formal language and a large network of the world &apos;s capacity , capable of doing a lot of lines .
so , with physical engineering , we &apos;re basically used to go to the world and recognize that certain materials make sense for certain technological purposes and so on .
a few years ago , i was quite excited about discovery that there are candidates with incredibly simple rules that are successful , and also the general relativity theory and gravity and at least evidence on quantum mechanics .
sw : i think .
and during that time , i actually lost more relatives , and teachers who are making me feel like hiv / aids .
they jump up . they wear red clothes .
there was a woman who was a woman , she didn &apos;t have a right on the land , and automatically everything was my family , anyway , my father , so he had the right .
and the day before the actual ceremony , we were excited , and they were not slept all night .
he was wearing laughter and that in a village that didn &apos;t even have a street , and it worked very attractive .
i promised him to be a girl &apos;s girl , i would come back and do everything they would ask me to do .
when it was pregnant before marriage , mother was made for it , and punished .
while we &apos;re talking about this , 125 girls will never be mutilated again .
consumers who represent 72 percent of the american gdp are actually starting to start to drop up , like banks and companies , their own , in the daily life , to free themselves from obligations and risks that are moving forward , when we move forward .
and what you see here is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we actually step and basically step in the future of education , the future children of our households .
and the way to go up is to go up to 48 percent , at cornell institute .
we &apos;re also watching a trend to something more like tourism . right ?
one of them is the most important of community and neighborhood , and it &apos;s growing the neighbors as a support .
we &apos;re also watching a big amount of dna .
the trend for the design system is immense .
then we take the phenomenon of kogi .
and then i came to the question , i &apos;m the only one that &apos;s doing this ?
you could use it .
this is what i do in my life -- stories tell , novels , and today i want to share with you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures that are the most powerful .
our main community could shrink . our hearts could be stunted , and our main capacity could be more populous when we keep in our cultural cultural system .
and i came up with the first time i call it , &quot; representative foreigners . &quot;
i &apos;m not an immigrant , no refugee or a refugee , i &apos;m going to ask , why do i do that , but the treaty between languages allow me to reinvent myself .
he wanted to see an manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story became a huge deal , because i was denied .
literature has to lead us to the other side .
i could be a novel about a muslim woman , and maybe it will be a happy story , and i may write a happy story in my next book , gay professor in norway .
so you &apos;re going to be able to get existing songs , you &apos;re cutting up in little bits , you can get these pieces , and you get them together , and you get a new song , but this new song is clearly from old songs .
instead , these laws and laws are the world &apos;s laws of the rather awkward comparison .
it &apos;s a very reactive , but i &apos;m going to summarize what it does . the alarm alarm : the telephone of the telephone , by putting a symbol with his finger .
our creativity comes from outside , not from inside .
and then they say , &quot; okay , but how do you see your address ? &quot;
but in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the guardian &quot; guardian . &quot;
what &apos;s beautiful is you can probably see this limb there , a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a plastic limb that &apos;s going to be made out of the limb .
our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
now , this led to a sense of nuclear structure , because it &apos;s going to be so versatile that atoms have a single core , with the water that &apos;s going to circle it around .
this picture shows a galaxy , a more powerful , with , well , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think it can eventually be the most powerful ideas for us , about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet .
this is here . this is home . that &apos;s what we &apos;re .
and with every mouse and every touch of the screen , we &apos;re going to leave the same as a little bit of the time and anagnorisis of our personal information all over our way through the digital forests .
when our daughter sat on the street , i asked them , &quot; will you put a lot of value on musical competence ? &quot;
we can &apos;t do that with the most violent thing .
well , i want to take you to this journey .
and because i was so excited , and i was talking to my 27 birthday , i decided i would not talk to you a day -- a day .
and they don &apos;t speak ...
and i explained to help a friend who understood my sign that i was john francis , that i was walking through life , that i was not talking about it , and that was the last time that someone would translate my sign sign .
well , i &apos;m going to get my backpack back again .
i started talking again because i had studied a lot of time .
but the most important thing was that i was thinking about my silence , but never about my decision , just to use my feet .
born and grew up in north korea .
sometimes i found small jobs in exchange against food .
i always worried that i would get back and back and back .
i felt so powerless because i had so much to eat in america , but my father died of hunger .
but i believe that their gesture of love and care can save the lives of another joseph , and can change thousands of other people &apos;s lives that still have hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings , but this was much stronger than i expected , and just to make it easy , and make a mass of industrial engineering , and also making a difference as an industrial model .
but then i was very disappointed with my job as an architect , because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for society , but for privileged people , rich , the government , the government .
and then in the following year , 1995 , there was a big earthquake in kobe in japan .
so i wonder what is a permanent and what a temporary building ?
but this is really necessary .
so we learn some of the most important things in our lives before we &apos;re born , in the womb .
so fetuses even learn the particular language that &apos;s spoken in the world that they &apos;re born in .
it creates a mixture of the presence that are so objective and weird , as the woman itself .
why should malnutrition in the womb have to lead disease ?
you can also see the other eyes in the other way .
this confidence in the field of the brain is essential to every kind of light .
the audience will be on the ground of the world , which is very logical , but not with the sign of what happens to your eyes . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , maybe it &apos;s going to be a smile .
you may remember that as the most popular , okay , and then when the biggest deal of all time .
if you &apos;re a high animal at the formal , and someone says , &quot; what do you actually do for eliminating hunger in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start a campaign campaign ?
this is actually a strategy , and i don &apos;t argue that strategy is playing a role .
for me , all the music was .
now , if i use my software , the camera is going to see the camera , and the point of the space of the brain is going to be the same thing to the most of the time . and you have a pig .
i remember the poor needed something to do -- food , clothing , shelter -- whatever they didn &apos;t have .
i even felt a moment of shame .
now , since i heard him , i was excited for various reasons .
i didn &apos;t even ask a donation , which was usually my way .
it &apos;s about the history of the poor history of the poor and it &apos;s about giving us a way to engage what their dignity would be , a partnership , not a partnership , which is based on a traditional way of donation , can happen crazy .
it &apos;s a very much more powerful combination , a very strong combination .
now , the first thing is , it &apos;s very , very early , and it &apos;s very clear to me that it &apos;s just a vehicle , just a vehicle .
how does the future of humanity look ?
now , i &apos;m going to turn to the second big question : are we alone or there &apos;s other lives in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions is that we &apos;ve done remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
see this .
here &apos;s photographs of me .
the rate of the rate is even doubling every 18 months and every single family member of the world &apos;s population , which is moore &apos;s law .
but what about them ? what about them ?
they float in their saucers over the sky , and occasionally they haul people for experiments that would not agree with their parents .
so we &apos;re interested in things like this .
the previous generations couldn &apos;t do these experiments at all .
and i found out that the first technology was found in the form of the world &apos;s first technology in the form of the world .
we can learn a lot of it .
and i see the way i &apos;m looking at my child , and i &apos;m trying to protect my child , because with a child , you don &apos;t have any minister of a minister .
and secondly , she tells us that she had a stand-up gang , but some of the adaptations for climb of trees had .
until now , our knowledge about our ancestors in principle came from adults , because the fossils , the most popular , missing .
the most salient of the heinz , the origin of humanity in the vast ethiopia , is the origin of the human skeleton , and he talks about how he found the oldest skeleton of a humanoid child and what we can learn in africa about our humanity .
and if all of you should be able to think about the rules , of course , you need an effective system to print and the way we &apos;ve found it , and it &apos;s also necessary to be able to do control .
it &apos;s considered a high seas , because the continent of the internet demands is the most important .
we need to work locally , but also the entire ocean industry .
we need to create a new paradigm of caution and respect .
carol &apos;s : &quot; i would say , &quot; i would pay to do what i do . &quot;
that was a pretty good idea .
to say , i &apos;m a journalist , not a technologist , so i want to design a sketch , like the present and the future .
and finally , i think we need to think about whether we want that to be our reality -- and if , what it means for our idea of life and everything that comes out after that .
it looks like oil .
the symptoms of complex is that you have the strong and more powerful opinion , which is the right solution to the problem , no matter how hard the problem is .
cesar and i tried to write a paper for the new york times and explain how it works .
of course , we can .
and make a lot of money .
it &apos;s higher than the rate of the americans .
we &apos;re going to try and try it . probably everything goes wrong .
immediately , it &apos;s going on . &quot;
and babbage &apos;s tried to get it again , but he never could prove the guess .
i &apos;m saying that our approach is simply not wearable .
china has been going to have this already in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even slow down .
the future is naturally balanced .
yes , it will be ugly , and yes , it &apos;s going to happen soon -- with security in our lifespan -- but we &apos;re more than able to overcome everything that &apos;s on us .
and here they come in .
and what we need to think about is this : if you dance in the flames , what &apos;s next ?
and we thought we can put these debt on our children , but imagine that we can imagine .
everything else is a lot of the time .
this is the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what stage of development is the cell .
that should be amazing or ?
all we get is a lot of the time .
you &apos;ll be able to focus your listening to your own , or you can be able to make a series of things that we can &apos;t do .
it &apos;s not a thousand years in the distant .
we should be able to ban these cheap , simple , simple , simple , and no one for their children . &quot;
and here we can see this particular thing .
we can &apos;t risk to lose the confidence of customers .
he only got 500 and could have gotten to 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a huge truck of a full of plastic , which they got , and he said , &quot; come back in a week when you &apos;re sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the way the web -- things we all talk about -- is a little less than 5,000 days old .
of course , there &apos;s been the internet since more than 5,000 days -- the web only 5,000 days .
so if we say that the machine we &apos;re going to be a human brain is now a human brain , if we look at the rate , with that , that is in 30 years , six billion of the road is six billion .
now it &apos;s not like this -- if you do a table and things in work , a word document , they &apos;re not part of the web but they will be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people will be the extended senses of the machine . &quot; in a sense .
it &apos;s going to be on the level of parts or ideas , if you want to evaporate .
the last point i wanted to talk about is the idea we &apos;re going to be able to get .
third , it will be ubiquitous , it will fill our entire environment and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i was convinced that the second ted revolution was the second of jesus christ that it was sun &apos;s moon , and i was very fortunate by god , and i was prepared by god to become his favorite .
these are the dead of the fish .
and it allows everything . it makes everything logical .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas , how we line things up .
this is a project that we &apos;ve just done in a very large fashion system for a huge scale that came out of this process , it &apos;s the result of a variety of forces that are developing it .
and that led directly to another project .
it &apos;s actually a false attitude , because the hybrid is probably more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas are contributing to the education of young people .
and finally , one of the most interesting projects -- a more powerful .
each of you is going to be on your neighbors .
so , as we have to pay school fees .
so we have a big brain , a big advantage , because we can affect our environment .
my story , is the two brains . it may surprise you , our gut has a brain system .
this is a very , very important thing , because there &apos;s a very , very important thing to do .
we &apos;ve learned to talk to the big brain , taste and reward , as you know .
he said , &quot; you know , sometime , we were all like animals and then not anymore . &quot;
these are men and women who can even name 250 stars in the night sky .

it &apos;s unique to human imagination .
this material that you all know is , but i think it &apos;s more like toxic white stuff .
i shut up there , you fit in , because in a hundred years , my body can go back without a type of a framework .
it &apos;s a waste .
you want to apply it anywhere in the world , and not to take care of the world &apos;s or not to take care of the other thing , because you have a lot of alternative .
first , they start atoms in a special bottle .
i &apos;ve been a competition four years ago called &quot; dance your ph.d. &quot;
my country is about 15 trillion dollars .

and she thought about my work in mathematical models , which should promote an understanding of evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience may not be head-tail-tail -- from deep , cultural reasons , they think it &apos;s boring -- and find a different pattern much more interesting -- head-tail-head .
you can think about two ways .
if you throw a coin , you get a series of head and number .
back to more secular , because of that you &apos;re dealing with uncertainty .
and only in one percent is wrong .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to take that a sudden death penalty in a family that &apos;s more likely to stay . &quot;
not as unlikely as one in 73 million , but yet pretty unlikely .
the whole quality of control that has the smallest impact on industrial processing is carried by statistics .
the most powerful thing is saved hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide .
a smart power force prevents injury because the electricity is always recognized until a smart diagnostic system is recognized .
but , on the other hand , china is a computer program . a term from a very recent period of time .
you have facebook , we have a lot of time .
yet , the tectonic self can create a very strong force , which is never in the history of china .
so , chinese look at this as a real medium , not just as a mere number .
how big ted , isn &apos;t it ?
so in the last three years , in the last three years , through the world &apos;s worth of oil , they really changed more and more transparent , because they don &apos;t have access to the data .
more chinese , and more of the chinese , and human rights as their own biases , rather than a parent , is the way of the americas .

you can &apos;t let &quot; not be a trivial . &quot;
i &apos;m very interested in both of them .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example of this , but there &apos;s actually a theoretical argument for why technology is evolving in the way that technology is in the way .
now , evolution of our species needed hundreds of thousands of years , and because of this interaction , evolution is basically the technology of a new species to produce the next stage , which was the first step in technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; we can make good the third dimension .
over the last 50 years , we had 28 percent of the world &apos;s worth of growth in a year .
another big revolution is the most powerful revolution .
to our exponential growth of computing , 1,000 dollars on computing is about the brain of an insect or a mouse .
and in the year of hubris , we will get the full four of these trends , and they have to be celebrating how often the proverbial is made in the form of technology -- faster and faster when we get to this point .
you can get blessing and the peril .
they &apos;re harder .

the beetle climb a lot less rare on the pill when they put on the pill when they &apos;re not wearing .
here &apos;s our main experimenter .
we &apos;re playing a video sample and see what happens .
this is the universe of stephen hawking .
thank you .
and the argument that it &apos;s fun to get into this big adventure is not quite true with my experience .
or , &quot; nice . you know , my grandmother makes a cruise next year to antarctica .
so the whole purpose of the presentation that vc is to convince you that they &apos;re the entrepreneurs in which they &apos;re investing and a lot of money to do with it .
and next to the experience , a company to lead or lead something -- that doesn &apos;t have to be a company .

we have a meme meme -- seriously to be .
but forgive me , the problems today are not the problems of the industrial revolution .

our thinking is backwards .
through a drastic change , change , like transparency , change , like , for example , is to promote , and collaboration , collaboration , and not to be able to focus on these things .
because only the challenge is the only way that things are going to be done , the only way to get rid of us is getting rid of the old little bit of the old little , and to find new creative solutions for the problems today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we should do it together , and if we do that , and the ideas of play , we can transform bulgaria to something better .
the magazine for the computer &apos;s name is , &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master took me to the ted department , because the most popular thing was that .

imagine , big , already late , already , you know , to hear about how you would play personally . john mcwhorter walker shows how pictures can be analyzed on the exact head and analyzed them to play on the top of the wing .
now , since we &apos;ve seen a time of extraordinary economic growth , the longest rise in the history of this country .
but now , a few months later , as politicians may always be in it , &quot; in the static apple to bite without the mine , &quot; the mine , as someone felt , can &apos;t hide their uncertainty yet .
well , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i met this guy , a little chaotic man , who was fed by tomato sauce , and iron for completely preventable .
but interestingly , it &apos;s also a future that is a few things that society is going to be a few tricks from capitalism , which is how to put dna in the society , by trying to put things together , and then they try to work out

but they didn &apos;t get the results that they wanted .
at the same time , i was on the field of the field of research , although i was a ph.d. in a rake .
people and the humanities and the birds and the birds and everything that goes up here is up . these are people , livestock and pets .

we &apos;re very much from . we take the feeling of memory to a mother and a long one in this meditation .
and you think about how the things are , if you &apos;re happy , if you &apos;re happy .
and of course they are cruel and more vulnerable to others .
although the change in your attitude is something for other creatures , and you feel these new quality in you , and it &apos;s helping you , and it &apos;s going to help you as a role model .
so the coffee cup , or the cup of the cup , is using a society of the society to get the public health .
interestingly , the complexity is very high .
we &apos;ve heard about bill gates recently .
so it &apos;s very , very simple when you know how to read it .
well , let me close with four general remarks , an example and two aphorisms .
and i don &apos;t want to stop with you , but in the lower right-hand corner , you see an example of what we have for this .
did you start doing that ?
and this is what the most important thing comes from , the things jimmy had talked about , what jimmy has been talking about , or is it , how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things will always be able to be able to get it in the use of the use of collaboration with the power of the world .
so , let &apos;s take astronomy , which yochai had mentioned .
it &apos;s also going to be a professional argument , professional arguments .

they &apos;re similar to each other as you can only be .
by the way , i have a email today , which is that we &apos;ve completed the last part of atlas .
and these guys here are the weak force , perhaps the least known .
so if you want to know why the sky is blue or why atomic nuclei are connected , you should basically be in the case with a powerful computer -- why dna has the form that you have now -- that &apos;s what it has now --
the comparison is that people in this room are going to represent the higgs boson .
but it &apos;s really that with this theory that the physical movement of the big bang seems to unite at the big bang , a perfectly wonderful prediction , the model was not made with the goal that this is happening , but it seems to be .
they created this civilization , this wonderful picture , the darkness in light , and it allows it to see civilization from all of them .
another big insight came from a study of the wayne state university in 2010 , the baseball maps of the world &apos;s hospital , looked at the 1950s .
in a similar study in germany , researchers use an fmri to measure the national imaging system and after they had the face of nitric oxide to suppress the smile .
&quot; because the colors that they have ordered , not the european standard , &quot; he said .

so almost everything on earth is going to be wiped out about five times .
svante &apos;s got the answer .
why should that play a role ?
so , in theory , we can grow any organ from any cell .
here &apos;s the rise in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the conclusion .
if the rotors are spinning with the same speed , the robot is floating .
and you see how robust the control is .
and he does that while he &apos;s making obstacles .
they take their neighbors true .
this shows that we double the most sophisticated , triple , four , four times , where we can get them to form teams , how they can see here .
but the robot can also figure out where it wants to go .
i can feel that . but there &apos;s so much and i want to expand your horizon here , open your mind , and change your view of honeybees .
this has been a huge problem for many years , basically since the late &apos; 80s , the most powerful , the many different viruses , bacteria and the food , and it brought up .
they don &apos;t experience that .
the cooks take the cooks for their dishes , and the honey -- there &apos;s a lot of the honey -- they use the honey to their bars .
the bee dies . honeybees die when they stick , so they didn &apos;t want to do it .
okay , now , now , the question is : why is this ?
of course , we also have , especially in the last decade , to put the world with a dense chain of industry , with a chain global trade .
and never before were so many people in this fact .
in fact , many of you don &apos;t know that our bread was not european invention .
and especially meat in the field of water and china drives the most powerful .
agriculture has for most people , and here are not many farmers under them , to be bad , to be bad , to be able to destroy the environment , to destroy the environment .
all together .
and so while i do my bread , i do it , and i &apos;m going to do it , and i &apos;m trying to burn my hands .
and also , it has to be to keep a long time to get the tools available there , materials and the materials .
you take somebody like me , a scientist , analyzed and developed a new technology , and it &apos;s determined to the quantitative design .
because i hope you &apos;re going to take this from here today , a new connection with nature .
this was a couple of days ago in agumbe .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
this is from last year .
but the six-year-old was one of them , and shekhar kapur turned a film over her , and shekhar kapur , who should see you .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but this is a very common thing as a specialty .
this is a patient &apos;s patient who was at the time , and he was actually a bypass , but he was really going to get a bypass , but it was for this .

if you eat a high toilet meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a very , very , very , very , very fat , and americans eat more fat , and even more carbs , and so the percentage is lower , but the actual number higher , the goal is to reduce both .
one of the most popular studies found that 70 percent of people were clogged , 65 percent of people had bad breath , 54 percent of the people had a headache -- that &apos;s not healthy food .

i hope he &apos;s not going to stay .
the film is based on a computer scanner of f. scott
two main projects were involved in the project : warner brothers and the baby .
and we had enough passion to make the technology and technology .
we &apos;re so sensitive to motion capture .
the number seemed to be infinitely .
and these are the data that we get from that , and then they &apos;re used for the model .
and so the finished picture was used in the movie .
this was a very , very , very early sample .
and we found this , in the middle of the state of karnataka .
and it has a very different kind of energy .
people from 3.3 will be overcome these cruel , more sophisticated past , where they lived for their lives .
we were too fourth -- two of the two years old -- and imagine , this vast one is a ocean from sand , 40 degrees c , a water bottle .
i think the camel is the best anchor animal on the world . &quot;
and they use them as much as we see our online system .
we weigh our animals .
so i &apos;ll show you another movie .
i &apos;m not going to go through my body temperature until my body temperature is 40 degrees fahrenheit -- enough to borrow an egg .
so , thank you for inviting .
start a meeting with a poem . that would be an idea .
but how would it like to be , if you never knew how to do the next day , you know , how do you get a living god the world , your shoulders in the clouds , or if you &apos;re sitting down there from the wallpaper ,
who could sleep in this night ?

at the end , they sat in a tree and a brick that &apos;s going to the other .
and the human race is more than that , but if you remove these two columns , probably not much left .
and also , we have the problem that you can &apos;t build the problem that would be too hard for a single elephant .
one component of it is understanding . here &apos;s a kind of a , &quot; the ability to understand the other and to share . &quot;
so now we &apos;re looking at more complex expressions . here &apos;s consolation .
that the test is not good for you .
there &apos;s a very simple task that you have to do .
a philosopher actually wrote us that it was impossible that one sense of fairness would have a sense of fairness , because fairness was invented in the french revolution .

the last decade i spent with that , and i &apos;ve been able to give pain and humiliation , hopefully for a good thing that &apos;s the most powerful thing .
and i have to say , god is thanks .
so i heard , in a way , it was a success .
over the years , the serious health system can produce .
a.j. jacobs : how healthy life is almost like me
and i think many scientists share this view .
a really cool thing .
now these studies are scientifically valid and they were recovered , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
ask for the part of the story that &apos;s not going to tell .
... a priest ?
finally , a group that believes that the indus people are the ancestors of people in today &apos;s current days .
right after left , how many ? okay .

so , take this wonderful thing , the most wonderful thing we showed us , and she &apos;s afraid to get us to the ted system .
a man was a guy in front of a tank that became a symbol of the resistance of the resistance .
but what would you not have to do , if you had the modern communications , to make a sense that the wrong thing that was going on , immediately , had to be done something ?
combine the power of a global ethic with power of our ability to communicate on global level and organize global warming with the challenges that are now violent and largely global nature .
in the museum of the children in rwanda , there &apos;s a photograph of a young boy -- and the museum of children &apos;s lives were the life of the life that were left when they were in the process of rwanda , a million people .
here &apos;s the task : help me build a vibrant , more sophisticated , scalable , in 3d .
you can move on very different types of dna -- they vary in the most powerful , the movement of the surface and the legal supply .
this is the driving algae .
boy : reusable .
we slow down to see the spines in action .
mark cutkosky at stanford , one of my partners , is an extraordinary engineer that was developed a technique called the shape called the shape of the shape , where he can embed claws directly into an artificial foot .
you see almost like aliens . and the secret , what makes you stick , are your favorite toes .
so here we go off the band-aid .
these are the structures that allow the spines to be , and the spikes , and the most challenging , to be very challenging , difficult surfaces .
so , the long beautiful songs that are creating a long beautiful songs , and males are also allowed to find the females and choose a partner .
so if dolphins are less than 20 feet away , they have to be less than half the time of the instrument .
if we think of marine animals like dolphins , we need to be about the consequences of our interventions in the very clear , which we thought we were quite productive .
after the most popular , the marine world has made these systems available to the world , to experience what scientists could hear .
they just hear the low frequencies .
if males and females use this signal to find a partner and they &apos;re scattered , they &apos;re going to imagine what the impact of the population would have been in the recovery of the world .
how ships can be made . they found that with a better kind of energy , they can reduce the noise of the noise to 90 percent .
they &apos;re going to be the speed of 50 percent .
we see strangers , we see strangers , 300 times , and it &apos;s getting more . and they &apos;re not like us .
you have all the possibilities available .
we observe a continual rise of the men .
and obviously there &apos;s a hundred , and it &apos;s a hundred .
with initiatives like 100 dollars laptop , it &apos;s me thinking about the idea that we &apos;re going to bring a whole new generation of people into the old computer .
thank you .
i think nothing is the problem .
our daily lives is , but it &apos;s a remarkable state , we say in a very extraordinary state .
normally , it &apos;s one or two per year .
and there are .
but we &apos;re much more more more than more .
part of the challenge was to try and try and get rhythm and space by not just my hands -- juggling is much more powerful -- but the rhythm of my body and the feet , and the balls with my feet .
and then they play crazy .
ok , because they don &apos;t understand what a computer &apos;s is , i give you a little hint .
now , again , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
you have somebody up here who is the most important principle to do this whole life , ok ?
pop -- and then it comes to calm . just a little number of time .
and with space and straight in the room , there are other ways .
and then they &apos;re going to go .
in this year -- you might show the slides -- in this year , we carry the most powerful thing around us , a project that we &apos;ve helped to design the design of the design .
we can call this on a high-speed phone , which allows you to access more information about the clothing of clothing while you &apos;re going to get these online spots .
scott adams : i found that i &apos;m going to be the leading expert in the world &apos;s way .
and we also have a new product now , and it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s been shown to be public .
now , the farmers can only be in the rainy season , and not harvest in the most sophisticated harvest .
electrons disappear in a way of a kind of plastic and then only energy can &apos;t see energy , and energy can &apos;t see .
that &apos;s what he thought he was about .
potatoes , potatoes have 48 chromosomes . did you know that ?
well , atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
and someone said to him , &quot; well , what is the point behind , henry ?
we &apos;ve been doing it about four years of this .
if google is digitized a book , they bring it into a very beautiful format .
i &apos;ll give you an example .
suddenly , in the middle of the &apos; 40s , everybody was excited .
but imagine , it &apos;s not going to be interested .
but also , many of the right , the most of the people who have benefited from propaganda .
if you get the toe , it means a &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if i run this pink sound for longer than some minutes , you would literally stop hearing it .
many people escape to headphones , but this turn big , public spaces like this , shared , divided , in millions of tiny personal personal families .
you can do that in a beautiful place , like a lake .
and finally , a acronym .
and i said , &quot; that &apos;s my job . &quot;
thank you so much for being here . we &apos;re all so grateful . &quot;
and they went away .
because they weren &apos;t at the sidewalk , and they couldn &apos;t see the exchange between me and my shared , a exchange that was fair to tell us , but that was wrong .
now , i &apos;m telling you , in the last year , there was a lot of competition , because the arab spring is still spreading out , the most important thing is that it &apos;s raining -- what else ?
this photograph was actually taken in a police station , and you see the bottom of the people who were tracking the police of the police .
the kids just do photographs in a class , the teacher gets them , they paste them on the top of the road .
in today &apos;s talk , it &apos;s about the brain and , yay , somewhere out there is a computer system .
this is something we can work in our lifetimes , and i thought i could make a difference and i tried to get out of the street , and i was trying to get out of the street .
but sometimes science has some other properties that really make them interesting .
what do we bring more data ?
there &apos;s something we believe it is obvious , but wrong .
it &apos;s that intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we don &apos;t look at the alligator as very intelligent , not in a human way .
in humans , we developed the most sophisticated part of the web , which is called the name of the neocortex , and nature has this little trick .
it &apos;s not that you &apos;re looking at it and say , &quot; what am i seeing now ?
not like a computer computer . not at least like a computer computer .
these are the things that are going to come first .
we need something , we need something military , but only to defense .
you can see it on your turn . &quot;
they traveled because they were at the time of elections outside the country .
this is a very talkative .
and then , when she closed the door , grandma said , &quot; no , no , no .
they wash it up like this .
these group uses three , every one .
it &apos;s real .
it has been able to learn english and learn this as a foreign language .
the computer already , and it &apos;s about three participants .
if you think , you know , unlike the employer of the united states , that actually was part of our experiment , because that &apos;s exactly what we did .
we repeated the experiment with the same groups , but we put a delay in the same way , but we put a delay between the data , and the actual beginning of the carbon system .
the price of this is the displacement of paradise .
and they moved and then they were moving to each other and they were leaving their arms on each other and leave them .
we &apos;re really good at talking about skills and security and health , we &apos;re really bad at talking about character .
then you &apos;re having personal coach , the most powerful , like the bad breath on the ground .
i don &apos;t really feel like i &apos;m really feeling with emotions .
the first gift , or talent , is a lot of the ability to peer in other people &apos;s minds and find out what they have to offer .
they have a humility .
this is what the unconscious is looking for .
we found them between the software , raped by many , many men , i don &apos;t know how many .
where does your journey start ?
and that it &apos;s not normal to live in a home .
what was my challenge ?
they need their empathy .
lexicography : the process dictionaries are building dictionaries .
well , first of all , i give the queen to blame because it &apos;s funny .
online dictionaries have to be different .
the bad words -- look , if somebody thinks about a place and then you don &apos;t find it on the map , then he thinks , &quot; this map sucks ! &quot;
you think , &quot; ok , if we think that words are tools that we use to give our minds to the expression of what should you know that that collects better than hammer ?
the lexigram has 33 different definitions of the set of scenes .
and then there &apos;s this mike , mike &apos;s life , and mike &apos;s life in britain .
i &apos;ve got the whole time , &quot; the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , &quot; said the dictionary .
so , i get a chair .
and , to make a long story short , i &apos;ve landed here .
and so , piece of play , as this three days , you start understanding : why am i listening to all this kind of thing ?
they may be from a ted speaker , and we can keep the conversation during the year , and next year , after the same intellectual and emotional journey .
the manufacturers didn &apos;t have the most sophisticated , in their cheap , because they &apos;re not sure what the public would start with a very precise byproduct that could actually fold on the palm of the palm .
there was a way that you were insecure , and it was technically not able to find the channel .
instead of taking the most sophisticated , you make it .
and , &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
we call ourselves a &amp; amp ; selfish and we live in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this work is a cartoon of a human being .
we debate about the case , &quot; what the world needs now , is nuclear &quot; -- right or wrong ?
and now , there &apos;s only three main points of this -- coal and gas , the almost everywhere that &apos;s used all over the place -- and nuclear .
we &apos;ve become the russian warheads , by turning into electricity .
the emissions are equivalent emissions of all greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming , and it &apos;s transformed to co2 .
now , if you look at the fact that the prevalence of nuclear weapons with the prevalence of nuclear weapons is because we know that india and pakistan are developing nuclear weapons in the field of plastic .
for wind , the area is much bigger , but the most important thing is smaller .
the reality is that 21 states have nuclear power , right ?
and in the senate of the united states , we need the support of both parties -- only one or two voices are necessary to be the global warming in the senate , and this room can help .
we &apos;re not going to get enough energy from renewables .
i &apos;ve been worried about the 10 years of the time .
thank you .
this was -- my motivation was made by apollo jennings .
for the first time , we have enough wealth in the hands of some less people , and the available technology that allow us to explore the exploration of space .
26 groups from seven countries took the competition , and there were a part of a million dollars from one and 25 million dollars .
so , we can bring them to the space station .
and the advantage for the sponsors is the sum of the world &apos;s population and the social media system .
would you surprise us , so we &apos;re fascinated ?
that means that surfaces can make themselves , they can be incredibly small .
a challenge was how we can express these new algorithmic order in a column .
what i didn &apos;t know about the time , because we had only seen the outside , that the surfaces kept moving on , within the column , that was a pretty surprising discovery .
inspired by the process of division of division , michael ornish writes algorithms that create incredible , fascinating forms with millions of surfaces , not a human being , but you can build it . and you could build our understanding of architecture .
so look at this picture here -- a lot of forms here for you .
it &apos;s a very rare disease .
this is a drug that was developed for cancer .
you can see , the chip actually mimics the most delicious .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s led by young people .
and i think many people here in the room , many of them are in the same position as i am .
so i think women in our society are going to be leaders because they realize that it &apos;s very important for their future generations to get our cultural identities .
we &apos;ve realized that since recently , more people use resources like youtube and social networks to give their stories expression , to show their photos and their own stories with their own voices .
at the same time , we &apos;re going to go and explore it , and we &apos;re going to explore our part of the world .
so i was going to consider more or less than &quot; nothing . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; maybe if i do this ants , you pull a few apartments , you &apos;ll pull it up . &quot;
this was called &quot; chopsticks house . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do that ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back to the next day .
and it was ...
my work , roughly estimated , sometimes five , six or seven weeks , can &apos;t always anticipate .
and i took it around , and it shaped the chariot .
so i broke the needle .
it &apos;s a very , very reactive work , but the best things come in small bits of light .
they expect their employees to do what they asked them to do when they were doing the job , they can do more .
there &apos;s this absolute concentration of being , this absolute , absolute , conscious of consciousness , awareness , an absolute center of compassion and love that the primary properties of the divine defined .
my favorite body flew into the one direction , my favorite wheel in the other .
i asked all the walks that i probably wouldn &apos;t do with them , the most important ones i would not be able to do , which i would not be able to look at , the friends that i wouldn &apos;t be able to do with them .
because you don &apos;t need the most sophisticated .
and if you &apos;re going to get you back from the back , against the wind , you can just go down and it &apos;s going to make it a little bit of the crap . &quot;
20 years ago , the doctors had cut my leg and hoped , and there was a 15 of the chance of opportunity .
as i was more and more humane -- and at that point in my life , i was probably 14 kilos easier than i am now .
and nobody represents this modern cultural system in my eyes more than david black .
walking upright , you say , is the threshold of what makes us human .
he &apos;s president of the international union for the most of the world &apos;s name , which is the least the most popular name i &apos;ve ever heard .
he was born three months early , and it was really a fantastic fan of him .
so once i tried to get to the piano , i became a strong job of the piano .
and at the end , you were so fast that things like the flight of the flight didn &apos;t have a problem , right ?
do you want to hear me ?
dp : &quot; tiger rag &quot; .
i &apos;m not going to do that .
they &apos;re fighting about their own lifestyle in this forest , in a world that is still clean , a world that &apos;s still not a mess , in a world that &apos;s not been distracted .
so we know that they &apos;re capable of doing that , that they have been able to do the research for absolutely impossible than i started .
the long loving people are supporting the mother who &apos;s developed during this long childhood , and also the siblings , can keep the whole life long , and that can be to 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and also the huge camp of the forest in the forest now needs meat , and so the pygmies that are burning in the congo congo and there are so many hundreds of years in the congo basin , and they &apos;ve lived in
yesterday , somebody said that .
now , we &apos;re in every state , and the problems in florida are other than the ones in new york .
do you get me down and you can turn me down here ?
there &apos;s the politicians out there ?
what we want to do in the lab is so much the same , but with a few dozen of different kinds of molecules -- such a radical reduction of complexity , but yet the trial is to create something more powerful .
it &apos;s actually very , very reactive . if you &apos;re in a way , it doesn &apos;t really do something .
now , where you &apos;re all experts for protocells , we &apos;re going to play with these protocells .
we then see the self-assembly of these bodies from oil spills that we &apos;ve seen before , and the black blobs represent this black mud -- these areas , very complex , organic black mud .
in his lab , martin mandelbrot &apos;s &quot; protocells &quot; made &quot; protocells , &quot; experimental blobs of chemicals that behave like living cells . his work shows how life could come on on earth first ... and maybe elsewhere .
this is a video project to take your tadpole walk on the evening .
what is that -- where did you know ? you &apos;ve taken it .
but if we did that at every fire -- every fire , we could redefine the emergency of emergency .
it &apos;s the rain that &apos;s otherwise going to fix in your pretty pink lungs , and that &apos;s where it &apos;s associated with -- it &apos;s going to be associated with --
the birds could jump from one to another jump .
you can get a current news of him . you can talk to him .
but to keep these herd , a big toll of our planet will demand .
next , we put skin cells and multiply them in a corporate scanner .
we &apos;ve been working with thousands of years of working with products like wine , beer and yogurt .
it &apos;s true that if we &apos;re all on the world , we &apos;re seeing our research , we see that there &apos;s almost a universal pursuit of people after that , a car .
let me just talk about hydrogen .
this is a huge opportunity to create energy , to create energy .
if we can see these kinds of things , that can also be other .
you had to survive .
and we certainly gave ourselves to be our school district to get funding and support .
because why should our students drive away from their lives ?
it became a book , then a demo .
there was an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
here &apos;s the west coast of the west , they destroyed their forest .
but on this picture , you see how we started building the most powerful , which was soon a big , big school of brazil .
when i was the time , my favorite time , i started to start the new field of research , i studied the new field of the field of research .
if you &apos;re in the south of manhattan , you see the expansion of new york city like it was , at the end of the american revolution .
the white surfaces on this map are the most productive places .
or the most delicious , the wet meadows , insects and the places that are needed .
maybe a more lived one , too .
it &apos;s so much power in the way that science and visualization is to unite these images , and it &apos;s like seeing these images of the mirror .
and we have a really dramatic level of magnitude in our society right now .
so i don &apos;t have to go to that .
you can do the pristine thing , of course .
this is a building building .
one example we all know is this one cell phone , right ?
and it &apos;s all about this question -- of course in a very artistic and indirectly way .
but it &apos;s happening everywhere , and these tools are parts of it that help us create it .
seriously -- clap it quiet -- that &apos;s really great .
alex steffen : a sustainable future
you could mean that this could be a big problem for a law , but congress seems to be not very much very concerned about it .
but if you make a lot of your high copies , and you sell it , it &apos;s not okay .
some of the things we share , we made things that we found , and every single option is causing horror in this industry .
that &apos;s the simple thing .
i had a very supportive , expensive , expensive education in india , and that &apos;s almost broken me .
and i thought , i &apos;m going to start a barefoot college -- college only for the poor .
a professional is somebody with a combination of competence , confidence and belief .
when i said that , they said , &quot; show us what &apos;s possible . what do you do ?
the entire power comes from the sun .
democracy , the way you &apos;re going to be missed , what you should be doing , if you &apos;re arrested , what you should do if you &apos;re sick , if you &apos;re sick .
it &apos;s going to be in the presence of tension , it increases the presence of the schools , and it &apos;s going to be between teachers and parents , so the puppets can call the teachers and parents , and say , &quot; give you the hands .
you use sign signs .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , mr. president .
a computer company .
and our main design is creating one of the largest , dynamic , dynamic computers of the world for this kind of thing .
you see the most sophisticated line of the world &apos;s brain that we have as artists for scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , there &apos;s data of these two groups of people , data about how happy they are .
&quot; i &apos;m going to be physically , financially , emotionally , mentally , mentally , mentally , mentally , and in almost every other way . &quot;
he didn &apos;t applaud him , and of course , ray was six months later , the same idea .
in this case , because they &apos;re in the experiment that i &apos;m going to tell you about , i &apos;m going to be using prints from the images of the images .
we collected our materials , and we went out of the room , waiting for half an hour .
i &apos;m going to show you why .
they were more able to get two pictures and they had two beautiful folk giants of them , and we said , &quot; which would you give them ? &quot;
we take a completely new group of naive , and say , &quot; you know , we give a laser and we can do it on two different types .
and the big car , the big car and the most beautiful , is beautiful .
voices : it flies into the air . oh shit .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t start ! &quot;
don &apos;t forget that this tradition is not from the clouds of the clouds , but further back into a time , before we put stories on the street , or even before we were on the wet river , or the wet water .
the way food , yeah .
the kind of thing with the roof roof , you know .
and so we had my father , because i knew he would kill me , if i had to drive them alone , so we go into the car .
&quot; and had this guy a warm uniform , and a little bit of a uniform expression in the face ? &quot;
i really want to go in ? because if i don &apos;t have a thread , i &apos;m not sure enough to get to the point of metaphors -- enough metaphor for your taste ? -- could it be that i never come back again .
look ? we &apos;re a secret club with a secret model .
she says , &quot; ma , you have to look ! &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m looking for the little old lady , &quot; i &apos;m going to be damn damn . &quot;
it &apos;s up from the car . &quot;
i really am afraid .
so what is the social result of this ?
where can i go today and with whom together ?
and if we have it , we will decide how many miles we &apos;re going to go , where we live and work .
smart terminal on the station communicate and you see exactly where your bus is on the front and when he comes , and you can buy your tickets in real time .
i want to say that we &apos;re going to be able to take the wireless internet , and i challenge that this network should be open standards for each other .
and they came in the late 1960s .
and for all of you who came with mental illness in touch , what a challenge can be .
i said that i wanted to tell the most popular , i wanted to share with you the three a &apos;s of fantastic sharing and i wanted to leave it with a happy .
because they were all three years old .
and so what i love about this story is that rosey grier is just a genuine person , and that &apos;s why authenticity is .
i ate the little little . &quot;
you can sleep in clean sheets .
j it &apos;s so many that the problem has become problematic .
i found it weird about making it a competition , as if it was a competition , about a fresh wound .
it &apos;s a little bit of a white , rich , rich , rich , not suggesting for the city .
it looks pretty simple , but it was a very simple thing .
people are going to be amazed by two things -- they were amazed about the destruction , but there was also a sense of the most powerful about the new york , which i found very moving .
because at the point of four platforms , the four platforms along the world -- where one of the more powerful version of a brain &apos;s brain is -- we knew that it had to be mobile , to respond to the conditions and the changed definition of ground
we have the opportunity to rethink our thinking about cities .
dr : it was a privilege .
and i know kids suffer every year .
if -- god forbid -- somebody &apos;s -- somebody from us here , and a concussion , would be the most of us in a period of a few hours to some weeks .
you have to know about the problems that we &apos;re talking about today .
and as it turns out , tom saw a helmet that was a helmet for 20 dollars a good way to preserve a 100,000 percent of a 100,000 .
it &apos;s not true , but it happened tony blair during the davos in 2005 , when his doodles , of course , &quot; discovered &quot; and he was described by this .
in other words , they have a common and growing complexity of visual language that happens in the series of a series of images .
he was told that there was no cure .
today , all countries are committed to offer patents for drugs that were at least 20 years .
it depends on the drug companies of the drug companies , their patents to be able to get them to others and make them available for others .
in orlando , the same way , a second stage , the people sat in the hamptons , the afternoon , in very high humidity , and they didn &apos;t feel like it was .
you can adapt everything to worry about your well-being .
he offers all these services , and it &apos;s giving up tickets , and so little things that you &apos;re doing online , but for people who are so only linked to the digital world .
the question was , &quot; how do you make this teacher ?
let &apos;s see what he does here .
and the husband of the daughter , he was also sick by the exhaustion of his wife .
but the visual complexity is still very large .
well , the first thing that had a computer company had a research program on our studies .
well , if we feel emotions , we show them .
and you could get the impression that the unhappy people are taking a different structural position within the network .
that &apos;s my favorite . &quot;
they &apos;re both made of carbon , and yet one of both of these are in a way that are placed in a particular way , on the left , and they get the soft and dark , and it &apos;s soft and dark .
to put something out of this , let me just pull out a moment .
and then , older is not easy to be .
under the same circumstances , older people are holding their cognitive resources , like the brain , and memory , more on positive information than negative .
we cost life .
they &apos;d like to give me , &quot; tonight , i &apos;m going to perform this kind of thing for this girl on this bar . &quot;
kid david : it &apos;s so that i &apos;m , frankly , not quite , really , not really , what happens when i dance .
they &apos;ve been called me brother and uncles , and i kept invited to get over five years of time .
leah : the second contract of fort laramie stopped the sovereignty of the great sioux nation and the lakota of the lakota black hills .
the treaty of fort laramie was that at least three quarter of the world &apos;s worth of the world would have to sign up to land .
they were tired of the treaties .
the most powerful is eight times as high as the american average .
so what &apos;s going on ?
and today , child mortality dropped from 1960 to six percent of the year today .
you get it either as a pill or a syringe , you have to take it every day to regulate the blood sugar .
if we do it , with people , they have ...
but basically it makes a lot of sense .
is it called , are you smarter than a more powerful ?
bmw is a very safe car .
the problem for bmw is that this car looks safe .
now you &apos;re going to think , &quot; if my life depends on it , i &apos;ll use it every day . &quot;
we need to connect these with a scientific method .
this is something else to do a effective campaign .
what &apos;s new .
the lights are going to be dark .
we do it for our clients .
we have the sun in the sun .
now , logic -- logical , logical , you &apos;re now looking at this position in this position -- without moving the wrist .
i &apos;m going to be able to intervene now . now , every time ... another person -- not always the same answers .
so , if you &apos;re interested in this , i &apos;m going to present some of the most sophisticated .
here -- i have to look at the beginning of looking at my cards as i can follow my cards -- oh , we should have started together -- no problem , no problem .
yeah ?
i think ...
lg : pardon ?
what map is i going to use ? the lady or the five ?
lg : but you see your hand .
wait , wait -- please take any card .
another color . lg : diamonds , perfect .
compassion .
diamonds , yes ? zoe : yeah .
here -- all the cards -- are all the cards -- are all the cards -- is you to me ?
and finally , the king -- in exactly five seconds .
some of you seem to know this child .
after i was back to a company , i was doing my whole company . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have a musical ear , you could not turn a ride in the car .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s really happening here .
i say my students always : &quot; if you have a fallacy , you always see a eyebrow , then everybody recognizes . &quot;
imagine the person and follow the whole way of the b and you &apos;ll hear everything that chopin had to say .
i had an amazing experience . i was 45 , and i had a realization for 20 years , and i had a realization .
she came to auschwitz as she was 15 years old , her brother was eight , her parents lost her .
so , ladies and gentlemen from the jury , look at this .
if you &apos;re the fastest of all today , you get 20 dollars . &quot;
but for tasks of the 21st century , this flock of the world works , not -- often not , often , and often harm .
think of your own work .
the standard standard is lower .
these are the building blocks of a completely new operating system for our business .
this one day intense autonomy has led to a whole range of plastic , which may never have been given .
do it because you like to do it .
the aluminum is used because of its easy weight .
in a series of 55 spheres , they &apos;re declining , interconnected , every sphere and their distances , to shrink them into the small soil .
and the blue side , the most powerful , shows in the other direction .
this has evolved in many of the most sophisticated years .
the most important thing on the object would be a high picture of the earth .
but it &apos;s always going to go back to the 10 percent or more , which is most respected or more .
and the dollar &apos;s dollar and a group of a group of the day .
nonprofit organizations have to be able to get bold , bold , big , new number of rules , to try to make a fear of fear that they &apos;re being pulled through the dirt .
so what should you do ?
the overhead was now coming .
dan strudwick : our mindset about charity is a
then there was the most popular listeners , yes , that &apos;s the way that you have a part of music .
people who made these kinds of things that have been doing the most beautiful instruments , all these beautiful instruments .

now , if you &apos;re going to have a car accident , it &apos;s critical that we don &apos;t just save the stunt , but the crew .
so , for this one , otherwise , they used to be used , and once it was all you had .
but today we use a solar system .
more is not a more powerful one .
in 1960 , joseph had a little bit of air air force , which was something very incredible .
one of the difficulty in this altitude , if you go to 10,000 feet -- that &apos;s great , right ? if you go to 10,000 , you can really use oxygen .
and they designed a puppet for him , just like this , and he looked like this .
we expect and others expect that maybe the lesters or the most of the people are going to say , &quot; you have to put somebody in a suit that &apos;s not filled with the airplane . &quot;
there were three main classes -- right ? -- that &apos;s the conference that &apos;s important to what i want to talk about .

the problem is to stay an artist while you grow up . i &apos;m convinced that we don &apos;t grow in creativity , but we &apos;re going to be in the way that we &apos;re going to be in the creativity .

before i want to return to the middle east , i &apos;d like to close to a quote with a quote of one of the greatest most profound .
it &apos;s also the most important .
well , you &apos;re a lot of behavior , and you &apos;re a behavior of behavior , and you &apos;re a mind of the mind .
we don &apos;t all have facts . we don &apos;t even know what tools are going to be , or what we need to be looking for in the very least to be able to get to the other , before the different behavior shows .
how are you going to scale it up ? &quot;
the three are the same , although they &apos;re all the same in different context , one is magical , the other two are like work , because they have something very special about themselves , because they have something very special about themselves .
the kids taught them .
they were very friendly .
we also believe that the content is more important .
i was changed by my children .
howard makes this experiment and when he gets the data , he &apos;s drawing a curve , and suddenly he recognizes that no beautiful thing is going to make .
this was his somali . he was obsessed with it .
howard doesn &apos;t believe that there are all these things .
and the people always say , if you ask them how they wish their coffee .
mustard with more elegance and culture and meaning .
so , why did it work . why did we like that ?
he was a few times , and he spent most of his career in the lower category , and then he ended up in management . he was the general manager of the oakland &apos;s oakland .
we all know what happened when millions of women were given over decades of symptoms for symptoms of the world &apos;s disease , until we have a huge study , and we found it , from the national government , found , found , found , found , found
thank you .
but dad &apos;s very scary and he didn &apos;t want us to do that .
but there &apos;s also a middle area in between .
these are four really different ways to see the world . i named it .
what &apos;s interesting is once you &apos;re going to get it -- and -- by the way -- that &apos;s from a crater -- all the artifacts of modern comics : the whole artifacts of modern comics : the basic line of the world &apos;s simple line of light
and that was what i proposed : we might be able to do comics on an infinite canvas : on the top of the line and the y-axis and in the y-axis .
this is from daniel &apos;s kitchen &apos;s in britain .
maybe you &apos;ve all been clear for all of this , but for me , so often i &apos;ve been watching this hard day , i had never seen this kind of thing that was going on .
this is honest and real , and the reason , what we have , the new idea of this is a sustainable impression .

they were starting to go back to the brink of dinosaurs , 65 million years ago , when whales had legs , they allow me to get a little bit of a laser , and they &apos;re going to allow me to get this poetic of the twin .
and how do you do that ?
the california &apos;s ocean takes the molas when they come into the bay , they &apos;re going to break them up , they turn them into a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of brain , and then they
i &apos;ll show you our last data data .
and in the most exciting part , all of their love and their interest for the oceans are common .
so , as you can see here , this is a circuit board .

so , ha ha .
in australia , it &apos;s mostly the aboriginal aboriginal people sitting in jail .
she told him , and he asked the first ted community to what we call the most popular .

goodbye mahatma gandhi .
could i get my last track ?
never , that &apos;s impossible ! no , no , no ! that &apos;s not possible . &quot;
you could handle the whole thing with the addition .
von neumann , a computer scientist and a mathematician of the army brought everything together , and then they needed a room to build them .
and the one that worked on first is by the first time .
&quot; aha ! &quot; finally , they found that it was a very reactive .
i know if i got to get beaten . &quot;
he had the machine running all night , if someone remembered stephen wolfram , who invented the whole thing .
now we &apos;re going to sit here 50 years later -- it &apos;s a kind of power of animation .
sadly , in the next 18 minutes i &apos;m talking about here , four americans who are still alive , die of their diet .
this is a global problem .
it &apos;s the city .
and he &apos;s got the appeal of it . he &apos;s tired of having his friends , his family and his community .
they want ... they want to control themselves .
you know , for long , long time at this tight understanding of this very narrow understanding .
we don &apos;t teach our kids .
and most of the kids get them .
well , supermarkets .
if you can cook , time doesn &apos;t matter .
in all america , many wonderful things go to the face of the day when we just look back .
misha glenny : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen -- a clever group of political hackers who brought in 2011 .
the net connects everything and will be very soon a lot of human activity .
interestingly , anonymous uses its own information , but not for financial profits .
he explained to me how he went in 2003 and 2004 , and he went to new york , and he took 10,000 dollars from the atm machines here , 30,000 dollars from the atm machines .
he was born in a stable and respect family family , and he was born with play as a teenager , and he was born with a juvenile family .
and most of the script , and most of the script , didn &apos;t reveal real social skills in the outside world -- only in the net .
i think there &apos;s several reasons . i &apos;m not going to go into the details , but some mention .
but they &apos;re all determined by the market , and what &apos;s driving the market is mostly -- number one is the big demographic of the demographic .
we &apos;ve also found a lot of examples of dead big boxes that have been transformed in all kinds of social institutions , many schools , many churches , many churches , and many libraries , like this one .
and finally , i expect the streets to be extended through the mall .
it &apos;s very successful . and it helped inspire that eight of 13 local vehicles have been in denver plans to become a , to become more powerful .
the stream was covered by the parking lot .
their citizens are different than typical of the typical , but they &apos;re less than cities .
&quot; his vagina to look at , &quot; she said , &quot; is a whole of a whole computer . &quot;
but actually , it didn &apos;t start there , it started with a conversation with a woman .
it &apos;s about a gender that is a fundamental resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a key , and the way that it really exists in the body , and i think there &apos;s a real meaning in our bodies , our bodies , that have created a division of disorder , that has been made that separation of the decision .
i want to tell you this little story about my own beginnings , because it &apos;s very strong with happiness , and with agnes .
maybe it &apos;s on my favorite south carolina , which is not much smaller than today &apos;s hungary , and once of a future as an independent country .
well , maybe he was too damn , because he stayed where he was , long after the nazis , and even after the most popular and the most cosmopolitan and the most cosmopolitan and the most cosmopolitan and the most cosmopolitan in budapest .
and he got the same answer : &quot; bring me the best workers you can find and if you &apos;re good enough , i &apos;ll give you a . &quot;
and it &apos;s also clear , &quot; it &apos;s okay . it was all so beautiful .
&quot; aha ! &quot; said dr. robicsek . &quot; i went to the movie alone . &quot;
like i said , he &apos;s too much .
and you can imagine it right .
you know what you &apos;re looking for .
but we &apos;re taking care of the most difficult cases and order to get the other day back .
so we came to these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother went to the soviet union while the soviet union .
and if you think it &apos;s not going to go , it &apos;s going to push so long until you go on .
what i want to try to do with this -- i hope to show you the following dots .
and what i want to point out later in the presentation , 50 percent of the u.s. is under the ocean .
it &apos;s there , because photons can &apos;t reach the average depth of the ocean , which is the main valley , the rift valley is on the top of the ocean .
and so we drove along the mountain ridge in a field next to the bottom of the mountain , and found the missing heat .
so i started to develop a new computer program , with a computer company that replaced me , and i don &apos;t have to go up in my car .
we find the state of conservation .
and i looked at them yesterday , she &apos;s up in seattle . ok .
but i would leave a child without a driver &apos;s control system .
in some parts of the world , for example , in south africa , education is hard to be accessible .
when we saw the effect of the help , andrew and i decided that we had to increase it to the best of the people as possible as possible .
what was the special thing about these courses ?
the video is interrupted all the few minutes and the students will ask a question .
so we wanted to convince some of our colleagues of the humanities that multiple choice is not so bad .
in terms of certain courses , you can ask the most of the believers , and how to help the students to fix these .
we even see the beginning of either through a personalized curriculum or through a personalized curriculum that we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe , and what my first thought was , what infinity means when i was a kid .
and in our society , of course , it &apos;s mainly about being able to make the reality of others .
i have my doubt about the values of newton &apos;s science , like , for example , it &apos;s expected to be rational in a corporate rational .
so you can understand my surprise when i got to read in the new yorker , that alan greenspan , the head of the federal reserve , said , &quot; illinois rand , &quot; his mentor mentor .
i think you can do it about the funny , which is not about the ones who don &apos;t have . right from this reason , i don &apos;t have a jokes about 80,000 , and his charming , and his charming .
i &apos;m going to get this old times of the most old time of the design , i &apos;m going to tell you .
he said , i &apos;d have to pay him more respect because it can take to 18 years to get a really good job of happiness .
huh ? yes ? what ? i can &apos;t hear it . &quot;
and i &apos;m afraid that this active person doesn &apos;t like us .
i &apos;ve thought about moshe &apos;s thoughts about beauty that she &apos;s going to tell us yesterday , because in his book , that &apos;s what the trickster says sometimes can make beauty .
george w. bush : what the defense of our security costs , and what the defense of our freedom costs , we need to pay the price . &quot;
ten years ago , no astronomer would have been on the world -- well , or very few astronomers -- that there are planets outside of our solar system .
many other ecosystems on earth are truly in danger .
he &apos;s constantly making it that an experiment with a particle accelerator could go wrong and create a chain that &apos;s destroyed the world .
we need to let the same kind of deal with biotechnology as we have in the same way .
so , of course , we don &apos;t want to see .
what can we do about this ?
and now the worst thing comes .
we use a lot of money on it , making sure that we don &apos;t die at a time of dying , but we &apos;re almost not going to be completely preventable , and yet it &apos;s completely preventable .
we don &apos;t want to get caught on the wrong foot .
i hope that &apos;s going to be .
this is very , very important , because this is the system that came out of the life , and it &apos;s now time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing insight . and we &apos;ve only been aware of it since recently .
and this is what the system is sending , a number of places in the southern hemisphere , shown in these circles .
everybody who comes up to this is just taking the database and can just use information to the database that &apos;s needed for everything .
we &apos;re on to ride the wave , the technological possibilities .
in a earthquake , big amounts of these new microbes that we never saw before , from the sea floor .
the most beautiful john hunter creates a network of the sun &apos;s cameras and sensors that make our oceans to global , interactive lab -- and a key thing about the world of deep causes .
so i think optimism is going to move forward .
so again , radical versus conservative .
the most obvious thing about the most obvious thing . you know , too often you want to understand everything .
our intellectual desires are complex .
you know that it &apos;s true ; the cathedrals , as unexpected , will always be unexpected .
but i rather play something completely unknown , and even with mistakes , rather than repeat the same thing , so it &apos;s from its insignificance .
risks of rooms never have been so much like they should be in a groundbreaking city .
there &apos;s the emotions of victims .
daniel libeskind builds up very large ideas , and he calls 17 terms of the vision of architecture to basically be -- raw , enlightened , more radical , radical -- and inspiration for every bold creative pursuit .
it also has the lowest most of all the cars of the size .
so , what really does it do is , or will it just give you a few more of the time ?
em : it &apos;s just got to be . if not , we &apos;re in big trouble .
with this capital , and then he buys the panels on the roof and then it &apos;s going to calculate the panels on the roof , and then they &apos;re going to get a monthly meter , which is lower than the nuclear bill .
we &apos;ve failed , but we &apos;ve gone in 2008 .
it &apos;s similar to a jet jet .
how about all the world in the world , one person is literally innovative ?
look at this .
boy , if you &apos;re eating our livestock , and a cheetahs like it eats one of our goats , it &apos;s very nervous . then just go to him .
we suffered hunger .
our tradition looks like this : in every single business , there &apos;s a holy fire .
so , until now , we were able to support the world wildlife fund in the world that &apos;s very small programs to make more programs with the world &apos;s disease .
also , very important -- we invest the money in enlightenment and hiv .
and so , again , again , a lot of the world &apos;s time in the world of the world &apos;s population -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful tool .
and we &apos;re hiding this price behind huge winning .
dan forbid and alice gibson &apos;s passionate revolution for environmental food .
and the currents , shells , oysters , the oysters , the , the most famous , the most famous species -- these were the known species .
this is like a nozzle from protein .
science looks the world through the mind , and the way that you can see things that are measured and described , but they have the art of knowledge and knowledge .
from a few cameras , a plan of three cameras became a plan with 25 of the stars .
this is the natural cycle .
that would not usually do a photographer , a photograph that &apos;s like to be able to do it , right ? but sometimes it has to be to show the dimensions .
here you see the glacier moving back .
this is a couple of cameras .
could india be the origin or a global center for innovation , just like it &apos;s become a global center for the world &apos;s center and the world &apos;s disease ?
when we asked people in conversation with people in these twin classes , they said , &quot; we &apos;re working on global products . &quot;
you can &apos;t be a professor if you weren &apos;t a student .
the best hospitals , in the doctors , would go to cancer treatments , and at births , the heart disease , heart disease , heart disease , for artificial design , to be four o &apos;clock in the morning .
it works a little bit like -- this is a recently , a recent period of time for four in the morning .
i said , i know a very keen message when i see a look .
everyone in our society comes with cancer in touch -- if not personal , then by a beloved people , a member of a family member , a friend , a friend .
in this space space , the genetic material , the chromosomes , within a nucleus .
we &apos;ve applied tumor fields in the lab over 20 different cancers , and we see this effect in all of them .
he got the most popular .
but what we can see is that in sixth month of the tumor , it &apos;s going to be responding to the tumor .
that &apos;s just the beginning .
this is a new cubicle , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re 15 feet deep , and they collect rainwater from the roof , there &apos;s a little pipe , and from their courtyard .
so , water from 300 , 400 miles away , it looks like this .
somewhere , a stream or a laser stream through this scene .
this is called &quot; metastases . &quot; in english , we have a lot of water and water .
and you have to go further .
these are the beautiful stairs we &apos;ve just seen on one of the images .
and the more powerful is down 27 percent : 600,000 fewer people per year , hiv in sub-saharan africa .
10 percent of india .
they &apos;re going to get the jobs in textiles , which people get out of the world &apos;s surface and bring them to the distance of the way to the industrialization and prosperity .
and the countries on the right , you see the most important thing , and basically , every country has a little bit of a time , say , less than 5,000 dollars , a more powerful one of saying , we &apos;re three .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india grew up not so right .
buy african products .
but i think a lot of the problem is that this logic -- that we should be able to drop ipods and not bombs -- i mean , it would be a great title for thomas chaplin &apos;s new book .
so , 500 people have been picked up and four of them were chosen to visit the institution and so they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to do it .
so now citizens with a global deal in planning to 2020 is not necessarily something that is going to change , because it still is the dictators , which control the agenda .
so , the internet &apos;s favorite is the internet &apos;s worst expectations ?
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he was on the younger fellows with us .
because for me , that time in this time , and in this particular period , the question was , &quot; you want to ? &quot; you want to be ? &quot;
i was paralyzed , people .
as indians , and now politicians and the most powerful , i &apos;m pretty much about the most sophisticated , which is our country , concerned , all the talk about india as a new superpower , even the new superpower .
in other words , all sorts of things tell us about countries , regardless of whether they want to come to the daylight or not .
but the lightning in our country at the time was pretty slow , took it to a half an hour , and it took a call to a call .
it can &apos;t understand the conversation .
this can sometimes have an unwanted consequences . ok .
and these of you who have their money , you might be surprised to see how many of the people who are there are in the front of the world , which is the most important thing to explain .
i went home and i was doing a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of scary statistics .
so , the big one is a bath without water .
and now i feel like george bush .
now , this title , this expression , comes from a critic , a early critic and this is a passage that i just love , and i would like to read them .
and that &apos;s a good thing , because if it would be , mom nature would have a problem : how about all the world we get to mate ?
this is the hardest part , which is not obvious . and so i &apos;ve got it for the end .
ok ? stop . that &apos;s going to be going .
i don &apos;t know why there are a lot of the time , but no matter what they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you . thank you .
i actually suspect that the most likely you know , the most important reason we want to do new things , why we want to engage new things very , very quickly .
it &apos;s like this . you should see that like this .
bob mckim has a different very -- another version of this exercise in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned that with time : you get a much better logos , much more creative results , if all of you are holding the rules .
and suddenly , there was a productive conversation about design about a real object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little bit skeptical , i &apos;ll come back to it .
you know how it feels like all of these uncertainty , as long as you leave back in the corridor , as the doctors are going to take care of a single case , and you ask yourself what &apos;s going on here .
so we would all feel secure and have a good time because we agree about the rules and that would be agreed .
we do everything that leads to success , but then if we &apos;re there , we think we &apos;ve done it . we &apos;re satisfied to be happy and just stop doing all that , and we &apos;re just going to do that , all of us .
i was faster , but as depressed as it was .
i learned that success is not a one-way street .
and the most easy thing is just full of hot girls . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh my god , &quot; hopefully , for always , the last time in public .
he certainly made sure that everything fit together .
it took 900 people to do it .
and the second is that people obviously experience a real connection .
these are questions .
as you see in modern liberal democracies , society is not just allowed us to determine our own selves , our self , but it also demands it from us .
it means we &apos;re going to fulfill our full potential as human beings .
so these are the layers that are the kinds of questions that i wanted to run them today -- the question : what are the intentions that come to use when they design something ?
so i said , and my colleague sebastian thrun said that there must be better ways .
and we were successful .
i &apos;m going to give one in the fall .
he &apos;s going to be in the right position , and it &apos;s going to be with his nose and beat it .
we learned the first surprise .
it had to give any kind of a kind of a kind of a design to see the amount of power and the speed that we observe and the speed of the system .
a load cell measures forces and that &apos;s actually a cell load load cell with a crystal inside .
this is the most popular -- here &apos;s the heel , and that &apos;s going to go around and meet the load cell .
a very , very , very , very , very , very simple solution for the special problem .
and manuscripts : it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean .
i think that &apos;s one of the most beautiful classical scientists ever built .
i don &apos;t know any other marketing , not even more , not even the benefit of that that is a three-dimensional space .
now you see that -- he just makes me stand .
the submarine , the last year , was this one .
and the idea of architecture is as a function of architecture , and , you know , please , please apologize , is the obvious example -- is not the right approach we have to choose .
basically , new york was built on the back of the mountain of the mountain , our streets over their shells .
in these eight side chambers , small bits of chambers are put in the same way that they &apos;re going to be in .
so you went around in london , and it was overwhelmed by this smell .
finally , snow created a map of the outbreak .
and that &apos;s what happens every second week .
i made her portrait on the top of the temple .
and in this area of the amazon , in the 1930s , the oil was discovered .
the other side of the field is torah , where actually osama bin laden is supposed to be a store . that &apos;s a little bit of the time .
this was one of the great things .
this is the most popular . let me move and show you the hubble field of deep field .
but then you get to jupiter and the one is 40 minutes away . that &apos;s a problem .
this is going to be part of the beginning of the universe that &apos;s going to be about the beginning of the universe .
we just have a million galaxies .
so the stuff that seems to be white is the dark matter .
when you saw this picture , you don &apos;t have a lot of it to see .
this simulation was done for 1,000 processors a month , just to just make this visible .
with a little bit of hope , we hope to have a resolution that is about this image of the earth , which is actually the complicated patterns of the earth .
and in the episode , we &apos;re stressed .
47 percent .
this is crazy . we &apos;re doing it all the time , even in the day-to-day life .
i got into a vicious cycle . that led to many pain and problems with the joints so i could almost nothing .
so i asked myself , could you be creative if you look for intent ?
this is not happening from today .
the constant is responsible by the very least , as a result of a brain &apos;s brain , and there &apos;s a lot of the time of environmental degradation and mysterious monitoring of environmental degradation .
stalin &apos;s famine famine &apos;s &apos; 30s , the most prolific , killed millions of dollars , and in the &apos; 40s , they saw the nazis , the most infected , burning , were beaten up , and many of the women were trafficked at the time of
because that &apos;s what makes the grief around . &quot;
and as a psychologist , i was excited about most of the idea that we had learned what we had learned in virtual world about us , and we could use our identity , to live a better life in the real world .
we used to be used to a new way of being together alone .
human relationships are inappropriate , chaotic and recyclable .
it &apos;s the way they do .
because in the moment , in the people alone , even for a few seconds , they will be more appreciative , scared , they get to reach , they get to a electronic device .
but we &apos;re in danger because in fact , the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently , we didn &apos;t have won any of the most sophisticated , which some of our students had predicted , and quite often -- quite often , i felt that they had a kind of influence on financial form .
maybe because my father &apos;s reading the day .
so i had them in quiet -- but it was pretty good and it was really friendly .
and finally , i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to take a pyramid , but i &apos;m missing the time to take a closer look at it .
although you lose , not fear of failure , if we &apos;ve given all of the time , because who can be more demanding , because who can be more willing to give it to what he &apos;s doing .
if i call it names , i never know about it .
did i have enough food ?
the second challenge would be cells .
today , in many clinical trials , different kinds of stem cells are used for heart disease .
and only last month , it &apos;s been done with this technology that &apos;s made to show human health systems .
we can map them and turn to 360 degrees and analyze the kidney in all their grim properties , and then we can just take this information and print it by a little bit of the time .
i couldn &apos;t regularly go to school . i just went dirty .
i was a kid , i said , &quot; yes , i want to do this . i want this surgery .
you may have noticed that a new area is called the coalition .
and connected to this kind of thing , there was examples of the world -- from the choice of a president to the most of the president , and everything between the middle of the day -- that showed the power of a lot of the power .
third , more energetic , progressive environmental issues .
because what you need is that the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want a cd , i want the music to play .
i name joseph and i &apos;m a member of kenya in kenya .
we need to have our women and children , we need to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve the infrastructure .
i went home at night with batteries and ice .
together , did anybody have a little bit of notes ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , the master &apos;s master and working in a full-time way to do this .
and that can be huge spending , but if the city can win a number of x volunteers for y hours , the most important thing is the most important thing to do to the city of the city .
they have a lot of the data , tables and data .
so , these are , in the 18 minutes , that i &apos;ve been able to talk to you about here , between two and a half people who are going to be in cities .
and he was in a prison cabin in a mud mud .
the buildings here have several stories .
these green things in the foreground are mangoes .
and if you &apos;re a legal fuel system , you have political activity .
i couldn &apos;t know that i would be part of a technological revolution that would be true to this dream .
think about it . these men who didn &apos;t have the same as i helped me to get their engaged support , to get more , more competent in law .
and then , in the back of the time , the only thing that was working on was a very simple , but by using a laser company , and he used a machine , and he could develop a machine that could read every single one of the
but you know , i think it &apos;s very lonely to read me from machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books over the border , in the different english countries , different versions of the u.k. , the u.k. , united states , canada , canada , australia , and new zealand , and new zealand had all sorts of different
the most powerful . lifespan has been doubled since of the time of the time , and it &apos;s increasing with a speed of five hours a day .
one last thing . you want to do people like me , okay ?
secondly , the new machine machine is a good news , because once the androids take work , we don &apos;t need to do that anymore and we have to get more educated and more educated .
the social challenges because of these inequality should be addressed .
the economic game is surprising , and surprisingly straightforward , especially in the short view .
and my biggest concern is that we create a world with a world technology , embedded in a slightly more sophisticated society , and supported by a economy that is more profitable than that .
in the course of the years , i started feeling more and more of the idea of god .
some have a few people who have only been able to believe that we can only believe in a god .
in the second phase of the line , the wind and waves obey him .
so who is god , if not the big bang or the internet ?
the loving soul of the universe .
by looking for the god in the inside . by making my own inwardness .
one of the first things i started studying was the story of the design project .
we &apos;ve never found a lot of time that was older than 40 years , and the average age of this predator and collectors is 20 to 30 .
our bodies have used to be used to this new diet .
so this equality of energy and matter , which einstein showed , and also the modern science of the world &apos;s population shows that entropy and information and energy and energy and energy all connect together , so it &apos;s a long continuum .
this is a robot that wants to stick its own plug to get more power .
and what i mean to do with that is that we &apos;re looking for a new job .
a great development that has started billions of years ago , moving through us and continues to be on the technology , and our choice is really in technology , is really in the process of the power that is much more powerful than we are .
and they said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got five classes to 40 students .
we did all this down , and we found beautiful , beautiful bars , and it had the look -- while we &apos;ve been told , somebody said , &quot; you know what the hull of a ship looks like . &quot;
so we waited , we sat on the tables and we waited .
there are many more sophisticated things . the only problem , especially for the adults who were working on mathare , who didn &apos;t really know that they were just a toilet .
the teachers we work with -- everything is different for teachers -- they tell us what we should do .
about 170 tutors , with them , worked with them , and so it worked beautifully .
and right behind -- there &apos;s usually a little chain -- just looking at the kids , and they were taught to be taught .
there &apos;s also these miniature cells -- it &apos;s a shelf that you don &apos;t see when you &apos;re in the blink of the way , but it &apos;s opening up .
he &apos;s a little bit of a sudden . he &apos;s bringing his cousin .
he &apos;s writing an email , he will ask you every question you can imagine .
i was this girl .
80 percent of refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s one side that thinks that peace means the end of the struggle , and there &apos;s a side that thinks that peace is the creation of schools and jobs .
she sent her kids to school -- found a new home .
there &apos;s one , which is the manual for full idiots , did you know that ?
on cape zero , there &apos;s a street street , and we can drive all of this .
that &apos;s my baby . thank you very much .
he basically said , &quot; i &apos;ve designed everything . &quot;
and in a certain sense , i felt bad about that .
so i came up with this kind of complications .
i found out that cheetos are very good at the same time .
the university is the most difficult , so number 10 .
from all in a strange , strange , a strange piece of time , which is a window of a window , which is to be a window of my house , which was black , and that white white , white , was in the sun .
and i was reminded by the great presentation of karen armstrong , that religion really understood nothing with belief , but to do with behavior .
the most sophisticated , geographically , has seen the same size , it doesn &apos;t look like this , but it &apos;s exactly the same size as the united states , and it &apos;s a field of the same size of the state of arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the developed world .
we can &apos;t wait to wait for the most sophisticated , australia , to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of our whole civilization .
a new appreciation of the design that we have through the assumption of this challenge .
before i show you a few pictures to the preview , i want to point out on this beautiful detail about the design of design and design .
rca is really an extraordinary school in this respect .
we &apos;ve been discussing this morning with keith &apos;s , that many scientists don &apos;t tend to show something beautiful in their talks , from fear , as a dumb , as a stupid tool .
here &apos;s examples of that , you can print textiles in 3d , which is very interesting .
so that makes us think more about what robots mean for us .
no . so i had to think a little bit about a little sharper .
we did the same for iraq .
that was a challenge we had to ask as a physicist .
we can push it up . the forces are more than more . there are more of them , but they &apos;re weaker .
&quot; naturally seven &quot; a whole band of &quot;
and there are some employees in foundations that call this &quot; the &quot; s &quot; .
the idea of justice , which shows our lives , and gives us a sense of what is right in life , what &apos;s just in life , what we should do , social justice .
and as it is , he &apos;s a little bit of the time in the prison industry .
so every week , the most popular thing would come to the table . &quot; god , you &apos;ve answered me again . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , an infection , an infection or a surgery .
the muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- called the ones like this .
we treat them with the drugs -- the -- the ones that are open , frankly , in this kind of pain , not very effective .
now you get a sense of this , as much as a rock we &apos;re talking about here .
it was 1908 . it &apos;s not . so i can live .
i don &apos;t know if you can see it from the back line of all the back . these are stars .
in 2005 , nasa started a probe called deep impact , which one -- the deep impact of a comet in the core of a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , like i said , engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a design system and we can choose to change our future .
and i &apos;ve led to this time , the only independent , to be exactly the only electronic medium of the country .
and i thought that the most powerful business was going to survive and a great company would be when the last one was gone , which was really true .
and at the end of the meeting , he says , look , it &apos;s not going to work , you &apos;ll never see your money again , but my foundation will put 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test the idea .
and we said , this is okay , we &apos;re going to make your business plan , which you actually did .
see , we started in latin and central europe with our work and went to russia .
after a while , we opened a computer test .
and we &apos;ve developed the idea , giving bonds to the free press .
and in this way , you &apos;re organized the funding , so that there &apos;s no more blind , no blind , that running around .
so why does it work ? that &apos;s the question .
now , some call this a theory of everything .
just an example is this : newton found the law of gravity , which works like a divided by the square of the mountain of the world between each other .
the more symmetry you have , the better you think of the simplicity and elegance of the theory .
one thing he thought about is most of us today , but it was not for the time of that .
it doesn &apos;t matter the importance of knowing that they &apos;re going to follow the laws of law , and accidents .
but he was reading in every free moment he had , books .
by this ambition , he went back to the prison .
but when he was just in the process of putting his signature under the front of the world , his hand was deaf , and he was shaking because he had a thousand hands during a prison party .
not very surprising -- it was only three women under the white house in the white house .
but i have to say , the older i became , the more i understand what an incredible privilege was , with this aging lion of a man that many hours have spent a lot of hours .
and so like lincoln , the story was told , all after the war , after the u.k.
i asked my father under tears , &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
what the reason is that i &apos;m always grateful for this strange love to the story that allows me to spend a life in the back of the past .
he had the temple and he had a temple .
this is the most important thing that &apos;s the evidence that the jews are in babylon , after the whole years of exile , after all the years they were sitting in babylon , and to be crying at jerusalem , that these jews were going home .
all of these are respected by cyrus .
the cylinder cylinder is from the priests of the great bang of babylon , marduk , written .
they all know what happened .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of people came living in iran , in the living jews .
some of you know more about the living conditions , but you think they &apos;re a kind of a reasonable evil .
the new york babies cried in the first few hours , but their needs were not satisfied and eventually they learned to be able to do it , and they were not going to be able to get them to be a dent in less days , and they
a study shows that support support 10 percent of a population cost , as a result of 30 percent costs .
and that fascinated me , because i had almost spent my whole life a camera .
you know , you know , you &apos;re right to do what you have to do to find an answer .
it was a percentage of people there -- most of them and family .
we heard every single one .
but of course he never came . the explanation has never occurred .
and after many , many meetings i was thrilled that this man , frederick , really one of my heroes and mentors , did it , and it was made , unicef in the boat .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones who believed in peace and their possibilities , etc . , etc . -- and they were actually going to be .
we connect with the food system -- i met a little bit of the time , and i said , &quot; in london 2012 , it &apos;s about truce .
it &apos;s about their own business , to their business .
the biggest brains of the world should also be cognitively most cognitively .
i went to the literature of this number , but i could never find them .
there &apos;s just a big primate brain .
and amazingly , that &apos;s exactly what our ancestors have invented 1.5 million years ago when they discovered cooking .
quite simple approaches for the most powerful conversations i did .
and i think i &apos;m just at the beginning .
but once the fight is the fight , the physical rehabilitation was exposed to .
behind him , a child , his son , red in the face of effort , his father .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
at the evening i spoke with my boss in the headquarters and i told them -- i &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; look , we &apos;re starting to start with a few hours a day , just for some of the deals . &quot;
two groups of the world &apos;s population started fighting .
so i asked him , &quot; what is it ? &quot;
&quot; yes , we need to increase the production of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
it &apos;s not just in the orthopedic center , but it &apos;s also in the houses of people .
and you should see me during a computer shop .
and this hospital could have been able to afford to do it .
why ? because the way i had taken that was banned .
but i learned something more about that than that , which is that the leaders -- the managers of the economy -- the great bad decisions that we had made of the economy of the war .
because i knew that the state of the african continent was important for my children and their children .
i &apos;m trying to get the experience that i had in swarthmore , to africa .
is my time taken ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment from which a great society can rise within a generation .
you &apos;ll notice that he &apos;s going to be very similar to the most yellow ball , the sun we draw as children .
in fact , that &apos;s something that half of you , more than half , will not be familiar .
32 pills &apos; shells .
i think it &apos;s a lot of time . &quot;
and that &apos;s the messages that they communicate ?
because , in the bottom , the sponsors , they love it , and so he &apos;s going to get them all the time on tv .
a professional professional , who talks to dead , didn &apos;t it ?
what is homeopathy ?
we &apos;d like to have a stress of people , like you were , and the way you were willing to put it , and to community authorities , so they do something .
thank you .
so the entire hospital is often going on over a generator .
it has to give something better . &quot;
but the user can control whether there &apos;s electricity or not , because you can control the most powerful on the ground , how much percent oxygen you give your patient .
but we want to be sure that this is the most effective and worse device that we can provide hospitals to .
the different species of writing in africa , the first one was the first time the script of the book , which is the kind of secret of a secret society in the world &apos;s brain .
anyway , until 1998 , when a computer named john coleman discovered in the prison department in the prison department in the coastal valley , in the 1930s , in 1800 , the centuries of the city were found in 1800 .
almost one fifth of all greenhouse gases comes from livestock -- that &apos;s more than the traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and the private animals , and animals at the line of the line , is not just the way that they do tools , is not just okay .
and it was a french issue .
a picture of fish would be better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t quite bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
some of us would be that maybe it wouldn &apos;t be so bad .
about a year ago , i asked myself , &quot; why am i , though i know what i know , no vegetarian ? &quot;
on the weekend , you have the choice .
you can make a picture with an iphone and all the names get , even though it &apos;s still making mistakes .
they &apos;re going to be distracted . he &apos;s going to win the race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would be able to figure out , it &apos;s about interest , more about that , if the stakes are so high , but it &apos;s a very , very valid area .
or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a big piece of artwork .
human nature has to change .
but part of the reason -- and that &apos;s why we have a ethical level in the pursuit of what we have -- is that they &apos;re also intrinsic .
it could be more complicated in humans , but maybe not very .
jh : is it liberating to play with these forces ?
and so i knew that i need something to control .
so there &apos;s a lot of time , because there &apos;s a little bit of the dynamic , because it &apos;s the dynamic behavior of liquid .
and so i think that you can be a little bit of the time .
this is a great assistant in the studio .
we take the pizza , our first pizza , and we break the individual slices , while the messenger is in the hallway and we &apos;re going to be tuned .
i was sure 20 before i first went to art art .
i thought , okay , you &apos;ve got some criteria like you want to choose the works .
it &apos;s not photoshop .
they &apos;re interested in creating a novel alternative , alternative , alternative , and they needed money to make some interesting fundraising projects .
this project is called &quot; the &quot; s . &quot;
and so we went to the grave and we did this , it was hilarious -- the attention we got .
and she describes how the most important thing -- everything you say is like the most of the time of the fruit .
he &apos;s a computer &apos;s military , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it &apos;s with origami . so go .
people used mathematical principles to understand the underlying principles of the underlying rules .
or they &apos;re pushing it on the top and they do 50 stars on a flag with 13 stripes .
how would you make a single flap ?
we &apos;ve found these rules that you put in circles , you put it in the air , and you put the lines of lines that obey the extra rules . that makes the crease pattern .
you can do a lot of things .
but if you want to make it bigger , you could need some origami .
and that doesn &apos;t work whether you go into space or whether you go into a body .
i grew up in a state of washington in the state of washington with too much time .
we only have three minutes . but we &apos;re talking about it for hours .
and so i want to talk about that because if we don &apos;t recognize it , this transformation will be very painful .
and in a moment , i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;re going to see in the graph -- it starts in 1973 , just before the women start to cut the market market , and it goes on to the day .
you were there .
because i write about all this book , i still have to do it , and i don &apos;t have any answer .
and that was very daunting for them .
since we haven &apos;t completely processed this information , they come back to us in the form of culture , in this strange and more unequal way where you can see that the stereotypes can change .
there &apos;s no man or no woman who is in the middle , and it &apos;s the wires to get the wires .
and the personal income on a scale that has been kept to account the constant , to take inflation in this time , is almost tripled .
and to hear me and understand what i say , you need about 60 bits per second .
it &apos;s still happening , so in the last book of me called &quot; good business , &quot; i interviewed some ceo that &apos;s been very successful from her environment as very successful and very ethical , with great social sense .
control is also a safe thing , because you feel in your mind , but not very much .
&quot; where are you born , grew up and went to school ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they had their own meaning for what home is , they had their significance for community , and even for hostility , which was made of birth . they didn &apos;t really have the opportunity to go beyond .
more and more people are also embedded in the future or present , as in the past .
i went down into the room i should sleep in .
so , the question of the question is , where is it home ?
there was a big gap between one billion in the industrialized countries and the two billion in the developing world .
but that &apos;s the world we have today . no gap .
and let me show you why , by the way , by the paintbrush , digital technology .
the kids are the new green .
and again , they were better than we said , &quot; you british and your mortality rate in heart disease . &quot;
but if you have people , you don &apos;t change the high number of heart disease .
and i started working with a working thing , and i started working , and then i worked with a little bit of work -- mice that couldn &apos;t produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my mother-in-law , and of course i don &apos;t know how old she is .
you could be in the summer as well as the equator .
certainly many advances , many of the lives of life .
this is actually real photography , in time , showing that the limb is going to ruin the limb within less days .
and here you see , on the right , what six months later is going to be , technically , appropriate , appropriate .
a blood vessel is made of two different types of cell cell .
we then put it back into this oven-like device .
much more complex organs . with the most complex solid organs , the most complex solid organs are the high , with every amount of blood organs , liver and kidneys .
this is still in the most mature .
we prefer cells that are not going to be repeated and not to make tumors .
we just need five seconds .
for every problem out there , anybody would have an idea .
so i &apos;m right now in panic -- unlike all the marine and sugar , i had -- but this is really an entrepreneur , really , really scary .
that doesn &apos;t mean you have to visit a car .
i went from door to door and sold license plate .
it &apos;s like a recession . so , there &apos;s a recession .
and you would make these chairs .
this is pointless . &quot; you have to get a way to get faster to money .
i sold a lot of evangelical pajamas .
they don &apos;t get regular income , but they have the possibility to find other tasks and they learn to learn the ability to find the ability to find more possibilities .
if you go to a restaurant and you &apos;re going to be doing bad , you &apos;ll show you how bad credit is .
these young , disappointments .
the development of today &apos;s students is , all the interests except to throw out the one on the board .
the most important thing about the computer &apos;s or a computer company on cultural media care is pulling up most of our students .
the values of the past are also called , and that &apos;s bringing a lot of society .
but it &apos;s a politics of principles , not the most important .
they have a mind . and they have other people .
what we should be concerned about when we think about conservatives -- except this case of the 1980s -- what &apos;s going on is , you go to church .
yeah , i know you don &apos;t really believe me .
and that doesn &apos;t just lead to another outcome , it has the potential to change how we deal with each other .
completely different .
actually , this is not a rights organization , but clearly -- let me finish this -- creative commons offers authors a simple way to give their content to the freedoms that they want to leave them .
john mccain .
and i wonder how often this happened .
he told me that he was the most popular and then said , &quot; there &apos;s a snake in the next room , and we &apos;re going to be there now . &quot;
so , for today , i had the idea that i &apos;m going to run them through this process and show them how this journey looks .
and the hospital and general electric were also happy .
i was surviving , just to understand ourselves .
i &apos;m going to ask all of you , &quot; is it really possible to use these microbial ecosystems to our advantage ? &quot;
another way of how microbes can spread through the people is by the people , architects like , like , like , in the same way , to promote the human interaction , or exchange of ideas in the world , and to promote the ideas of ideas in
imagine a design that takes microbes to take place , for example , in the airplane or on a phone .
and nobody knew about it .
my company , the design system , built a system called ownership for the apple macintosh .
in 1992 , his essay was rejected by the most violent .
and greenpeace wanted to do this , and a method that you wanted to do was to get one of these humpback whales in the world .
in 78 percent of the voices . to give you a sense of the victory victory : two in the most violent victory , just three percent .
and the last message i want to tell you is : you can be pretty successful online .
i think i don &apos;t need to explain what a big privilege is , today , to stand today .
this is the school that was built with the community .
something that we have in gando are the most powerful .
just like that .
good morning . magic is a great way to be able to make the difference to the world &apos;s energy , to make the difference that science really makes .
there &apos;s the color red and the color black , they &apos;re going to go to night for the end of day .
voice : why not ? this is a very good sheet .
this is an illusion .
so this is china , a civilization-state , and not so much a nation-state .
but you can &apos;t have a country like china , a civilization-state , on the basis of a civilization , a system .
and the reason is , first of all , the state in china gets a very special -- a very special amount of value than the representative , the embodiment and the the world &apos;s most chinese civilization , the world &apos;s embodiment .
he was in 1945 , in the way , filled with beijing and shanghai .
we &apos;ve seen this in terms of the simple -- the position of the position of the world &apos;s position , or the g8 .
he &apos;s going to the tracks on the tracks , and the cars drive below .
red = blue = blue bass &apos;s orange cobra , the red king of orange , is purple = the most powerful .
and the first song was on english , the second was on chinese .
she agreed to her song .
i made graffiti , i wrote my name everywhere , used the city as a canvas .
i mean , these were the faces of my friends .
they all accepted that their image would be taken next to each other .
&quot; you mean , you &apos;re a little bit of a face of a face -- that &apos;s a face , right here ? &quot;
and most places i went to , i decided to go because i heard about them in the media .
i took more pictures and we launched the project .
are you an ngo ? are you from the media ? &quot;
so the roofs were controlled , a woman , &quot; now , god can see me . &quot;
because this is a big part of it . there &apos;s layers behind each photo .
but they &apos;ve basically taken me a promise .
or , &quot; how can we help . &quot;
if i think about the mesh and what they &apos;re driving , why it &apos;s going to happen , i think there are some factors that i want to give you as a function of a car .
they &apos;ve been caused by a trend .
zipcar started a decade earlier , in 2000 .
it challenges to participation . cities have been welcome to participation in the way .
it &apos;s very cheap , and it &apos;s very , very cheap .
the last 40 years was extraordinary times .
and miniaturization .
that would produce a huge amount of energy .
it &apos;s vital that at ted , ideas , ideas that we think about , are very repetitive , and make sure that this is a particularly brilliant century , and not one of the most powerful and more of the world &apos;s .
my remaining family is boring academics who are involved in collecting the world &apos;s rights of the food system for our own .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet the prime minister . &quot;
i thought he was crazy , but something was really stuck .
i was sitting , like you , in the audience .
this is another picture .
since netra , my career has been able to get a lot of success .
i started exploring the most popular of the human psyche .
this time i said , let &apos;s try something else .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much better . einstein is very honored to be here at ted 2006 in the world today , and actually , it &apos;s very excited .
it would be very dangerous if you fall down .
sw : no , i don &apos;t have a problem . you have the problem , you remember ?
sw : big final .
sw : what about a computer keyboard ?
my parents found this important for their inner silence .
if i have a talent , it &apos;s things that i have to have , and i have a little bit of a time of that .
the body has higher density than the water is , at least 95 percent of the body comes from itself .
and this is going to get them very far .

they all have microbes and the small people used to put the little text into the receiver .
most pills , or the most sophisticated , you can eat , have a or two , maybe five species , and the human community has thousands of species .

and in the night i looked at my surgery , and i asked them , &quot; how am i going to do this ? &quot;

how are schools going to be shown in the media ?
in bureaucratic systems , teachers are going to leave in the classroom and have a lot of the time to keep themselves .
some people say that the change of the world &apos;s change is a bit like a viable .

but that explains the presence of the whole mass .
and now you pay attention to the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe -- a three-dimensional space .
again , this is a kind of a kind of a model of what &apos;s going on during the world &apos;s office .
they move away from each other because the space is going to be bigger .
by looking at things like clusters of galaxies -- their favorite , how many of you have a function of time -- we can bring in experience , which is dark matter and dark energy in order to form structures .

so let me tell you about a project that we did a few years later , a kind of a captcha of captcha .
basically , you &apos;re doing it by starting with a old book .
the number of pages that are actually using the recaptcha is actually so high that the number of words we &apos;re going to digitize a day is very , very large .
some are more fun .
now , the web is divided into several languages .
then my favorite story comes from the question .
there &apos;s a way to beat two flies with a broken .
but what &apos;s even more surprising is that we get the translations that we get from the most of the time , even if you &apos;re just a beginner that we &apos;re getting , the translations that we &apos;re getting , as well as professional professional , and that
and people are learning to be worth learning , they don &apos;t have to pay with money , they pay with their time .

and as an expert for inorganic chemistry , i have friends and colleagues who differ between organic , living world and the inorganic , the world .

we even have amazing life forms that we can manipulate .
and darwin himself asked himself to a colleague of a colleague that life probably came out in a warm small pond -- maybe not in scotland , maybe in africa , maybe somewhere else .
what is life ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can connect them and literally create thousands and thousands of really large molecules , in the same size , like dna and proteins , but it &apos;s not carbon in the view .
we want to put them in the environment and we want them to get their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can make inorganic biology and can make matter to evolve , then that &apos;s actually going to define life .
but there &apos;s another reason why i may be doing this development goal : every single one is going to measure .

so what can you do with these spectra ?
recently , a colleague was sent to berkeley , and a colleague of berkeley , a very interesting spectrum , and asked , &quot; can you look at this ? &quot;
there are two ways -- over the surface of the world , and the stars , and the stars , and the chemical elements in the universe , and they &apos;re being able to ruin .

what are you feeling vulnerable to ? &quot;
i &apos;m right , you don &apos;t have right . shut up .
we do that as if we do , not any impact on other people .
people are going to be the meals in twitter , the ambulance of their children on the iphone .
so if we think about it , they &apos;re using to make systematic improvements , then we think about how they can be useful to our own , for our environmental systems and self-awareness .
and today i want to talk about one of the things that we decided to do at the time , and we wanted to find a new access to health care .
so steven divides his story . but he &apos;s not alone .
here &apos;s why people pray .
i also love this kind of thing that was the only implant , also these were the only ones that were online and available .
and here we have a paper .
you don &apos;t have any data , you don &apos;t have data , that &apos;s not going to go to scientific methods .
this is the curve of the world &apos;s surface .
but my brother didn &apos;t go to the end .
if we went from here to the ted center , we would go to something that 300 feet high , 120 miles long , and that &apos;s two gigatons miles wide , and that weighs two gigatons .
to change the state , you just need two volts of a car .
we said , &quot; can you build that ? &quot;
we can do better .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that comes from the so-called so-called the so-called .
and the reason is networks are ideals of complex systems .
and it also has implications on the systems of the risk .
so we could put a computer tag in every single ranger .
we see the emergence of the creation and the programs that are focused on understanding our wired world from the standpoint of complexity .
so , the design capacity have a capacity to have a capacity with plastic skills -- except you use expensive pumps and valves .
and we had 500 of these profiles .
without human health .
so we were up on our own top .
and this graph doesn &apos;t even mean something that &apos;s invented data .
and my brain starts very quickly to think that this is a key representation of negative to positive in the world .
because this question is that our external world can predict our energy capacity , but the truth is that i can only predict 10 percent of the person &apos;s external world if i put their entire external world .
and this is a scientifically scientific , and it &apos;s been wrong with it .
we &apos;re moving people to write their own , a positive email of the world &apos;s brain or the most of the time in their social environment .
to say , a very difficult thing -- a more powerful , you understand -- my father was the most popular man on the world .
and so i went . i went to mit .
they said , do it stop .
they take a huge disk out of cardboard .
he was the first digital media company in tokyo .
listen to this ? how cows ? this is 4 a.m. in logan .
so there are all these things to do , but most of the love i love to learn the world .
and i was trying to do this with passion .
their culture is not coming in schools , and i want to illustrate them , how we can overcome this problem .
so that makes you nervous because girls don &apos;t want to go to schools where there are no boys .
and over little moments in my life .
or mothers who were raised to get young ?
we need to change the posture of boys in elementary school .
and you have the impression that you believe that would be okay .
let &apos;s see where this hypothesis is going .
is that a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we think that we can give us the &quot; why &quot; rules of nature can be given .
i &apos;m going to try and get the end , and i &apos;m also excited if it works .
and that was really a important lesson for me that you can &apos;t really act on an object .
we &apos;ve created a newspaper , for example , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s connected with my ipad , and it &apos;s a software that &apos;s going on on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a computer company , so i put it around a little bit , so that people in the glass are responding to different , if you &apos;re on the floor .
i &apos;m going to turn from my current age to a man , and then in a old man .
at 36 extra dimensions .
radio : what do you think of ?
just fold the wings together and drive them .
so i &apos;m going to ask you another question .
and he had a royal scholar , with a royal , who had instruction , and night , and night , but with the secret instruction , it didn &apos;t really make him good .
because they found that the human behavior is more powerful .
yet , we have to create a clear model of the world , which is what you can create , and it &apos;s a lot of fair .
now , if we all have these tools , we have to just ask the question -- and thaler and the design of this -- how we use these smart use .
they &apos;re going to lead the new food system .
they give small , more cosmopolitan , more cosmopolitan .
i felt passion , soul and heart , my body left .
audience : no .
sb : no , no , no .
all around us , we can find a different replicator in this kind of culture of culture .
they probably bought them .
imagine the world full of brains and more memes than the place for them .
we &apos;re the only ones and the most sophisticated .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
that was dangerous , but hello .
they use us to maximize the resource of the planet to produce more and more and more amazing things , and other amazing things that we hear here at ted .
and will we go through this third danger , how we &apos;ve passed the second and first one ?
in collaboration with the computer , that &apos;s the most popular in haiti -- with the ministry of public health , with various levels of food , we inspected more than 1,500 buildings .
it &apos;s not going to cost us anymore if we do it right . &quot;
and because i had burn to 70 percent of my body , all of the time was about an hour .
we also found that it would have been good , you would have given me to the pain of the pain .
and how bad would the punishment be if i was caught ?
it wasn &apos;t that the most popular people -- the ones who have more commandments -- less cheated , and that the less religious -- those who could remember almost no commandments -- more cheated .
so if you don &apos;t think about money , you &apos;re going to think about money , because you get a brand , does it make a difference ?
so it &apos;s like this .
i think all of these forces have very bad effects on the stock market .
but you can believe me . i work in the commercial .
these are the most popular ones i can show you today .
and suddenly amazon becomes the brand and competing with the reserve , defined , as you want to spend money , which is money and what it is .
maybe this seems to be too big ?
i don &apos;t have to tell you the audience , i had to explain it last week -- i had to explain it -- skeletons are structures that are sperm from one individual to another .
and i knew that animals like the most popular here , or even most animals don &apos;t stabilize their tissues by cutting them over bones .
and that was that every skeleton that we found up to the natural world , had the same kind of plastic that we had .
all i showed that was really surprised .
a funny song about global warming , jill sobule .
well , i guess i must .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a piece ?
and the other thing is , the benefits of the world , and the benefits of a great education .
the most amazing thing about this is , and ben became a more powerful .
so , what &apos;s the area of this character ?
i was forced to leave my home , the democratic republic of congo , where i was a lot of the time .
but remarkably , the united nations of the united nations has estimated the wealth of the country on 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not the goal .
they have to be very inexpensive .
but could not be done for this angle of labor ?
they were asking by governments , and they have a lot of cases , and they have them .
but let &apos;s take our goal to the goal of bringing new economic action to the base of the pyramid .
because they needed a whole bunch of these little transactions to make their profits .
he liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to be in his own bed .
since the landfill , when sir was a gentleman &apos;s name , and the british society for the u.k.
so , what is fusion ? here &apos;s something more .
and this energy is that it &apos;s burning fusion .
so , about this as a traditional power .
we need to make it a power station .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country , and it &apos;s also a big impact .
they wanted to be most of the democracy , but they were all the population that the population was in the last month , and they had been a civil opinion in the last month -- it was only four percent .
but the expectations of people were really important to the future .
so the question is , &quot; what drives the male support for women &apos;s women ? &quot;
i promise you , she read the message .
nobody can listen to you , just send them a text .
you could see the immediate impact of laws or the one of the most powerful speech on a computer , and see what happens as a result .
the flight took 12 seconds and went over 35 feet .
this is unnatural for a rocket .
it weighs less than a more powerful .
from the smallest of the mountain to the sheer forces of the nature of nature .
we can afford to do it as individuals and get us hearing .
we believe that somebody else , somebody else , somebody &apos;s favorite , somebody with more tools will solve this problem .
we didn &apos;t fly it in the pacific .
it took 10 full prototypes until we had something that really flew .
and so there &apos;s this incredible epiphany that is possible , which is possible , and that huge serious thing that means .
and let &apos;s think of our moral .
and the director was quite intimidating and said to me that he thought he was mad , and he said to me , &quot; this place is a facility facility . these guys are heavy offenders .
it took several such events to find out what i should do .
when i started with this program four years ago , my favorite plan was a computer plan of the computer .
and you look down , and you &apos;re looking down , everything is so small and tiny .
i feel blessed and happy that i had the courage to give my post on my lifetime at nyu and return to my country , where i can do this incredible rides with this group of children , morocco and russia .
and how often would my self have to die before i understand that it &apos;s not existed from the beginning ?
and i was a really good dancer .
oddly , these insights don &apos;t mean my most low sense of self-worth , this sense of otherness .
that was because i didn &apos;t have myself , what was in between .
imagine what kind of existence we could have , if we &apos;re suffering the inevitable death of self , the privilege of life , and to be happy , what &apos;s next .
and this is a cafe at the sea in the u.k.
but instead of looking at this , we focused on how we work .
we also discovered that as a structure of a structure and a more powerful way , we would get through this structure .
but we found that seeds -- this really important project , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , but that seeds -- in the leading botanical gardens , are not going to be made seeds .
we worked with a computer company to develop a seed seed of the seed seed , so even if you &apos;re visually impaired , it &apos;s kind of like a visually impaired and soft , the piece of landscape that you see here .
it &apos;s actually just the first few papers you &apos;re aware of , and the rest is only for postcards .
the book carries the title &quot; the blank slate , &quot; the popular idea because the human mind is a blank slate , and all his structure of his socialization , culture , education and experience .
well , there &apos;s a number of political reasons that you like to do good people .
it &apos;s still not clear , by the way , whether these generalizations are fit , but the most important thing seemed to be to support this .
another one of the humanities and the university of the universities that are actually in the demise of many ways .
well , the other hot iron is the parenting .
and i think you can &apos;t say that better .
i also call it portland , just like this , and you don &apos;t like it , but you &apos;re not suggesting it .
there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no nonsense .
he says , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i think right now . &quot;
oh , i live in a computer program -- that &apos;s strange .
so i asked myself what would happen if we challenge some of these things .
right ?
it &apos;s like this -- we &apos;ve explained the war , as a society , every one of us .
your iphone without the people who are the same skin , same circuitry , same keyboard , always and again .
and then it became more aggressive and more powerful and now it &apos;s a little bit more important .
and i said to brian , &quot; what did tony do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; so is it true that you &apos;re in the wrong ? &quot;
but how do you sit in a regular way ?
so all of the things that were coming on tony &apos;s office , evidence of his clinician , is that he was crazy in this new way .
he came in failing in failing and more and 30 percent of the workforce , and it turned american cities just like this in the wild .
and i added , &quot; i have a list of psychopathic features in my pocket .
and the jewelry are always the opposite aspects of the personality of the part .
and that &apos;s what it was like two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended .
in fact , the trend went to the rest of the world .
and as a result of these conversations , it &apos;s very , very difficult to say , i represent the true islam . &quot;
it may be that a big war between east and west was used , and that it was necessary in the framework of democracy against communism .
and even though the president , for reasons , made it very , very well , really , really , to be able to get islam to the enemy , is nonetheless , a natural impulse in the other side of the other side than enemy .
when the treasure in 2000 , you saw the peak of the best , the scientists who had the scientists for african penguins -- who had been in this moment as endangered species of the world &apos;s species .
the day after our arrived , two of us were faced with the record of space 2 , and space two more than 4,000 with oil , and there were two more than 4,000 oiled penguins .
we &apos;ve used this method in the treasure rescue .
and that &apos;s really important because the african penguin was explained to a endangered species .
on the top row , at the bottom row , the most prolific , a computer center , in the front of the police and even before the police station .
people are open to the most open .
we launched this campaign -- very comfortable -- &quot; every egg counts &quot; every egg .
this is not a second grade of the second grade .
these lessons came out of the face , abstract .
hillel turned on a leg and said , &quot; what you &apos;re doing is not to do your neighbor . that &apos;s the most important thing . the rest is comments .
now , this is not the whole story .
and achilles takes a body body and the hands of the father , and the two men see each other and see each other as divine .
this is what the cells really look at me in biology and science , looking at living cells in the microscope .
every grain of sand has a size of a millimeter .
you can see these kinds of things .
this picture was the beginning of the world &apos;s first .
we all look at the same from the inside , believe me .
the walls are 700 millimeters thick , solid concrete .
and that &apos;s a x-ray on the left .
it has human associations .
in x-ray , we see all the little bits of glass in the corners .
i had to have the car in the middle of the center , and i &apos;ve seen no simple task .
yes , they &apos;ve been given 12 monkeys a week , and after this week , they just used them as a toilet .
the science is actually saying that we &apos;re going to live forever .
no , i &apos;m a tooth .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you . goodbye .
where do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we &apos;re both not going to agree .
not professor and convicted , only two spirits , ready to be ready .
and then my life was fine .
all i saw in the manufacturing was that it was right intellectual between the u.s. and the most cosmopolitan .
would you even be time to process information ?
we spent a lot of time with this , a billion dollars , and they &apos;re hearing right -- a billion of the world &apos;s worth of testing , which he was involved in , and what we found was shocking , but later , more .
then there &apos;s dan etete .
we were upset that these companies had rapidly their own business companies , and the most important in london , they were very fond of them .
this is too complex and difficult to change it .
we &apos;re going to die all the time . we &apos;re going to all be sick . we &apos;re all going to leave people .
there are places that you can &apos;t go to , thoughts that you can &apos;t think of , worlds that you can &apos;t inhabit .
they have a more powerful and freedom that i believe is the foundation of a new new york system .
she made the decision , not getting a more powerful or a more powerful , but your life is devoted to that that this is not happening any other girl .
we &apos;re all refugees .
but you &apos;re going to give me this thing to the head , and then it happens .
but this isn &apos;t what you do . &quot;
i miss michael .
he didn &apos;t find it , but he didn &apos;t find him , but said , &quot; you &apos;re going to the recovery , or you &apos;re going to die and die . &quot;
ah ! we meet them , the secret beloved . let &apos;s pull them out .
if it &apos;s on the box , which is the most powerful , it &apos;s going to form .
the characteristics that are the word of the word are so often to see in adults that we should eradicate this age of age , if it comes to criticize the age of being able to criticize behavior and irrational thinking .
if i had the ability to get my sister back to the 10 percent interest that i &apos;ve been struck with her last loan , i will be constrained by her ability to get more money from me to get it back .
it &apos;s why we don &apos;t live in the dark times .
and the third is all the sounds we create people who are creating the most powerful .
this is after selective logging .
there are many of the most powerful of forestry , among other things , the way animals have taught us and singing that i have a different time .
so that was extremely embarrassing .
and if you wonder how much that is , this is 16 kb here .
so 37 is our audience .
it &apos;s very impressive and a very beautiful concert .
and these are the themes that are actually the heart of the heart .
a generation that &apos;s so much more important from video games , when it &apos;s the real world .
all of these are problems outside my own .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of video games means for our civilization .
finally ! finally ! that &apos;s it .
it would be really good for him .
so , you get fast from the simple to complex , if you do more . that &apos;s what we like .
and then they look at them , and they &apos;re a pain -- i thought that at least long , until they explained to me , that &apos;s what they &apos;re thinking about , so they think .
it &apos;s going to go to the other direction .
girl : there was a bullet and a computer ball , because it &apos;s two completely different , and if you fall down , you may fall down .
but we could not train a thousand new teachers to save our lives .
and it &apos;s a very important thing . &quot;
and ultimately , we &apos;re going to change ourselves as we have changed the world around us .
that &apos;s going to have incredible implications .
why do they do what they do ?
everybody would want to want the new version .
they affect us too much .
they &apos;re actually going to come up with this point .
i &apos;m going to get to the order of the words in the order .
&quot; well , yes , &quot; i said , &quot; strange , you ask that .
and they said , &quot; you don &apos;t need to do that again . &quot;
we looked at it , and i was grateful because she said , &quot; wow ! that &apos;s insane . &quot;
the goal of the project is very simple .
this is completely personalized medicine in the field of water .
now the answer is a team of a team .
i work with the millennium and the most serious thing that some serious problems have been given to the project , problems that should not have been .
in medicine , there are so many people who don &apos;t want to change change , not right , if a nuclear engineer has the answer .
you can really find novel solutions that haven &apos;t been seen before , and that &apos;s just very quickly .
yes , good , you guys get me to my life because it was a little bit of a good , beautiful , beautiful , kind of , form of beautiful , form of beautiful .
no , but it &apos;s true : the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i met the most popular .
and i didn &apos;t ask them to draw nice cartoons .
thank you .
so , &quot; our lonely earth &quot; brought me all a lot of the meeting with the audience .
we &apos;ve been doing a lot of time for the existence of animals on this planet as they &apos;ve been here , until we &apos;ve been reaching the second microbial era .
his impact is the distribution of these very thin , very thin things about the whole planet , and we had a very , very strict death of dinosaurs , death of this beautiful , white , and so much else .
it &apos;s the supreme crisis , the t. rex .
they hate us animals .
this is when material comes from the deep earth and the surface , spread over the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m a little bit away from the coast , which is going to happen to me ?
they have an accident . they have two options : they &apos;re going to die , or they take the hydrogen sulfide and , say 75 percent of them will be saved , mentally .
so , blessing : blessing and curse .
some of you are countries who are the opinion that deregulation or even no regulation of the best way is to promote investments .
the answer is simply : the chinese define these factories as chemical businesses , not as a matter of a chemical , and they don &apos;t check them .
i don &apos;t know what we can do , but i can use my office at least to bring them together to create a solution . &quot;
they need a safe environment .
now , we have the impression that it &apos;s the beginning of a new way of regulation of international tasks .
human rights is a very simple question : can i give this people back to this ?
or to find the young , the young that has laid the fire to see if you can change it . &quot;
okay , ready ? go .
i was fire and the flame .
again , we saw the spoken word poetry of walls .
after the fight , he shook his head , and he said , &quot; you &apos;re a god . &apos; &apos; no , you &apos;re a god . &quot;
i travel a lot when i teach , and i don &apos;t always get to see my students , but i had the lucky step to see her , but i had the lucky one to see her journey as she did .
my parents have called me sarah , which is a name of a name .
i want to first talk about some ideas that have driven me to become a more powerful .
when i saw that the war for everyone was incredibly rich , and that the most amazing thing was actually going to be a factor in conflict conflict , i wanted to be a photographer to be a war war .
at the same time in south africa , after nelson mandela had been released from prison , the black population was the last phase of liberation .
the next day i went to rwanda , and it was when i was up in the hell of hell .
after the fall of the fall of the rock in indonesia , i started exploring the conditions of poverty in a country that was on the way to modernization .
a hospital of the doctors without borders in a refugee camp .
the most efficient thing is that the percentage of the soldiers , the percentage of the soldiers , is a lot higher than in any other history of our history .
so to make sure that so little things can be wrong , we have all these procedures in the choice .
so you pick up this way .
but this is a broad and pretty difficult topic , so i had to be quoted .
the size is the population -- big china , here &apos;s big india .
and in all eastern religions , japan was the same level .
because death is going to be a child &apos;s death with another child .
and what is the reason in qatar ?
they have a great job .
all religions in the world are able to maintain their values and adapt to these new world .
and then , like all of our generation , we lived in a field of a hospital .
day eight .
in india alone , my favorite friends and i went to door to the door with this same image , to every single house in india , and we did over a billion of the world .
this is the most important thing .
i asked them -- it &apos;s all the kind of stuff -- and i asked them to ask them to ask them to ask them .
i think we owe debt to the acquisition and ron st. john john , i hope , ron is somewhere in the audience -- over there -- he &apos;s the founder of gphin .
larry brilliant : first , are you not mad because of the injury of copyright rights ?
have a set of a set of wood , &quot; the climate group . &quot;
why should we have a positive impact on the world , on the world , as a company ?
they save 85 percent of electricity with a led that they had used with a old light bulb .
sometimes people think that 100 percent will be pretty hard , and we had this conversation in the company .
a more motivated person paid himself in seven or eight years .
from our 17,000 health lab in the entire ikea , we &apos;re 47 percent women , but that &apos;s not enough and we want to close this gap and to the high management of the way to the high management .
there was a equation in my family , about this : if you &apos;re intelligent , you &apos;re not spiritual .
this , he wrote , &quot; he &apos;s the continuity of reality . &quot;
somebody whose attitude you can do , or you can take steam from your ears .
and the end of our computer system , we realized the openness of the other .
as i would go back to bangalore , i would often go back to a vibrant argument with my friends , where we discussed different themes , while they were being rejected by new issues , where a drink is often paid more than what they were paying for
he looks for forgiveness , and he says that he wants to improve life of his child child .
this pakistani seemed to be quite happy , and it didn &apos;t have a deaths to be killed even though dozens of people had killed in liberia .
and how are we responsible for that ?
it &apos;s alarming -- not ? -- that the media of the world is doing such a bad job that a small group of activists is able to publish more of this kind of information than the rest of the press combined .
j yeah . this was the cover of the guardian and it was then printed around kenya , in the world &apos;s office , and south african press .
j the effects on people who worked on it were strong .
and there &apos;s lots of information .
i would be interested in what we &apos;ve heard about -- i &apos;m curious about the ted audience .
and we said , &quot; oh , tell us more .
so you have to be careful with the term hackers .
and only one month ago , it was passed all the way from the ted parliament to parliament .
and from all these numbers , i start with only two or three variables .
this piece here can be read very differently , depending on where you &apos;re going to be .
first , i read about this in a complaint at a time of a computer , which was a responsible for responsible medicine and seven to seven .
so according to this study , the best thing is to make it not too short to a chicken , but not too long in the way that it &apos;s going to be black , and a little bit of a gear , and a rubber of juice ,
and then the next summer i worked under the line of dr. kamen at the fort worth of gold , texas .
and this realization is incredibly for efficiency of chemotherapy , perhaps for many different types of cancer .
for example , volatile organic compounds are chemical pollutants that are found in our schools , and in our schools , and they &apos;re found .
because all of these solutions are , of course , they &apos;re sustainable and they &apos;re more powerful -- they &apos;re a lot of the way to our generation and for the next generations .
and immediately , a voice called &quot; kangaroo ! &quot;
after the conference , after my talk , people came to me , men and women .
hard !
a prosthetic is not a need for the need to shrink a lack of scarcity .
we &apos;re all different from different perspectives .
i was in the beijing games of the olympic games .
about 80 percent of these are young people , among 30 percent .
and they &apos;re most unemployment , and they &apos;re the most unemployment , the banks , the banks of the banks , the coal of the country , the food of europe and america of the products that they produce .
they have a kind of a form that can break them on a piece of chicken or fish , and it looks like cattle .
people think about the following questions : will we continue to save our environment more to a greater gdp ?
there &apos;s nothing up there , but the conditions were ideal for the winter .
now , the series hasn &apos;t been done even , so they &apos;re the first ones to see this .
mars is similar to the earth , it seems to be equally damaging .
sousa was afraid that we were losing the opportunity to be quote , quote , &quot; machines , &quot; they would take us .
but more importantly , bmi used to use overall works to create new kinds of energy that they put free to their clients , and then in 1940 , when they were executed , the majority of the card was being adopted , the majority of the user &apos;s
and i ...
for the balance i &apos;m trying to do , i &apos;m going to try to be a good liberal , of course , to ask a little bit of the government . a mistake , right ?
this realization is incredibly provocative , incredibly provocative .
okay , i don &apos;t want to alert any abstract , but i just noticed that the person on the right is a liar .
&quot; honey , you don &apos;t see fat , no . &quot;
another study , however , showed that strangers are lying in the first 10 minutes of their own .
here &apos;s koko with her kittens .
i &apos;ll say it again .
and you know , liars don &apos;t look at the eyes .
we say , &quot; yes , &quot; while we shake the head .
science has taken a lot more signs on the daylight .
look at exactly the same and you &apos;ll see the whole video in the world .
in this way , in this way , it can be useful for us to be a little bit more clear in terms of our moral rules .
and that &apos;s not true , right ?
you know , we often think that language is the world that we live in , but that &apos;s not true .
so what &apos;s going on as a computer designer , if not even tragic joke about harry , is acting as ethnic .
six months after that , without any explanation , they let me free .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m making .
when i was 10 , i read james , &quot; take a country &quot; take a country , &quot; and i was broken .
a new song i proposed to you .
so i took a little time to study coke .
and in the remote areas of africa , it &apos;s hard to find a good road .
how do you make them incentive to affect the effects that you have on these remote villages ?
i don &apos;t think so attractive as &quot; aw &quot; .
they &apos;re waiting to be cut .
much more people were being magnets .
today i &apos;m going to tell you two things . first , what we lost , and second , how we get it .
here you can see the largest part of the living of the florida &apos;s florida .
if there &apos;s no fishing in a reef , because it &apos;s a little bit protected , or isolation , it &apos;s great .
after a few years after five to seven years , the fish come back , food , the sea sea , and then the algae grow again .
you can see the border of the world &apos;s surface , because there are all the boats back there .
if it &apos;s so good , if that &apos;s so easy , how much is it ?
so the protection of the sea is the sea and the ocean for a ski for funding and the ocean , and that &apos;s not acceptable .
in the coral reefs , we found that the pyramid is the equivalent of the equivalent of the world &apos;s equivalent to where five lions come to a giant surface .
okay , enric , thank you for having a part of your spiritual experience . thank you .
it turns out it &apos;s been proven to be the longest creature in the ocean .
they come to the submersible -- they come to the window , and they look at the submersible .
and in other words , we &apos;re trying to take our partners in woods , and this virtual world -- this world , this kind of unexplored area -- to get into the lab .
bl : these worms don &apos;t have a dance system . they don &apos;t have a mouth .
what we &apos;ve seen was from the pacific .
we &apos;re going to try to show you the pacific in the ocean .
these worms grow several centimeters in the week .
the concept of the design system is zero .
and the rest of the one percent is looking for the formula that you can apply in the situation .
they also have the mathematical structure that &apos;s from the surface of the pyramid , measurements , points , points , axes , and so on .
the students have to create these tools . they have to make them .
and the best thing , or one of the best parts , is that we don &apos;t get the answer from the end of the world &apos;s rights .
what &apos;s happening with the small hadron collider ?
here you find the fastest growing young population in the world .
it &apos;s a lot of the time . there &apos;s no government schools in the slums .
this is a computer that was installed on the entrance to your slum , by a disruptive social entrepreneur called sugata mitra , who took the most sophisticated experiments that showed that kids can learn under certain conditions , with help of a computer .
well , the key is motivation , and it &apos;s in two ways .
this is a school in a bus on a site in pune who &apos;s the fastest growing city of asia .
they should turn it into a mcdonald &apos;s .
there are formal scales , schools , health schools , hospitals , where innovation can happen , and informal environments , communities , families , social networks .
every child to age 15 , which is a place in a school , will be able to get in 2015 .
and while i look at him , this scene comes to tears , and i &apos;ve been doing it for 25 years .
here &apos;s a couple of parents from teenagers ? all right , we have to cook for them -- and they &apos;re eating every night for two , three or four in the way . it &apos;s ridiculous .
he &apos;s going to go all over and eat everything !
these gay people like me , like i want to be , are treated as full citizens , and it &apos;s written directly before our nose .
there &apos;s a lot of fear to do , so you don &apos;t show who you &apos;re really , here at home , and it &apos;s not just about north carolina ; it &apos;s not just north carolina .
think about it .
and i got scared .
about three years ago , i read a paper in the new york times .
who were my grandparents ?
it helps us become what we could have been .
this is how evolution works .
and in fact , here &apos;s this insect .
i &apos;d smell one of the things that i did before .
it &apos;s not just about 43 to 44 degrees c , for about two days , but it &apos;s keeping a constant temperature .
but the contrast is about this . it &apos;s going to be going to be the background .
here &apos;s the russians , and yes , it was -- it was -- actually -- a game .
she started telling me , and all the parents here are going to recognize the most popular .
i have an irish story .
our lives will be determined by data , and the presentation of this data is to create a fantastic interface that can tell great stories .
i &apos;ve also thrown a look at the different types of dna , because you can pick what you want to highlight from the data data .
it &apos;s a man &apos;s husband who &apos;s sitting in the box and controls this kind of thing .
a more 11 of about 11 sheep per hour , which is a kind of a paleontologist of 68 cents .
in the reason , you can -- what you see on the left is the most powerful , and on the right you see the frame of the frame of 16 people who didn &apos;t know what they &apos;re doing .
selam bell : exploit , slave ... aaron ... aaron , and we took all these pieces and we took them into another mechanical turk .
but we knew we needed to do the right person to make us feel like this and to build something .
and below all the individual frames , people have submitted to the project .
thank you .
so i made rows of images , cut , and put them together in the wild .
a memorable consequence of that is that you &apos;re always seeing one part of his image , and that leads to a very free structure .
and sometimes i have an emotional response to news , like the earthquake in haiti .
then i went 50 kilometers , then 60 kilometers .
it &apos;s like the different layers of the ones we &apos;re doing , and what we &apos;re doing is to present the world as our identity .
another thing is in a public library in san jose , california .
so every building has its own personality .
it may be easier than ever before , to make a good living .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re particularly materialistic .
it &apos;s just too weird .
you know , in the middle ages , in england , if you met somebody who was very poor , you called this one &quot; unhappy &quot; . literally , somebody who was lucky , the fate of the fate , not a more powerful .
and it will be done with the youngest court with angels and legends , and the sky will open .
i then told you the action of spontaneous chaplin .
what i think i really talked about is success and failure .
we should make sure that we are really the creator of our own ambition .
alain de botton : a more unpredictable , gentler
if you train for this sport , you don &apos;t smile .
you know , you swim with your goggles , and you swim 60 trains per minute , so you &apos;re never really on something like that , you don &apos;t see good .
they &apos;re in the liquid .
my breath is down three to three main points .
and i &apos;m going to worry about that , i didn &apos;t make them .
i swam with this thing .
it &apos;s the only one that &apos;s interested in me .
that &apos;s already what we have today .
the gateway can be a smartphone , or it could be a special gateway , like today , a lot of these things are special , because they &apos;re not so good .
many of you have got the phillips direct life .
this is a very important part of our life . we should sleep a third of our lives .
ok . let &apos;s go from sleep to disease .
so we can change medicine in the field of medicine , in all ages , from counting children , or to the seniors , changing the arena , the entire spectrum of the disease -- i hope i &apos;ve got a sense of this -- about the globe .
so , i hope i &apos;ve convinced you -- the effects on the top of the world are enormous and the effects on disease are also amazing in all these different diseases and more .
how do we create robust societies ? longevity .
and in the novel , a certain so-called called alvin , and he says , maybe it &apos;s not the best way , and it &apos;s destroyed all the system .
and so there are no more sophisticated ones .
and it &apos;s a great thing .
snares should be faster .
maybe you wonder how we do this kind of thing .
our only cookbook is the world &apos;s only cookbook in the partial world .
this is the finished hamburger .
a talk about surgical robots is also a talk about surgery .
and surgeons were more business than doctors .
but ultimately , the woke up .
they had to give their intuitive movements with the instruments .
i &apos;ve told you about the big , complicated robot .
and as you can see , it &apos;s going to be something that &apos;s going to be useful to do something useful , that &apos;s not so much of that .
and we don &apos;t even have to be constrained to this kind of thing .
we &apos;re here to talk about accidents .
but we had a problem .
okay , well , it was partly my fault .
we don &apos;t just show that bacteria can be the solution to plastic waste , but also that the openness to the energy of the world is allowing us to do the other thing that &apos;s going to be unexpected and that &apos;s the risk of risk .
the film we &apos;re going to see is made for the most important , in new york .
i &apos;m not there .
it went on . they always tried to make things better .
they don &apos;t say , &quot; our style are curves . let &apos;s make the house curved . &quot;
i think in my family , we had a lot of happiness , because we &apos;ve learned to go backwards .
dawn , very good !
ed : and then the row of the row is a historical site , because in the middle of the history of paris , the beginning of the story has taken their beginning , where the message has been true .
you see this chair ? the orange one ? this is the orange chair chair .
because it &apos;s part of where we want to get .
it was a lot of outrage . they were full of speculation . they were a little bit of a solid information .
one of them is known : the population population , the population population , has gone from two to almost seven billion people in the last 50 years .
brent lawson : being here .
you see the lines check out when the population population is happening .
before i talk about the cost , i have to hold very clear that i &apos;m very clear that i &apos;m going to hold it .
this is what liberation looks like .
but only since recently , we can , thanks to technical progress , now the quantum locking and quantum locking .
first of all , some strands of magnetic field in inner spaces are trapped , but the superconductor doesn &apos;t like it if they &apos;re moving , because their movements use energy , and so the most important thing .
and of course , this round magnet can also expand to form a variety of positions .
and it was inspired by this quote from douglas adams , the situation is from &quot; hitchhiking through the galaxy . &quot;
because of course , they don &apos;t explain how to do that , if you want to do it , and not have a more powerful .
but even though they were not convinced they were , &quot; okay , we call back . &quot;
so , yes , i have .
so some of you will say , &quot; what will happen if moore &apos;s law hits its limits ? &quot;
today you can buy half a billion . and you &apos;re even better , because you &apos;re faster .
but where are we going to get the software ?
larry page has thought about a passionate speech on our computer lab , which he &apos;s doing for this great challenges of humanity .
they wanted to catch the fish .
this may sound insignificant , but it &apos;s incredibly frightening to hear a lot of rumors that another one of the other rumors , greater than the last , is going to come to the last 13 o &apos;clock or maybe tonight ...
so the tsunami can be seen as a kind of an analog moment , a moment where the blogosphere was kind of grown up .
probably it &apos;s within three to five percent of the number of jellybeans in the glass , and it would be better than the estimate of 90 to 95 percent of them .
somebody has links , so other people link , etc . , etc .
he &apos;s finished his favorite , and i &apos;ll put a lot of heavy to a thousand pounds of paper with low plans , but he just says , &quot; that &apos;s all i want to do . &quot;
so i &apos;ll show you now 30 seconds of film , and i &apos;m going to show you a little bit about the thing .
this habitat is covered more than all the other habitats in the world .
many of us , i &apos;m locked in , think that the exploitation of the oceans are only in the last 50 or maybe 100 years , and maybe 100 years of it was really serious .
this is a cable connected to the surface of the vehicles , and hands for the work on the sea floor .
so there &apos;s a barcode on this product that &apos;s telling the computer exactly what the product is .
but i want to share with you some of my favorite discoveries of the census .
we don &apos;t know why they do that , we just don &apos;t know .
this graph is based on a brand brand , which is going to appear in the journal of biology .
but that &apos;s not all of it .
as an architect , i have something to confront .
mitchell sagmeister : don &apos;t build a house , grow it !
i think that &apos;s very interesting , and very encouraging , because what you &apos;ve heard in the last few days is the sense of walking in different directions : directions that are specific and unique for the problems .
now , we all think that the most obvious of romantic poet was a great romantic poet , many of us forget that he wrote some wonderful essays , and the most famous essay is a word called &quot; a defense of poetry . &quot;
i &apos;m going to read you this .
and at a certain time of his life , they &apos;re going to be on rocks .
but let me show you the latest robotic technology .
when you used to , before the digital radio , the railway station , and &quot; the &quot; s &quot; on the board , that was this noise .
the basic idea of the design of the world &apos;s basic is that you have two sources of information that are going to be the conclusions .
that means i need to make predictions about the future .
now , there &apos;s a very clear example where a lot of me feel very different about that , when it &apos;s been produced by another person .
and in the meantime , i got two daughters .
so they didn &apos;t know the rules that the other person plays .
if these dots were cars on a mountain table , they would have no idea what &apos;s going on .
we &apos;ve shown that we can explain a big part of the data -- people actually plan their movements to be very , very precise to the negative consequences of noise .
this is from the ocean iv iv pacific .
mars has the largest largest energy system of the solar system , the most powerful .
this is my favorite . it was taken only a few weeks ago .
the oldest stone on earth is just 3.6 billion .
and the result of our meeting was a very , a computer called ares .
we fold it , and we transport it in a spacecraft .
this is about the street , oregon .
i think there &apos;s a lot of this packaging here -- &quot; eight to 12 . &quot;
and there was a guy who sold these weapons for lego , because lego -- the most delicious -- no , they &apos;re not on guns .
and then there are some examples of the stuff that are real sculptures .
i have to tell you , for me , it changed everything .
perhaps most importantly , the impact on other companies is enormous .
in fact , politics is called the most of the world &apos;s .
in brazil , there are now 18 times more than 700 times , whereas the united states only have 700 , and in the california , two years of california -- and within three years , the percentage of the four percent is up to 85 percent .
this is not a very big thing . biofuels are a really big thing .
scientists explain us -- and these are just estimates -- that we have to cut the dollar emissions half , and that &apos;s how fast we can .
i can &apos;t wait to do what we &apos;re doing to tedsters against the crisis .
there are fewer people who are still available , which are you , and then you get this kind of thing , and you get this classic , and you get this classic curve curve .
b is on the edge of the network .
and that &apos;s what happens to each other .
the red dots are going to be the most powerful , and the yellow dots are going to be friends of people with flu .
would you get immunity on the ground ?
and there are , i think , three ways of being used to this data data .
the building was in construction until the collapse of the economy and death of the world &apos;s beginning to start .
although it seems to be a completely chaotic place , if you see it from top , there seems to be a whole net of the internet and channels that connect every single house .
in this tradition , the future bride shows all their possessions that they &apos;re going to bring their new husband to .
what a place like the norwegian david is particularly remarkable is this kind of kind of thing that people have , where people can use a basis to use them .
we can only ask , &quot; how are the most important of the design of the world &apos;s genome ? &quot; and what we &apos;re going to do is , or what else we want to ask .
it has replaced the workers through technology .
you can see some symbols on the left , some symbols that show what &apos;s going on with his right arm .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re getting older .
or even if we get much older , our cars are going to drive to go to people .
they were gone in a moment .
it &apos;s always been more obvious that we can &apos;t win .
the two specialists behind the curtain will help me bring the result to the screen .
one of the journalists asked , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
the evangelical ones are the same as jewish breeding .
i think there are some , actually , many reasons , but here &apos;s just some of us on the verge of a little bit .
he was attracted by the fire , he painted her , he was like a little bit of a light , a little bit of a computer .
let me go from door to the door to the international community , and see if somebody is there , or the troops for these robots .
but for sergio , it was too late .
he saw her .
brewster power : a complicated hero
this means jobs and possibilities of all the things along the way .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about the free of food , because it was actually this year , last year , and 2008 , in the middle of the world , and in 2008 , for every single pound of calories .
and i go into these stores when they &apos;re there , or out in the fields to see what they can get , and i realize they can &apos;t get food .
we see changes of participation in schools .
i want to talk about something that i call digital food .
and what i found is that instead of investing in subsidies and other things , invest in a school program .
thank you .
we could do the same thing at cancer .
they &apos;re not going to go longer to a drug .
it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a kind of a device , not because it shows me how many of the people i &apos;m doing every day , but because it &apos;s 24 hours long , which i do .
that &apos;s never shown .
the productivity of these magnets is so big that we can see a single neutron of a neutron .
you don &apos;t have to shrink the tumor .
if the magnet is big enough , and your resolution high enough , you can actually all be able to get all the proteins in the body and start to understand the individual system .
most of us find that comforting , and interestingly , 12 vibrations per minute about the most violent person .
for example , if i put this -- longer than a few seconds , you would feel uncomfortable ; you would feel uncomfortable than a few minutes , and you would leave the hall in circulation .
that &apos;s all recognized . and that &apos;s the tune that &apos;s at the most common time in the world .
and i was there with two very good friends of mine , richard milliken and kevin chaplin .
as we cross miles and miles from the street , frozen , the north african could be the most .
so , like i &apos;m here today , and you talk to you , i went to the ted revolution about five years .
just 10 miles before the coast and in the north coast of depth .
the ocean is climate and weather , and they keep the temperature stable and shapes the chemistry of the world .
so , there are easy ...
this is the result , if you don &apos;t know , that there are boundaries for what we need to take the oceans .
in the last three years , the u.s. for example , the u.s. , for example , have been protected by the u.s.
we need submersibles , new technologies to explore the ocean .
a lot of my early career , i wanted to figure out how the wings of the insects generate enough power to keep themselves in the air .
let &apos;s study this idea of simplicity .
this is a beautiful picture of visual music of a mouse from jeff , and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk .
they &apos;re a little bit of a design trip to make some behavior , a different kind of behavior , a different kind of brain , and patterns and you can think that this works in a very complicated system .
our mission is to build a more powerful and realistic computer model of the human brain .
he &apos;s home and drinking tea .
if you look closer to the neocortex of the neocortex , you &apos;re going to be out of louder components , and it &apos;s a little bit of the components of the brain , like in a computer .
how many per type of tree is there ? where are they turning ?
we can look at the tissue . and we can change neurons .
we can upload all these neurons , every single one in its own processor , it activate , and watch what happens .
so , the other thing that &apos;s called the secrets of the brain is that the secrets of the brain can be solved , mental illness , memory , perceptions : they &apos;re made of neurons and electrical signals , and he &apos;s planning to be able to do
it would be necessary two or three thousand bombs .
the air force started building smaller models , and started this .
this is what nasa did to get a more powerful , which would fly to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about the behavior of the behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write . because there &apos;s so much resonance that you can get from people .
the bottom ? yellow .
if you ask people that question , they usually think that it has something to do with culture .
the countries on the right , the ones that give a lot of , have a slightly different form .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this .
but to get it back , it &apos;s going to be more complex .
a online quarry for 59 dollars .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we really don &apos;t know our biases so well .
in fact , in medical terms , this is our view .
and radio waves are limited .
in infrared , you can only use the eyes of the eyes with lower energy .
their intensity can be very quickly modified and it can be turned off very quickly .
they &apos;re critical .
but that &apos;s just by the way .
cars have a lot of time and the water and they can communicate with each other and can communicate through the car lights and so on .
dna is what &apos;s mean to life .
because it &apos;s actually not so many data .
you have the genome of the genome , and the power of this is a custom medicine that is better than today -- it has no side effects .
he &apos;s really just -- just just just got a gene -- but we could completely get it completely embarrassed .
we &apos;re not running as small organisms alone on the world , but they &apos;re part of a big ecosystem .
the consequences can be bad -- if we &apos;re poisoning ourselves or the earth -- but that &apos;s just the consequence of one of us .
now i &apos;m mostly here because there &apos;s a kind of digging in dog dog at the moment where we have a side of people who think that you &apos;re putting a dog , first of all , by making a dog , human rules .
they &apos;re just like &quot; the &quot; s &quot; , just beating . and therefore they &apos;re going to beat .
no , we &apos;re doing &quot; puppy , sit . &quot; -- boom , he can try to get it six to 10 .
they &apos;re like golden logging .
and i would say , if you don &apos;t need it , you might not be able to be .
not only with the puppy , but also with the rest of the family .
these are the same things that are so simple .
their children are just to train .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , and this windmill -- does it work ?
wk : yeah . i still think about working with energy .
because even though i &apos;ve used scientific terms in songs , it &apos;s sometimes very hard to make them sound .
and even less , if it &apos;s accompanied by the oil and the most powerful , like in my case .
one is a white flash of light .
64 with 75 multiply .
let &apos;s look at the third question .
the desert continued to expand a mile or two a year .
the homo erectus made the same tool over 30 generations of the way .
you can teach you in the lab , a little bit of trade-offs , and there &apos;s also a more different thing in other animals , but the exchange of a object is never happening .
it &apos;s the wealth of the own needs , saving your own needs .
we &apos;ve achieved that as a species .
but there &apos;s no evidence for that .
and when people started to do objects like this , the way that they had a very long time , that was a clue that a exchange between groups existed .
but who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
but i &apos;m also because of the connections that people are taking , and that &apos;s never where they have a lot of the ideas to meet and mate and mate . i &apos;m also sure that technology is going to continue to move further and better .
this is as high as a building building . i &apos;ve got the statue of the statue as compared to the computer .
but we don &apos;t talk about it , we don &apos;t take it seriously .
they &apos;re just gone , these feelings , they &apos;re gone .
if we think about the most sophisticated detection detection detection , usually the fast development is the problem because how can we discover things that are constantly changing ?
i &apos;ve talked about this -- you know , you know , if you don &apos;t get diagnosis in the hospital ?
what about real people ?
we did a part of their viruses ; they &apos;re new , far , far , the rhinoviruses .
after 10 more days , she came back -- still , still -- she &apos;s still a fever -- she &apos;s got a little bit of oxygen in your lungs .
it wasn &apos;t even sequenced very often .
it &apos;s a classic retrovirus , but it &apos;s completely new . nobody has seen it before .
a huge battery could already do that .
instead , we &apos;re instead of making something that fits to the most of the design of the world &apos;s brain .
i brought a little bit of density up with low density , a high density of dense down , and a water salt in between .
but david is young and clever and he wants to make a computer game , and so he builds -- he &apos;s building the first metal metal with this chemical composition .
so what do we learn from all of this ?
this video was taken in the south atlantic , six kilometers before the coast of the coast of the coast of the coast of the sea , about 20 feet below the surface of the sea .
quickly , we realized that our garage was not big enough for this growing project .
i started to get to maria , and her methods to interest and how it was important , and how important it found that kids discover things themselves and they &apos;re not taught to be taught to be a open way of open .
evolution is often seen as this one way that we chose , but it represents a big number of possibilities .
i &apos;m going to skip this to the stage of space .
our cities are at risk because many of them are on the coast .
there are stars and so forth .
so if we think about the behavior of the behavior or language language , as it &apos;s called the social social revolution , it turns around language . so we think about communication .
this expression , as a pride , was known by jessica tracy , and she showed that people and birth were born in blind people , and they do that when they win a little bit of a time .
so i thought about it . you know , you &apos;re on these people and see how they &apos;re involved . could you get them to do it and then they would get more involved ?
what happens to a computer factory , what happens when you &apos;re going to go on the stage of the stage ? how the following little manipulation , these tiny little bits of light ?
this is happening in the lab . the little exercise , for just a few minutes , where you can really apply that ? that &apos;s what we &apos;re important to do .
these things . people are kind of showing me the true thing . they show themselves .
she was completely depressed and said , &quot; i don &apos;t have to look for anything . &quot;
they need their bodies , privacy and two minutes , and it can affect the other way in the big way .
so , swimming swimming , to get to your own body , and the other thing that you get to do is to get a ant , and you &apos;re going to go up to the brain , and you drive a blade of grass like a jeep .
and you have to have a kind of a kind of a kind of a design , you have to have an answer .
so it &apos;s like i think richard and i care that these ideas are not being abused .
and of course , they &apos;re extinct in the essence of the way .
but under all these ideas that are going to inevitably spread our technology in the world , many toxic ideas are .
and as viruses should be here , we don &apos;t try to destroy them .
and in my game , it &apos;s called the &quot; you . &quot;
we put some ideas on the legs , we went international on tour .
i know you &apos;ll tell me , &quot; t is not in music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
nobody hears each other . nobody &apos;s familiar with the other .
you &apos;ll see the orchestra in a kind of a grumpy fashion system .
i don &apos;t want to have that that should have happened , but that we need to be better if it &apos;s about answering questions that you have to consider , if you think about the consequences and the reactions .
they work in government government . they &apos;re drivers .
five dollars can save a life .
she deserves about two dollars a day , and she &apos;s just building a computer phone , and she tells me that she &apos;s not going to have married children before these things are done .
finally , from despair , they went and got a wise old woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , if you &apos;re angry , you &apos;ll be the best talk you &apos;re ever going to regret .
okay , the vast majority of us .
his message was basically unity , the connectedness of everything and the unity of everything . and his fundamental value was respect to strangers .
who is fighting while he goes ?
they start to go , in israel and palestine , in jordan , in turkey , in syria .
and so more and more , more and more , it has been a income , and it has been a income for a few times to support your family .
just go to somebody else , with another culture , with another country , with another ethnicity , which is kind of different and engage it in a conversation ; listen to him .
i start there where the story started , 1985 in 1985 .
now , before you &apos;re looking at who &apos;s been the opportunity to get a shower ?
you see here -- 35 percent of these fewer famous houses , where 50,000 indigenous people live , 35 percent of the houses had a functioning shower .
21 percent of what we &apos;re fixing are consequences of the world &apos;s brain , things that were actually wrong around .
we did this . he got a little bit of the time .
we found out later that in this region , failure is the main cause of disease and death .
one thing is , in the context of everything we &apos;ve done , the middle of the world &apos;s brain said , nelson mandela didn &apos;t far from here : &quot; how slavery and apartheid is not intuitive . it &apos;s the work of people , it &apos;s the
i don &apos;t feel that if you call me a little bit of a time . it &apos;s not .
it sounds really a sense of saying that , from here to the top , but if you try to use it , it &apos;s amazing .
and i &apos;m going to take you to this statement , in which you believe that children shouldn &apos;t leave their community to live in a better way .
this is the youngest state of sustainable labor in america with our own financial heritage .
this is a picture of the bronx of the bronx who had kids who were given the children in his house , not in jail so they felt like they felt .
we gave something back .
if you &apos;re big kids with small kids , they &apos;re the big , thick man in the middle , which is cool , and they create these accountability under the surface of the world that is incredibly .
now , you might wonder about these kids .
hold kids away from these stores .
stephen ritz : a teacher who &apos;s the south bronx
secondly , i bet that even you see the difference here as an emerging difference , the difference is a rising line of the light right after that sharp line .
so , to cut 10 : dawn suffered a heart attack .
people with migraine migraine who have an aura , have a band with nervous neurons -- here in red -- that &apos;s three to five millimeters per minute .
the problem is that 30 million americans have migraine migraine , and we need a more powerful thing . i think we have this now .
my first wish is that the most prolific thing for epilepsy , the most prolific , for the most responsible , is a key acronym -- for the treatment of other people &apos;s treatment .
lawyers take cases in the hope of the hope of fat , in the hope of the world , the most poor patients who encourage the poor patients of pity .
a year ago , four of the five of the u.s. scientists were at ushahidi , which is called &quot; the &quot; s &quot; , &quot; the &quot; s &quot; is also called the &quot; &quot; aw . &quot;
how do you know what &apos;s important about that ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i &apos;ve got the first time to get it to this .
these people are calling up the barrier , because they &apos;re going to be really excluded from the process , they know to share the world .
they have to use connexions as a platform to develop their materials and the design of the world , which teach teachers about the world teachers teaching teachers .
yes , books , maybe 100 or 1,000 spending in the year will be sold .
it doesn &apos;t surprise everybody , right ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so that &apos;s not very hard .
the days of the most popular , when people say , &quot; well , we &apos;d like to have three or a half of them in our country to see how this works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a rocket project . it &apos;s an education project .
you can use a couple of thousands of children with two more .
so it &apos;s like a electronic book .
everybody says that &apos;s a $ 100 laptop , you can &apos;t do it .
and that &apos;s the launch .
they click around things and stare at screens . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no . there &apos;s a better way . &quot;
we &apos;re all playing lucy , &quot; i love lucy &quot; on a big line , and we can &apos;t keep out of information .
thank you .
i think most people think that a pregnant mother , whatever your child is getting clean .
that &apos;s not possible . it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s going to be all good . you &apos;ll live .
first , the most popular thing to prevent .
two years ago , one of the mentor mothers came to me and told me a story .
how do you build a better health system ?
the most important thing is , how simple the system is .
if you look at the volume of the gray substance in the age of four to 22 years , it takes the childhood , which shows this graph . it &apos;s the early youth in the early youth .
the idea that your father was singing in the public , she was going to be a little bit of a time .
this is the most important thing we built together .
after the first year , it was invited by the mid-ocean falcon museum in austria to install it in his lobby and i &apos;m happy to say that there was a lot online , 24 hours a day , for almost nine years .
but in the night , while we were looking at the tele-actor , i asked the tele-actor , how the most powerful would have decided that they would kiss sam donaldson .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place where my family has been working for four generations in the u.s.
so , i &apos;m not sure what it has to do with shepherd , but they &apos;re incredibly reactive .
the first thing you see in the most powerful is the terrible force of the brain &apos;s .
he &apos;s just chasing it to my leg , picks me up , bring me up to a vehicle and can bring me to a doctor .
it was a depression in the ground .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about you . &quot;
we have calculated that 200 years of the end of our direct life is the end of our direct life .
it &apos;s so simple , technology as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect , like technology .
it &apos;s the most popular of my favorite .
i &apos;d like to think -- thank you .
and i can assure you : corn is in everything .
you should know that in every community , the number of people who are already growing up is clearly rising .
i led three main classes to antarctica .
but tell me where they are and what country they are . &quot;
we also explored the surface of the islands -- a very important , very important tool for birds , one of the most important things in the pacific .
and we &apos;re as the rest of the world , a problem .
he coined the term &quot; reverse fishing . &quot;
of course , the most open and open lake was the open sea , but the most open sea , which everybody likes to look at was in trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific , with huge amounts of water and huge amounts of water .
now there &apos;s a lot of time , immediate , automatic , automatic , accessible to many of our devices , even on the smartphone .
it &apos;s an endless debate , and there &apos;s no conclusions , no one answer to it , but if you &apos;re a geek like me , you say , &quot; well , what are the data ? &quot;
instead , he &apos;s very carefully documented what happens again when technology is first in a environment and in a community .
so there &apos;s , of course , two different ways .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a yves &apos;s painting .
i mean , that was at least how happy it made me .
now , there was a question of , of course , a question that i &apos;m going to do in the head of a while , well , can i do more of the things that i like to do in design , and less of those who i
and here it is from the front .
they &apos;re a terrible situation without the road .
they &apos;re being manipulated in hospitals .
as a 15-year-old , for example , i was considered extraordinarily talented in the prison of the city , because i knew the most amazing thing about the world , and i know how to use it , and i can work with the most quickly work .
i &apos;ve seen this value of older people in so many of my friends who are in their &apos; 60s , &apos; 70s , &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s , and the &apos; 90s , and the &apos; 90s , and doctors and doctors .
as christian , and made out of the street , and made out of the street of the world , young jewish men in the united states and canada , who also came back to the bible , and canada , who also went back to the bible .
the case of the world &apos;s last muslim europe &apos;s last muslim europe .
the biggest bad man , not , don &apos;t want these rocks to be a little bit of the time , so he &apos;s trying to stop it at the bottom of the day .
and one of my favorites is kiki from yemen .
&quot; and , when does the article come out ? &quot;
so , it &apos;s got to be a little bit of a thing that we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; &#93; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous when a group of themselves identified itself as extremely .
so , the mercy of islam : from islam
let &apos;s look at it .
let me highlight it for you .
let me show you this .
and when i started designing , i &apos;ve discovered something weird about myself .
so they have the eye and then they come to the concepts .
but of course china has a tremendous population .
but what that shows is that this kind of visualization is a form of information , which is a form of the information .
it &apos;s actually a pleasure to engage with you , because they &apos;re visual .
the most popular is named after the eden project in britain .
why don &apos;t it smell like potato or a more or more or more responsible ?
and a theory allows a less to work .
now after a few months of search , i discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule that you call a kind of molecule called a little bit of a molecule .
this is the basis of the device that these two people built from ford .
they made it -- and it &apos;s just like coumarin .
that was a good thing .
and at the time , a series of things are going on to me , and i want to pay attention to you .
and she didn &apos;t really have a clue of the context that she landed .
norman !
i didn &apos;t say goodbye , i didn &apos;t tell my mother , nor my father , my sister , my brother , my brother , my father , my cousins , my grandparents , my grandparents , no .
i reports . i just reports about saying that i had two things when i left the orphanage i wanted to do . that was one , my family and the other was to write poems .
and this is how we look for them .
and then you hope that one of us are running around and little bits of pieces .
he had a computer company , and therefore , he has to be very precise from other female , female and probably smaller family members to reach his age of 12 years .
is this a good evolutionary adaptation or will it lead to the people that are the most pristine way to be the world &apos;s most pristine ?
but will we do that or will we take nature to take their run ?
one day , a few weeks or maybe a year later , i was with my favorite school in a store for a school store , and i wanted to buy a little bit of a design .
this meant a fundamental change for me .
my hint : about 70 layers of this , you can take a little bit of the air .
you know , how obsessed i really am ? this project is just for me , and yet i went so far to buy ebay in a chinese newspaper from san francisco to buy the bird with reasonable ...
when we were to go to the way to the spectacular blue mountains in the west of sydney , it was a perfect computer , sun , the smell of the sound of the sun and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you &apos;re ever going to walk again , just with a little bit of a time . &quot;
i remember my father pushed me out in the wheelchair , and i was up to the bottom , and i felt the first time the sun was on my face .
they said , &quot; we &apos;ll put you next to you , because we think that &apos;s good for you . &quot;
she was going to get me the phone phone and i called the school school , i was going to go and say i &apos;d like to have a book book .
and i said , &quot; aw . &quot;
and mom and dad ? were never up .
i &apos;m in this world , but i &apos;m in a very challenging way .
it &apos;s like a computer designer of the one richard serra .
how to do the hell of hell , i &apos;m going to do a phone in three weeks when i &apos;ve developed these things about millions of years ?
each of these elements could be on the wall as a kind of artistic object .
in his days , he was the highest tax in british .
i look at individual science , and how they flow -- how they stretch and flow . it &apos;s based on furniture , but it &apos;s not the most important thing . it &apos;s been made of aluminum , as opposed to aluminum and it &apos;s grown .
this is the car of the future . it &apos;s a water droplet .
if you think about contemporary architecture , it feels totally natural for me .
this is my studio . it &apos;s underground .
it was made from kevlar .
and i had the same after i had done my dr. , i was lucky to be member of a computer member that used to take him to the first time to explore the ocean .
there was one of these most amazing things .
he uses red bioluminescence like a plastic ball of a car , and it &apos;s a little bit of a sudden to be blind to animals , and can see it without being seen .
so they use it to eat and find partners .
i urge you to call a different science that &apos;s still used hundreds of years old technology .
this is a magical place .
so i made myself rediscover the value of sleep .
and on june fifth , i heard a loud bang on the disk , which changed my life and ended up a duck .
and here &apos;s the duck again .
after the price , my life changed .
another example of the impact of the brain &apos;s life on the life of birds .
so , if i do something like this -- this is the sound for purple .
depending on how i &apos;m going to hear it , i can hear music with the food and write .
one of them is &quot; i have a dream of martin luther king , and the other is from hitler .
now , you can see more and more often , that former general is now the most powerful .
you don &apos;t want to say anything about it , which could be used against a . &quot;
absolutely crucial .
and what happens when teachers want to get order ?
and why not ? they don &apos;t trust the law . why don &apos;t they trust the law ?
because it &apos;s that freedom has a structure of a structure .
because life is complex . and here &apos;s the hardest and largest change : we need to have the authority for the interpretation and application of law and shoots .
a free society needs red and green lights , otherwise it &apos;s going to be very crowded .
and the limits for interest , the most important , can calculate the way that they can take .
well , if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard to get out of columns with a ruler .
he had a very bad job .
he had only a single one of the last .
but the problem , on rules and incentives , is that they &apos;re going to be constrained by the professional activity , and they demoralize the professional activity in two ways .
so smart , more than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that any wise color of this can be upright for unlimited time .
why has this idea spread ?
people want to be more inclusive .
it was an extraordinary time . i &apos;m going to be a little bit more visible to the mentality that we -- america and the rest of the world -- at the time .
this was a little bit of the turtle , the turtle .
we have a full of the whole thing to do with this .
what i want to show you is what you needed to transport 34 pounds up to the spread of uranium .
what would have been if you had nuclear weapons ?
we come down and bring the trucks that you just saw somewhere in the back of here .
part of the problem is that the most important self , the most overwhelmed self , are a nuclear disaster .
it was sent to me from somebody who &apos;s a computer company who &apos;s a computer company , and the fact is that america had hard .
there are many black sheep out there that are doing the wrong things , and the problems have even swum .
we can show our results . we can make things better .
how can we tap them ?
it &apos;s a dangerous working environment to have a dangerous working environment .
imagine , we could , because if we could , we could achieve more .
governments who are doing most of the progress are the governments who have found ways to allow , shared value in business , rather than seeing the government that &apos;s the unique one .
maybe i can cut this up , and i can see the brain , and i can change my cut .
i want to zoom in .
come on with me a moment to the 19th century , and it &apos;s a very precisely at june b.c.
we could certainly be so productive if facebook or twitter wouldn &apos;t cost us so much time .
they look down to the british government to get money for building babbage &apos;s machines , because they believed that these machines would have tremendous practical effects for society .
these benefits didn &apos;t just have less wealthy men who were doing research , but they also upset the research of the world , rather than answering the only question of the question .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i learned something about life .
once you start looking at the very small stuff -- this person wrote a whole article , and said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and all of those not old enough , they don &apos;t have any idea how this infection happened -- which is through this episode .
there are about 10,000 programs of this .
this would be the frequency of the way that you can find the 26 letters of the ideal in one of the randomly chosen monkeys .
wherever life is , you will have these distribution , unlike this distribution .
too hot .
the cop says , &quot; are you sure ? hey , you &apos;re sure you &apos;ve lost the one here ? &quot;
these are the data of a single survey to the most successful district in zambia , from a few years ago , where i have a few years ago .
as you see , bruce willis had a lot more hair at the time .
you could talk about 10,000 , 20,000 or 30,000 dollars if i had the time or it was in my plan , and i didn &apos;t just have a vacation .
instead of teaching people how to put the forms on the cell phones , we should develop software that allows them to do the self without practice and without my favorite .
this is less than i did when i went to a couple of weeks when i was a consultant .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , in life or in the balloon , we have to change the height .
this can be in the spirituality .
and that &apos;s why they need weather .
i promised myself that i would take the next time i would fly around the world , not take fuel , regardless of fossil fuels to be safe , not to be threatened by the most prolific .
i think you need a pilot in the airplane that can talk to the universities , who can talk to students , with politicians during the flight of the flight , and it can really make a human adventure .
and what &apos;s the goal ?
this is why all people who believe in this spirit mind are welcome to being part of this team .
now you just need one laptop .
anyway , for us , africa was a magical place .
the next thing i want to make clarity is what this problem is and what it is .
that &apos;s crazy , really , if you think about it .
let &apos;s stop with a second with the nonsense .
the fact is that we can see the first generation , and this extreme poverty can see the eyes , you see it , and you can tell it . it &apos;s not to stand .
it &apos;s a nerves .
this year is a test for us , especially for the leaders of the g8 states , who are starting and the world &apos;s history .
people are starting to find that slowly .
and with this one campaign as our chute , my organization , data , and other groups that the energy and the enthusiasm of there are out of hollywood to the north of america .
step forward , you go forward , a nurse , a teacher , a a tedster , and life will be saved .
the idea that the internet , which has changed all their lives , can change a country -- and a continent of it just made to analog , let me get the head out of the head .
lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
now , your job is to recognize what this shapes is , and what kiki .
now , if you &apos;re not just a little bit more comfortable , this sentence , literally , is just wrong .
if we solve a problem or something new , we compare that to what we already know about , what &apos;s unknown to us .
nadia al-sakkaf : i &apos;m happy to be here .
they don &apos;t fit to all these representations .
pm : i don &apos;t think that .
how do they handle them , but they also have their own , but with their own business ?
some of my reporters are arrested .
so , this shows a different picture of yemen .
my heart was three times big .
this is a list of side effects : if you eat too much salt like a car , like a more salt and a sandwich sandwich , you probably land on intensive care .
but soon i showed symptoms for the computer , and i had to go back to the street , knowing that i probably never would see my home .
i was sitting there , and i talked little little about the computer bank for the transplants and asked him what i needed when i needed a transplant , to prepare me .
i was on a dozen machines that kept me alive .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these is also one of these most popular things in the united states , and it &apos;s about 200 percent .
and also , interesting is that the same business that sold us to 80 million pounds of atrazine , the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; -- &quot; and the antidote to the same company .
we also launched as a business model .
what would our health care to us to tell us when you go back to a day , and i had a little bit of a little bit of a sudden , some artificial , some artificial a. and a little bit of a plastic a.
the problem is that in my village , oakland , in most of our villages , that connection is not going to be .
here &apos;s the accumulation of the board of the screen &apos;s national park next to the airport of los angeles .
i offered five cents for every single time .
the most powerful can &apos;t be contained , it &apos;s become global .
here you see , in red , the spread of the ocean .
they &apos;re like a mouse watching the foot of an elephant , and the largest part of them remain hidden .
they look out of their tree tree and they come from all directions around us .
redwoods have tremendous surface that &apos;s expanding in the sky , because they tend to be something called the &quot; -- repetition . &quot;
the redwood tree is giving the redwood stability , just like a cathedral , and help the tree , longer to live .
it &apos;s absolutely a very reactive thing to see .
but for recently , all doors of the palace are open and break the walls .
this was 25 years ago .
so let &apos;s start looking at the first time for example .
how do these people do with these infected computers ?
and you can afford to watch how we work -- how security works -- and try to find a way to find the most powerful , the way we meet .
you &apos;ll notice that you can see there &apos;s a little bit down there : the d / d / d and if you open this image image on your computer , this program is downloaded and picked up .
and if you look at the images of the scene , you can see that the hallmark of the ipcc is the kind of the ipcc .
we have to find any way to make sure that everything is playing , even though the computer is falling .
but i don &apos;t have to do anything .
this person is around with consultants .
why should we believe what he says ? &quot;
how does his future look like ?
this powers completely disappear , no one &apos;s going to do that 2011 .
it would be good if people were more sensitive , and they would take this kind of calculation seriously and participate in this , because this would change things . but it would change things on two more and two ways .
that means that we can see a copy of ourselves , when you just use one part of the most powerful , that in slow motion , and a worse , and more powerful , and a more powerful thing .
and the happy few , jill and kevin ? well , they came back from their favorite , and they saw that their video had suddenly spread as a football machine .
thank you .
you &apos;re going to go to the distance .
this is what he taught him to do since he was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had a mentor like mau , who taught me how to dedicate .
what is it that &apos;s going to drive you in life today ? not 10 years ago .
what do you do with what you &apos;re doing and you do it ?
didn &apos;t have the -- time . didn &apos;t have the -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager . didn &apos;t ...
in this moment , aware or unconscious . right now , in the moment you decide to focus on something , you can make a meaning , and whatever it means , it makes feelings .
have you ever done what , and then you &apos;ve got to go , &quot; that was me ! &quot;
to death , so , god in his infinite wisdom , gave us another human need : the uncertainty .
but this is true : we need it . we can do it through intimacy , through friendship , through prayers , through the motion of nature .
and there are seven different beliefs . i can &apos;t go through it , because i &apos;m through . the last element is feeling .
jewish man with family in occupied territory , someone in new york , who died if he had been working on the day , and this man who wanted to be a terrorist and he said it quite clearly .
instead , i &apos;m interested in developing tools with which one big number of people can tell their stories , people everywhere in the world .
the color of the particles is the kind of feeling of feeling -- happy , positive feelings have shining colors .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was the whole day on the computer . &quot;
and when i go over here , the list starts to walk , and there are thousands of feelings that were collected .
the 10 themes of rays and circle of the time .
it &apos;s called &quot; universe : unveiling of our modern mythology . &quot;
we can click this and see this iconic image of betty ford , like her husband &apos;s passage .
you can also look at quotes when you want to read quotes to climate change .
so people feel clouds as something that is in the way .
in life , they started to have tens of thousands of members in almost 100 countries in the entire world .
they just need one step out to go outside , and to notice that so usual , so that &apos;s so common , so that all other people are missing .
so look up , admire the positive beauty , and think of it always to wear the head in the clouds .
they would have 25,000 pictures that would have been made , &quot; the good , good , good .
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the most popular , to buy my first ted team . it was a huge machine .
these images came from a virtual autopsy .
you can see here , the knife is being hacked in the heart .
it &apos;s a little , mechanical pen , which has built in its inner , very fast motors .
now , this is a really interesting project .
so he does .
so , very talented people .
i went to the kids so often as possible to get the academic stuff with the real world in connection .
it &apos;s not all , but it &apos;s an incredibly empowering summary of everything we know about the foundations of nature .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details , why we think the universe is so , but it &apos;s made of mathematics and trying to explain the physics that we know .
but in my career , i always put something in my career .
in 2001 , i visited her during a prison shop .
we got a lot of training .
this is the first degree of the first degree in 2004 .
he &apos;s a little bit of the time before the ted age , and it was recently filmed with someone that you all know .
each one is a student , but in different scientific disciplines , it &apos;s specialized .
i have my first computer as a teenager in accra , and it was a really great device .
he explores the brain using mri and he says this is the most beautiful brain he ever had .
so the next few slides i &apos;m going to tell you about this .
transistors are going to be smaller to allow and that has made our technology better .
our main system is behind this lens .
i had such a gut feeling that we &apos;re wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so we know what a radius is .
i like to call them the most powerful of the world &apos;s favorite , because they &apos;re kind of kind of like a little bit of a time .
we can see more detail in our galaxy than somewhere else .
and that brings us a factor of 20th .
so there was a bunch of alternatives to the notion that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff there .
it &apos;s a lot more powerful than the other and the cloud is taken apart .
and i hope i &apos;ve convinced you at least that we have a really supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy .
one day i was in the streets of new york , and i saw some kids between stairs , cars and fire .
so for example , people in the 11th liked pieces of pieces that ended up so .
in the first eight centuries of this tradition , the great &quot; what &quot; in the world , &quot; what &quot; in the first eight centuries , &quot; to appreciate .
through new and improved instruments , the age of the disagreement broke .
but one question is : what happens when the music stops ?
michael paravicini thomas : music and feelings in time
so we &apos;re at the beginning of a new computer system .
until 1945 , they brought it on 100,000 years .
so i &apos;m going to talk about the world &apos;s sake , although i don &apos;t know where to start .
wow , a volunteer , great !
but recently , my interest was inspired by a new view of big amounts of time , because there are conditions where these things can really make a cool thing .
well , i think this is the latest development of a phenomenon that we call &quot; sympathetic innovation . &quot;
but the element of desire is really the most important thing .
we get amazing talks from them .
let me introduce you to this point sam .
but even if you &apos;re going to get the screen back , there &apos;s a lot more than just words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
how do global innovation promote innovation .
first , i have to make a service of the audience , and from the talk , what i &apos;m going to give him , instead of saying , what i &apos;m not going to offer .
and that they &apos;re fun to design their own ultimate or worst tedtalk .
well , you can &apos;t compare them to each other .
they hold them alive and give them the sugar , so a kind of a kind of kind of a kind of a kind of a design that we call the superpower .
this kind of testing is going to be used , ok ?
somebody asked , &quot; why ? &quot;
and he thought he could reverse the waves . couldn &apos;t it .
i think there are three big changes , and in the areas transparency , choice and accountability , where people have a real power .
how do we do that ?
my favorite , sharon , and sharon , said , all over the world , more photos of their head as from each other .
11 of 14 countries .
and secondly , teachers were looking at the most sophisticated and the methods of being helpful , because they took in specific areas of the way that they were a sense of a sense of faith .
so i wish all of a nice weekend .
dna to read and write , always become easier and cheaper .
the canadian work alone .
now you might ask yourself , &quot; what would i do in a museum ? &quot;
if you have all the world &apos;s world , this can lead to a solar system , who allows you to do biotechnology .
the kingdom says , his laws allow him to be , strangers , or a risk of economic risk , or a risk of health or a risk of health or the values of the state .
these laws are a blow into the face for science and based on prejudice and ignorance and a sustainable rule of traditions and a selective settlement .
why are you going to be pregnant if you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of the 10 hundred thousand people who inject drugs .
so that social worker , the condoms that are transmitted condoms to endangered people , are not being tracked by the police , or they &apos;re being locked in or randomly locked up .
here were kids born , people died there .
office for personal work are already obsolete .
they &apos;ve gone up the high line , the road , the river , the river below the street , and you get from a end to the other , without crossing the most , without crossing the most , without crossing the water .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny apartments . &quot;
also , jobs should be shared .
their liver is able to make oil .
and they killed about 12,000 sharks at the time , by actually just putting a laser of the most prolific in the bay bay bay island .
we know very little about them .
so this tag is going to find the place of a shark , depending on time and the sunset , the water and depth .
let &apos;s look at the throughput of the time , which is what we &apos;re going to do with the genes that are passed from parents , then we see that basking sharks , compared to the first study , have a factor of 10 times more diverse than
so , this research , and this research , and found that the size of the 9,000 is .
and what was okay . we got wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build . &quot;
so if we can tell the gender of the shark before we take a sample , we can say , if you were a male or female .
so i decided to give myself the merchants .
their bodies are broken up with the water , and they &apos;re determined to be used for any of the food companies to make money -- people tell themselves many such stories .
no business with no one .
my journalism may not fit in other continents or in other countries , but in my part of africa , but it &apos;s working on corruption , asking people , &quot; where are the evidence ?
aa thank you .
i was raised in downtown manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks away from the radio coast of the world &apos;s apartment .
i wouldn &apos;t read as a designer .
and had these people ever realized a victim of their favorite ?
today , you can be in 29 states , in more than half of the country , because of its sexuality .
and at some point i realized that my mission &quot; gay &quot; was to photograph in the wrong , because there was a million different types of gay technology .
at least i hope that it &apos;s going to be harder to get your human rights .
first , the world is , and it &apos;s always going to contain good and evil , because good and evil , yin and yang are the most powerful .
and third , i had access to all 1,000 pictures that had made the soldiers .
in three ways , the conventional way is called the world &apos;s face .
this is stanley milgram , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he said , &quot; could the holocaust happen , here and now ? &quot;
&quot; my lord , who is responsible if he &apos;s going to happen ? &quot;
stanley tarter and i closed both 1954 , the high school , at the james ridge in the bronx .
here &apos;s the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
the other thing . the self &apos;s self .
alexander &apos;s name says that the border between good and evil through the heart of any human being .
and i put this experiment on the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what everybody could do , &quot; no big thing to jump on the tracks .
it &apos;s a mystery that really was very difficult to teach .
we have a self .
but on my left retina , a computer &apos;s is a very , very clear thing that &apos;s going through the red arrow .
there &apos;s just a reference point , which is the body .
i promise i don &apos;t say anything to you except that it &apos;s supposed to be scary .
and the autobiographical self has extended memory , thinking , imagination , creativity and language .
thank you . thank you for the $ drunk -- and the fiddler hill .
now i &apos;m telling you this -- i &apos;m telling you , and i &apos;m just making it ridiculous , because i think feminism has partly the task , admit , the aesthetics , and beauty and fun .
we don &apos;t want a hero .
you can now see , i didn &apos;t put myself in fire .
she talked about the design of the , she started to play her , she organized her , she &apos;s making friends -- all these everyday acts of care and creativity .
i mean that it &apos;s this perception that is different from the homo sapiens of former .
in fact , this is a sensor for brainwaves that reads the electric activity in my brain while i think this talk is .
we &apos;re making a lot of prototypes and products to live with thoughts that you can control with thoughts , like thought-controlled appliances , or a floating chair .
the headset is wireless with a ipad or smartphone .
how these kids can use their new consciousness to their recovery , a lot of the harmful and more powerful social media projects are turning around , which people are diagnosed with as different , to see themselves .
they understood the power of human narrative and that the value we &apos;re going to change on people , changes , change , growing and growing .
and said , &quot; how are you going to celebrate ? &quot;
my skills and my possibilities .
temporary , and it was , in fact , unexpected .
this specialist didn &apos;t mean to look at my eyes .
i went to a track that i know good .
and it &apos;s very , very slow .
i didn &apos;t really believe in my own , not really , not all of the stocks of me , all of us .
that &apos;s me . my whole thing .
what we have is exactly the same thing , the same activity , but at one of them , they feel great , and in the other , with just a small change in the posture , they feel terrible .
but i think it &apos;s a different debate that needs to take place to control the scale of control , which we have about our tax tax .
for the most appropriate percent of this money , you could have put in the trains in the trains , which would not have reduced the duration of the journey , but what the pleasure and the usefulness of the usefulness would have improved .
i &apos;m not asking for the full of the whole one of the other .
sometimes the lines are very , very long .
i think the danger in the world today is that the field of economics is understood as a human psychology to human psychology .
the average answer to 50 to 60 percent would have been .
it will be a little bit of the time that they don &apos;t even hurt themselves , other people .
yay !
they &apos;re 20 , 30 years back .
but that would not mean that i have a coin with a head on both sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but this is our skin of the visible universe .
thank you .
with hyperscore , we had good , really strong effects in children around the world , and now in humans every age .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful , who wants to live forever .
hello . my name is dan &apos;s . i &apos;m 34 years old , and i have cerebral cerebral cerebral .
this is actually the score of dan &apos;s piece that he &apos;s completely composed in hyperscore .
odysseus said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do a nuclear prize .
there &apos;s a present self .
i have to write five pages a day for articles , or i had to give five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that this is going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you is the last time that i &apos;m going to show you , the last time i &apos;ve done with hal , which i &apos;ve been doing with hal &apos;s , who was introduced to me from my co-author at a
it &apos;s pretty good that it &apos;s not about the people affected , because if one of the faces smile , the other face is paralyzed .
this is one of the reasons that so much of what we think of western science , math and engineering , actually in the first few centuries of our food system , has been developed by the most successful , and we &apos;ve developed the most powerful .
x is the unknown , because there &apos;s no sh in the spanish .
so it &apos;s not that if you &apos;re talking about mental illness , you probably have stories of the most powerful suffering , shame and discrimination in almost all the life systems .
something more than 30 years ago , the nations in the world were formed in the world in the world , and they gave this legendary explanation .
what is it about ?
if you look at the level of species , you &apos;ve heard about fish .
and you look at these profits , you see that almost 8,000 of these dollars are actually subsidies .
that was in the early croton , when india wanted to be a nuclear power , and as a means to the recovery -- to china , to china , to the end of eight , nine , 10 percent and asked himself , why can &apos;t we ?
it &apos;s not a happy situation , but they have the trust and the courage , and the courage to say , &quot; we have computing .
green carbon , so the emissions through deforestation and agriculture , and blue carbon together , together , are 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it to win .
i didn &apos;t know what these things mean , dick , not -- sydney , by the way .
i also liked these intellectual folk practices .
and he said he had basically had the same relationship to his father .
there was a theory .
he did it again .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t move in the course of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed the whole thing , and the color color , which is just hidden , which is just a fantastic aluminum shell .
many of these ideas are produced in the trailer for airstream .
if you think about it , your children to send the tinkering school , you &apos;ll come back with a little bit of time , and you &apos;ll come back to the ground .
but let &apos;s play it under your own conditions , and trust me , you &apos;ll learn things that you can &apos;t learn from the most of the time of the world &apos;s brain .
if you want to throw a device next to you , you don &apos;t do it .
i think that &apos;s all . this is number five . okay .
so here you see the sick knee on the left , and here my wife at the walk today , four months after , in aspen , and in good constitution .
how about a completely valid , not just the sharing ?
this is one of the seven times more existing , which is not been shot in all the way .
and so , in the years of buying western europe , western europe started to buy thousands , then hundreds of thousands and thousands of individuals , and then to print millions of individuals , which should be put in the sky in the sky .
but how does our imagination work ?
but we never think about the hidden connections .
as edison the light bulb invented , she looked like this .
you have to be right , and even though i don &apos;t have a college college , it doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m stupid , because you can &apos;t be stupid today , and it &apos;s going to bring it far in the world .
they literally have the door of the door .
if you listen to the most prolific listening to your favorite , both ears are both both speakers .
we have the problem that the antenna is vibrating .
thank you very much .
and i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and i &apos;m interested in systems .
recently , i &apos;ve created some pretty sophisticated folk projects from the gapminder &apos;s alibi .
and i drew her own special card , and i wrote her name on it , and she was writing her name , and she sent them .
i &apos;m sure i can see how you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a time .
and i believe that it &apos;s a lot of time , my valuable and limited life on this earth is just about the same thing .
in this mode , he tries to hold his position .
i thought i &apos;m a little bit of a bit of how nature creates materials .
we &apos;re thinking about future technologies . we start in the beginning of the world .
and if you look at it , you see the amino acids with the plastic sensors that you have different charges .
and by a series of a series of a billion fish , you can get one billion fish , which is what you want to do , like a battery or a solar cell .
in this case , you see the water coming out .
if you ask people the question : where do you go to do something important ?
i sat on my desk , i &apos;ve used my expensive computer .
what happens -- sometimes you have these days , you wake up at eight o &apos;clock in the morning , or to seven or when you &apos;re up , and you say , &quot; man , i don &apos;t have good sleep .
in the office , most of the interruptions and distractions that people actually keep from work , are participants .
we all know that this is true . they would never experience a spontaneous meeting that employees will be done .
so meetings and managers are now the two main problems in companies , especially in offices .
maybe every two weeks , or every week , once the week , the week , no one can talk to you .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m going to do this now seven years and have no idea how the future will look .
but if you ask people to ask the three important things they &apos;re wearing , whatever culture , which is gender and what context -- most people say , keys , money , and if you own one , the mobile phone .
but , and this is a very big but , we have the tendency to forget .
now , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
they take 10 or 20 percent of the car , and then the owner of the store takes 10 or 20 percent of the car , and there &apos;s the rest of the bar on my family .
it challenges the norm .
and he kind of has a recognition of the values of rotating .
at the same time , with the spread of these mobile devices , we see an expectation of availability .
our current reality is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell later about .
what are we talking about ?
dean ornish shares new research studies that show how the verbal industries can affect a human level of genetic lifestyles , and he says , if we live healthier , better food , exercise and love , our brain cells actually replicate .
until i tell you who said it .
within this context , we can obviously feel regret about many different things .
when i went home , after i got my tattoo , i stayed almost the night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s another fifth .
i mean , even the dumb answer to all of us can let us back to a few days .
and as i said , i &apos;m a computer maker .
i thought i would try to try to do my ted wish to try and get what i &apos;m trying to do , and how this fits to what they &apos;re trying to do .
no one in india . now there &apos;s at least half a million active .
and i came to think that someone in this whole non-governmental world have to think about the organization of the world &apos;s organization .
and so we did that to do that .
listen to this : less than four tenth of one percent of those who were treated , the practice of their drugs , or the way they were , are their treatment , or their treatment .
it &apos;s a try and i think it would be successful .
the desks are not square .
when the shack is used , it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity , day and night .
and people are bringing their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , with green school .
the local women from bali cooking food on the ground and they use secrets that only know their grandmothers .
we need somebody who comes and studied it .
the green school is a model that we built for the world .
my tongue , voice and vocal vocal , were still healthy and not dead . &quot;
then apple got alex , the best voice i &apos;ve heard .
there was one reason for that : that was me .
the most important thing is not of course .
but that &apos;s not what it is .
at first , the internet was a computer tool for me , and now it &apos;s something that i &apos;m going to leave for my real , daily life .
it &apos;s human to ignore disease .
they all know the test for artificial intelligence , the turing test .
i was an architect before , and my grandmother asked me , &quot; what do you live ? &quot;
we treated two main pages as a single side , because it &apos;s the only one that &apos;s going to take the readers .
so what is the lesson behind ?
but one day , my grandmother said , &quot; no , this time you &apos;re going to walk .
it &apos;s happened and terrible things happened with me .
all of the hope in my healing .
so they went to their own , and they all collected their own furniture furniture -- they gave me pots and whatnot , and they were doing everything .
you don &apos;t know how far away this road is , and you don &apos;t know if you go straight and you hear cars go and you &apos;ve got a terrible accident , and they had a terrible accident that they put in this situation .
i thought that for some reason , the time was left and only for family and friends .
for example , the understanding of molecular structures .
he took me to the most of the time of the street .
can we say we &apos;ve all discovered symmetries of the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t turn it down because i &apos;ve built a little bit of a barrier , right ?
if i rotate a magic train , and then one , it makes a third .
galois has set up a series of laws for how these tables , these symmetries , interact .
so , one of these symmetry is called the &quot; test . &quot;
instead of all , all the mess , i want to know how many digits have the number . ok ?
i need your name . symmetrical objects , basically -- please spell it for me .
first , worse diet , maybe shorter , more likely .
thomas edison had a software company in a software company today .
penicillin was discovered in 1946 , but even in 1940 , no commercial and medical useful amounts of it .
it was the origin of the world &apos;s day , the last year his 50th birthday .
for me , the lesson of unintended consequences is that chaos is now happening . let &apos;s do the best thing .
it works with every computer and browser , minus , minus , minus , and the text is getting smaller .
they don &apos;t need to delete them either .
and so , a kind of information that i &apos;m inspired by , my real desk .
a means that it would be like a more powerful , so you get more traditional desktop , and the things are on grid .
now i get to my music , and there &apos;s no boundaries of people , and there &apos;s no boundaries .
but i think the point is , it &apos;s metaphor with a bite , and with such a bite , i want to suggest that we &apos;re going to rethink the role of contemporary mathematics a little bit -- not just the math , but math in general .
and he said , &quot; well , there are 2,000 physicists today on wall street and i &apos;m one of them . &quot;
you can find them here : this is a book about flies that you might have on amazon .
these are not the most important ; that &apos;s culture .
you can do it very , very far .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s actually so interesting .
go . shake . louder !
i want to tell you a secret .
so , intersections without traffic lights , so with stop , save many lives , but there &apos;s a heat amount of money .
the answer is to allow cars to come from this side of the street .
warren buffet had suggested this : honestly to say what works and what &apos;s not going to do and make this a annual thing .
in fact , we see the genetic code that it &apos;s the only known disease because of the living people in africa , even a few things have been formed to avoid the most important thing .
this means that the economy in these areas are being avoided , because it &apos;s just so much stopping .
but there &apos;s no way that we have a more inclusive .
not only was she weak ; she &apos;s getting weaker .
a teacher of the top neighborhood will be the performance of his class -- measured in a year for 10 percent .
but it &apos;s not a relationship to being a better teacher .
&quot; what &apos;s going on here ? &quot;
and these free courses could not only be available in the internet , but you can also make dvds everywhere , so everyone with access to a very promising teacher can have the best teachers .
traditional vessels , like this cup , need eight to 10 hours to burn .
the sculptor richard serra talks about how he thought as a young artist , he was a painter and he lived in florence .
when i look at these photos , i &apos;m going to go back to the smoke , and i went home to my clothes when i went home at my family .
my parents were great . they said , &quot; we know you &apos;re afraid , but let &apos;s just go tomorrow .
but is it so bad to keep us for so powerful ?
this is a general general general in boston .
the bonus is taking the sample , it &apos;s a , it &apos;s a , it &apos;s a , it &apos;s a little bit of the microscope , and then it &apos;s informed the operating room .
so in this process , a solution to these bracelets , with a dye , with a dye , shown green , is actually being able to be able to be able to put in the brain cells of a cancer patient , can &apos;t separate normal tissue .
with a little bit of our lymph nodes as part of our current , the surgeon &apos;s surgeon is looking for the individual node , the lymph node , where cancer begins .
if nerves are damaged , they can cause the spinal cord , and pain .
if we &apos;re going to get these two samples of dna ...
we know that this is doable and we &apos;re determined to realize this .
and this cell is one of the thousands of different types of dna that we learn .
it &apos;s going to affect the healthy circuits as the sick , which you want to fix .
and one morning in 2004 , we tried it and it &apos;s been working on the first time .
we &apos;ve shown that already a short index of these cells is enough to make learning .
and it &apos;s going . now .
i want to end with a story that we believe might be clinical application .
now you can see that the animal actually goes into the walls and can use the little platform and use his eyes again .
buildings are a heterosexual microbes in the air , and they &apos;re in the air , and they &apos;re in the air , and over mechanical , and mechanical .
and if you &apos;re out there , the air contains microbes that are associated with the general and dirt .
obviously , i &apos;m a physical person , as you see , so i had no worry , this thing , 20 blocks far .
the same thing for the question , who after 9 / 11 was the streets of my neighborhood ?
and you can get a list .
one of these things i &apos;ve been experimenting with is something called google share , basically you just take a abstract term and look at google after that , and then you look at this data in the results of someone .
this is britney spears . i mean , ok , interesting .
if you have the second side here , most of you link .
what was normal for us 40 years ago -- that &apos;s what stories tell us about generations -- is now rare .
in 1939 , the film is older than most of our members of our members .
was the story good to tell ?
why don &apos;t we see that with the same passion as reading ?
in california , they &apos;re going to send them to a deceptive twist : &quot; this product contains chemicals that are the state of california as a cause of cancer , and the other thing that &apos;s seen from cancer . &quot;
so maybe we could develop a more sophisticated , humility , and for my profession as an architect , it &apos;s a bad thing that the words &quot; humility &quot; and &quot; architect &quot; since &quot; the eternal source &quot; were not mentioned in the same paragraph .
i don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was , &quot; the stone stone didn &apos;t end , because we &apos;re running the stones . &quot;
and that can be very well for berlin , but we did it in houston , and all the windows are closed . and with all the products that obviously didn &apos;t have been designed for using the use of air , that &apos;s actually a vertical of the
if we look at the word competition , i &apos;m sure most of you use it .
since we &apos;ve been able to put 4,000 at the most common , most common , most common , we &apos;ve been able to put in a database of the public .
now we have 160 pounds of heavy life companies learning the internet in the internet .
we started commercial and mixed use of buildings so that all people and places have the centers of the centers , where they can stop .
and this is the most salient thing in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . let &apos;s tell you that we knew that we knew that all of us , because we didn &apos;t know .
for example , they give that the most important thing in microsoft started at 9 / 11 , at yahoo , 2008 , in march 2008 , and then the other one : google , facebook , skype and so on .
i chose sweden because sweden has similar laws , like the united states .
and who also tells you , he didn &apos;t have to hide it for a long time .
their email were read and they talked to the most in the prison and said , &quot; if there &apos;s no right on privacy , there can &apos;t be any more freedom of freedom , and therefore no effective democracy can be . &quot;
many people , if you see a fresh human brain , say , &quot; usually it looks different if you get a brain . &quot;
all these empty areas , the areas that are coming through the lines .
and the nature of a particular cell , to basically be able to make a difference , is that it &apos;s turned on the 25,000 genes , and what threshold they are turned on .
now experts come to play and make basic anatomical populations .
we take the material , and we put it on a so-called called a &quot; the design system . &quot;
so what can scientists learn from this data ?
they look at their entire genomes and they try to find the most powerful , which are linked to the genes .
whether that &apos;s the individual genetic background or your experience , we don &apos;t know .
that we know how to eradicate poverty , we just need to do more for it ?
so here &apos;s a couple more questions .
how do you know ?
so what is the problem ?
well , before it was all the same .
and it was made a lot of experiments that all came to the same outcome , so i &apos;m just going to tell you about one .
so what is the best ?
we need this kind of information . we need more of it , and we need to drive the politics .
and maybe we &apos;re going to start small with things where we &apos;re sure they &apos;re working .
poverty is more irrelevant than scientific work , and a lack of data about the effects of the impact of the brain , the question of how to get this is the way that we can do this . but esther esther duflo means that it &apos;s possible to
so we start , because africa is in a certain way , in the field of the ocean .
and the legend reported that alexander was walking through this desert .
but you could say , &quot; invest in africa with 1,000 languages , and it would not move . &quot;
so let &apos;s look at the countries , and the specific materials and data .
i want to talk to you about the human capital of the capital .
in tanzania , last week of the standard of the standard , the standard was called the standard of the standard .
if i had to ask them , &quot; what was the world &apos;s best performance in 2005 ? &quot; would you think of egypt ?
because there &apos;s amazing opportunities .
&quot; god &quot; is the journey we all want to be inspired to be inspired and feel with the universe , which celebrate life .
you &apos;re going to get a switch -- there &apos;s electric light .
i don &apos;t know why , but they thought .
i &apos;m going to leave that to you , so you can sort of take that kind of thing and i &apos;ll describe my response to the first time i &apos;ve seen that .
right .
ok , move , raise your right hand .
kt : yeah .
kt : no , no . i just see the street .
i couldn &apos;t see through the blindfold .
again , again .
kb : how often did you feel that ?
let &apos;s close your eyes , in five , four , three , one .
just if you want the pressure released , you make a more powerful , so , but only if you want the pressure down .
do you want to try it ?
you feel a certain sense of emotion , and if you feel the emotion , i want you to throw the bottle of the bottle into the bottle .
there &apos;s one thing that i want to share with you .
ready ?
my hand is , here , in the way , in the blink of the city .
kb : ok . do you think he &apos;s here , yes or no ?
first of all , keith barry , how our brain can be able to make our bodies -- with a trick , also working with a trick of the brain , and then he &apos;s going to be able to put the audience into some amazing moves of brain
i &apos;m going to be embarrassed .
this is not for the one of four . this is for all four .
i watched that both religious people are equally obsessed with morality .
the most powerful is almost zero when there &apos;s no stimulation to make it possible .
and then you get the message from the computer : &quot; person one has sent them to this amount of money .
we showed that the gift of oxytocin is increasing generosity to the 80 percent of the time .
i &apos;ve just found the molecule .
he asked me , &quot; what should we do ? &quot;
we have a lot of testosterone with experiments .
and that tells us that we invented this ritual to connect us with this new couple of emotionally .
and it &apos;s very easy to encourage a brain to be able to encourage the brain .
to get the device to run , you need a lot of people .
or should you not do that ?

from him , the sound comes from the chamber .
or we do this , and we think that &apos;s what blindness is .
rain . not bad . not bad .
and so , individual deals . but why can &apos;t i do that if i learn a piece of music ?
in this case , the dove of the dove shows the dove of evelyn evelyn glennie , why the music is a lot more than sound waves on his eardrum .
and it became so big , until the point where it was a very last year at cornell , and rick &apos;s thanksgiving , and rick gibson &apos;s million people in television .

listen to the focus of these online spots , where you failed to have a failed , if you need four hours .
in the math process , it was always about interacting with things , not with people -- not with a social way of being able to accept the people who would really help us accept robots as part of our everyday life .
cookie monster is very , very bad .
the remote remote was a experimenter from our group , where they used three of three different technologies to interact with the participants .
and with this technology , you can become the active participants in life in their grandchildren , in a way that it &apos;s not possible today .
and the third way was a simple journal with paper and pen , because that &apos;s the most important thing you used to use when you start a design program and a program .
another important idea is this idea of the computer &apos;s brain &apos;s idea of the character .
i have style , laughing , really hard , because it &apos;s not a drum , it &apos;s not going to be a little bit of a drum , but it &apos;s going to be a little bit of the n .

autism has a very large range of very massive -- the child doesn &apos;t develop language -- until the brilliant scientists and engineers .
i love the film , like all of my projects , and that &apos;s the mainframe balls in me .

each of you can do changes and you can do it to the other of the work , even if you knew nothing about the existence of each other before .
this is called a &quot; the &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; the right thing , &quot; this thing right here .
something significant that can happen to a culture is that you can acquire a new kind of energy , you know , you can get a new type of energy , you know , it &apos;s a new , you know , right ?

and that would be bad .
we &apos;re in the way we &apos;re talking to the next rover , which we want to send to mars .
and i know many of you have been in the last time that these are really cool things .
there were two satellites that are particularly interested in us .

today i want to talk about how this exponential technologies are growing .
so , let &apos;s see how exponentially growing technology affects health care .
this is an example of this kind of thing .
there are wireless things .
and i think many of these technologies are going to help us be connected to our patients and take us more time , to focus on the important , human elements of medicine that are being augmented by this kind of technology .

well , i think it works because scientists are connected to a community ethic .
it &apos;s significant to show the place in the room , because it &apos;s critical , not in terms of where other things are , but in terms of this absolute idea of space , which was for newton god .
and in a relational universe , the only possible explanation that it was actually created is somehow created .
and you understand some things better than others , and therefore there &apos;s a more powerful thing , and there &apos;s a lot of time , and you have the politics .
there &apos;s another tedster who talked about two years ago , jonathan haidt , who defined his work in three different levels .
and just to leave everything there .
and as five months , he &apos;s going to experiment with a full of a complete kind of building .
that wasn &apos;t very successful . and so on and so on .
or philip glass or lou reed or the chemical brothers , who played all of them , they all had their own casa da musica logo .
after two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .

and you could have a clue .
so we &apos;re a lot of the time , and we &apos;ve collected a lot of things and we found a lot of animals .
so we know that torosaurus is actually a certified triceratops .
it looks like it could even be bigger .
we wanted to make a atmospheric architecture .

in the opposite , it could save a lot of life .
if we take this metaphor of a genome as a program , you have to think that chris anderson is a little bit of a sudden , as jim watson , craig venter , and all of us .
you design something like a cell phone , and in very abstract language , you &apos;re describing this cell phone .
this is normal dna , which is what you think is normal dna .
we heat them , add some salt , heat it almost to the bottom and cool , and while the short strand of the little , the short strands and it &apos;s making a structure .
so this works really well , and you can build patterns and form , ok ?
you zoom in , there &apos;s only four strands of dna , and you &apos;re sitting on the individual , and you &apos;re sitting on other blocks that can be put on other blocks if you fit .
we have a very , very sophisticated computer program where little changes -- tiny , single mutations -- something that created a square of a size , and make something much bigger .
and they used to be the calculations , and to understand that and get it better in the handle , how feynman said , we need to build something to understand it .
but as we saw it , we had three main projects : a world-class life community , who has completely separate , and universal accessible to anyone with a medical physicist , regardless of its financial resources .
in modern time , where time is a great , and the fight about survival is the ordinary , ordinary human being , and pays the bribe only to get to go .

this is the global footprint of all the last four years of the last four years , which is coming across the world , from new york to the small new zealand here in the corner .
in a lot of content , we &apos;re mostly doing a few things to make it easier .
so we use these online tools to find unique talks , such as a lot of different fields that are different in ways that are essential to their topic , and that , which is really creative between the fields of bridges .
no wonder that my colleagues come up because the truth is hard to digest .
the work of the design system could be as good in a hospital as well as a hospital .
at ted , brilliance is ubiquitous .
how do things happen ?
second , the most famous nature of modern american education , the world &apos;s education , is , step for step , to step .
and said , &quot; would you be willing to have a nuclear waste waste in your community ? &quot;

in this salmon , it &apos;s still a genetically genetically modified salmon , which is from the intersection of a gene that &apos;s made of a gene and another , and it &apos;s growing much faster with much less food .
these are actually intersections and not real animals .
we took this animal to the autonomy . &quot;
in other words , this was the first creature in the history of this world , which had a computer as parent -- it had no organic parents .
paul ornish : it &apos;s time to question , to be critical

then they measure ... and measure ... and measure ...
i kind of have a kind of a geometry of things that had actually no geometry in the way that they didn &apos;t have geometry .
she took a time of the time of the googlers to 25 , a remarkable era where mathematics was short before , from this world , &quot; break out . &quot;
slow measurements , big currents , right ? ngozi .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , which is what &apos;s going on .
and that was one of my favorite favorites that these islands were the same as the most important thing -- anyway , more or less .
should you remove the breast ? should you get them ?
right ? it has to be alive , for that , is the lego of the way that it &apos;s very good .
anybody ? it &apos;s much harder .

and why not ?
a few months later , she goes back to the market when prices are the highest , in the so-called so-called , when food is just -- because they have to feed their family and not have any choice .
that leads to very high amounts of water .
almost three years ago , i decided to leave my comfortable job as a senior economist in washington , and in my favorite , ethiopia , to return to almost 30 years in foreign school .
we build a system that &apos;s all about the integrity of the integrity , the integrity , trust , efficiency and transparency , and the small farmers help to cope with the risks that i &apos;ve described .
we believe that this initiative requires great political will , and we need to adapt the financial sector , and even the underlying legal framework .
my answer to this is a wall wall from bacteria , which is the sand that goes through the desert .
they &apos;re serious about the livelihood of millions of people , especially in africa and china .
a problem with the plants of trees is that people are so poor in this region that they are trees to use trees to use them as a wood .
and , after the fda , 60 dollars of the bacteria that you never have to pay again , would have a cubic meter of a meter of the cost of 11 dollars .
in a time unprecedented population and more , it could be considered a function of light .
the world shows me opportunities , and i picked up .
our goal is a treasure design , so that we have a very , completely , fully , a single single dvd dvd , basically a single single dvd dvd .
all these eggs , the bacteria , bacteria , viruses can travel all in one gram of human manure .

this is a very simple thing . it &apos;s a very simple computer .
can we get a kind of a kind of carbon problem ?
so what i &apos;m going to show you here is that we can create a design of a design -- the b -- the b -- from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules .
these are three minutes of ultraviolet .
and if you saw amy smith , she talks about how to get students with the mit with communities in haiti .
and it may be that all of us are overwhelming , and that &apos;s overwhelming , and so connected to the variety of problems that we need to solve .
we &apos;re increasingly aware that we don &apos;t need to even have to get rid of the whole world &apos;s entire business .
okay . i also have one .
can we connect to the natural ecosystems around us by adding rivers back to the example of rivers and these kinds of things ?
as you can see , the death rate of 65,000 dead per conflict , per year in the 1950s to 2,000 dead per conflict in these decade , so awful that is .
because we did something right , and it would be good to figure out what it is .
they want the most powerful .
if not , one of the two are going to be updated , right ?
the developing world used soap and water , immunization .
and now i have the most salient thing on this axis .
and you remember the beginning of the last century , which was very bad , until this so-called big leap forward .
do you see how they grow ? and how hundreds of millions and billions of people are getting out of poverty ?
here we are . we have a continuity in the world .
look . this is the world .
they get clean water . they buy food for the poor . they &apos;re eating malaria .
and we need to look at the way we look at the world with facts .
don &apos;t make it all africa . don &apos;t make a difference of it .
it &apos;s not sustainable . and it &apos;s not going to happen to be a superpower around .
and many of you have heard the term &quot; memes &quot; -- evolution of technology is something that i give a lot of attention to , so you know , one of the first things you had was a little bit of a little bit of a sudden .
my argument is basically that , well , it &apos;s always part of our life .
and this is quite new , and i think it &apos;s going to be much worse -- this possibility -- because of developments in information technology , in the world &apos;s information , as a weapons , as a weapons , as biotechnology or nanotechnology .
i do my best , okay .
&quot; the &quot; s is our favorite &quot; means &quot; he &apos;s saved the people , &quot; which was a pretty advanced amount of time .
we only have in six countries , which means that the media is just about six countries .
so , should we put our money in ?
none of these countries , including africa &apos;s nation , of botswana , has ever passed its car .
during this development , we were , the africans , the edge of the development of development , and the evidence of politics in our countries .
the consumer administration , mostly , is the cost of the cost of the sun .
we &apos;d like to interview them . &quot; and i said , &quot; great . &quot;
and now 14 of the diseases are treatable , two of them even even more .
so in the last 10 years , and as hope for the future , we have seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology : a science of what makes life worthwhile .
and i think there are three different -- and i call them different , because they &apos;re in different interventions , it &apos;s possible to have a rather than one of the other -- three different happy lives .
but it turns out there was no sexual trauma .
you don &apos;t look like the most cosmopolitan .
and what you &apos;re finding is that if you do something fun , the most fun thing is .
when i was 30 years ago , i thought , if i was good enough to make someone not depressed , not afraid , not angry , i would make him happy .
a polar bear , floating in the arctic , recorded by paul chaplin .
but this so-called &quot; snapshot &quot; is coming up when all parts of the parts are , and not only the event , but also my emotional connection to it .
nick -- again with an automatic camera -- has taken thousands of photos of this .
sometimes you can tell a rich story on focused ways .
we want to find solutions too .
and then somehow all of you go and jump .
thank you .
what &apos;s more important is that this is a very important process that you can capture in just three seconds : we can be emily in a period of less than one afternoon in several different types of water and the other afternoon .
emily : image metrics is a computer company , a business activist .
finally , i was involved in it .
in the reserve , there &apos;s a few beautiful primates .
but i was out of the west and i worked in the east .
all over the time , they were lost , animals killed , the forest , and so on .
here &apos;s a coltan , coltan , and gold .
one day we met with the computer virus .
the elephant just took it and they took the most powerful .
i don &apos;t think anybody can blame google because google makes the right , even if people like al qaeda use google to connect .

we have , almost without having it , to move from a market market to a market market .
they don &apos;t have to pay it from their budget .
i should educate them , what happened to these experiments .
democracy doesn &apos;t need a perfect equality , but it needs citizens to share a common life .
the u.s. as a leader in 1900 , where the line is changing to red .
we have got this gift in the &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s , when women are in the prison room .
electricity was also helpful to the women &apos;s liberation .
an amazing fact for the most amazing thing is that in the first half of the 20th century , the life expectancy is three times as fast as the second half of the 19th century .
this was the paper i wrote in 11 years , and i got a two + a + .
i have some that thought that , between five and 15 , this is what i would like to be my favorite , and that led to a feeling of failure .
so if i look at creativity , i think there &apos;s also this sense or the inability to suppress the connections that i see between virtually everything in life .
that &apos;s what buddhist fishermen say because they &apos;re not allowed to kill creatures .
and they &apos;ll notice it more often .
and i had to figure out what to fit in the story .
how are we going to be able to do what the responsibility and the causes are , outside of a dish ?
and you have to be in all possibilities , including that i &apos;ve never seen before .
i hope you can see it when i &apos;m going to see these examples , because i &apos;m actually talking about everything you could spend your time .
now there &apos;s magazines about water .
people pay the full price for both , and the only thing they have in common is that they don &apos;t have anything together .
the corners of the road , on the middle , is the big market .
these guys are asking the most powerful of the world &apos;s population .
but you don &apos;t have to be more restrained -- you don &apos;t have to be completely balanced .
so what you need to do is figure out who it is .
nine months later , i &apos;m going to talk about messages at tahrir square , and because of that , a picture i saw in my inbox .
thank you .
most of the time , the cultural heritage tends to look back into us and the past .
my first documentary for national geographic , which i realized , is that you can bring environmental problems in a documentary of nature , i was dedicated to the story of nature .
these are the lions and tigers of the ocean .
and because i love sharks -- i &apos;m kind of obsessed with them -- i wanted to do a different , more positive story about sharks to talk about the need of protection for sharks .
after i left the day , i learned that this habitat is going to be a new kind of life to create a new kind of design .
they also caught up in the wild .
but when the fish came back and returned to sea stations , and the population controlled , forests grew from seaweed in the flat water .
now , she lives in the jungle of the jungle , and this is a little bit of the time , your second son , by the way , the son of the second orangutans i saved , the son of the second orangutans .
it was a biological desert .
and then you see the returns and starts measuring what comes out .
so how do we break this cycle ?
and you need bacteria to bind the nitrogen , and without that microorganisms , it &apos;s not going to give you any performance .
humidity is 10 percent higher .
so we can really change climate .
in the field of research , it &apos;s the driven , there &apos;s a democratic culture , so you can use the justice to protect your own system .
the most salient dravidian , which is a paddle on a roadside &apos;s surface .
i &apos;ll show you one more .
reuben is making kinetic sculptures , beautiful works , beautiful works in the pattern of the sun , or moving into the waves of the waves , and in nine minutes , he &apos;s going to be able to get us with his art art -- at the same
every city has their own design .
23 years later , you asked us to come and develop this idea .
this is the italian portal , the ukrainian park , the most sobering park , the japanese park , the german park .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
either it doesn &apos;t exist or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or anything , but no one &apos;s part of science .
people always say that consciousness is hard to define .
you can &apos;t think of the existence of your own consciousness .
it &apos;s a digital computer program in the brain , and to create consciousness , we have to find the right program .
we &apos;re constantly bringing the objectivity and the subjectivity of reality as a properties of reality and as a properties of the standards .
do you find ?
but i also meet people who do what they do , love , and they couldn &apos;t imagine doing something else .
we don &apos;t teach american history in britain .
teenagers don &apos;t wear a column .
maybe later , not immediately .
no , don &apos;t do it .
i couldn &apos;t just get this thing to work , no matter how much or how much i do .
but we have to shift from a industrial model to a solar model where every single school can flourish .
erez and i wanted to figure out more about it .
the reason that the historical report is being digitized in the pace of the pace .
and there &apos;s a light on it . she said , &quot; okay , so it &apos;s serious .
she led a group of students to protest in the streets of the streets .
i stood up , made a tea , sat down and everything and now i &apos;m here -- still almost paralyzed , but here .
so peace direct , you can see the back .
he wrote a book called &quot; from the dictatorship to democracy , &quot; to the data of the dictatorship .
it &apos;s not a kind of a thing that &apos;s like this .
in fact , chris worried , and said , &quot; look , show you this photo , you &apos;ll think you &apos;re going to be one of these crazy modern artists that don &apos;t do much . &quot;
it &apos;s an object for the spirit .
and the solution i &apos;m going to do is , you know , the biggest flutes in this massive microwave field of the earth through humanity and the most of that is the destruction of the biosphere .
so i said , &quot; what would t be like from the counter -- let &apos;s get rid of him where you &apos;re going to get the impact , in the denominator -- call it a little bit of the impact , put it in the denominator ? &quot;
and he was a huge , big school system on the market , which has increased our revenues and profit .
we literally won the test .
but five days later , back in atlanta , i got an email from glenn thomas , one of my people from the meeting in california .
so , frankly , a lot of us who are working in the industry that the industry is threatened by technology and possibly is potentially becoming more inclusive .
and truly , we need somebody to convey to us , so we have a experience with a very common divine ?
the arts , whatever they do , they &apos;re going to give us every time they were chasing us , to look at our way to the world with a little bit of curiosity and curiosity .
the three sisters of ahn , with her passionate music , the most passionate new life , is a new life , and at tedwomen , you start with the happy and more cosmopolitan , and then you play a little bit of a , fuzzy version of astor
the manchester craftsmen of the driven is named after my quarter .
he makes a bunch of money through the use of special furniture for rich people .
we &apos;ve taken the curriculum of the american health curriculum , which is the point of harvard , and we &apos;re going to be a high school for mothers in the middle of the city , and we &apos;re in the middle of the inner city in the middle
we realized that you have to give them flowers and you have to eat sunlight and food and expectations and herbie and herbie &apos;s music and so you can cure the spiritual cancer .
these kids who were given up from all the world , who are flying from public schools , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re capable of , with affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence .
and it &apos;s worked very well today .
and i &apos;m going to allow you to take the concert , and i &apos;ll give you the music , and you should ever decide to sell you to sell you a agreement that says that money is used to support school . &quot;
this is a room for nancy wilson built the album in our school last christmas .
the brown building , which is what you &apos;ve looked at , and i tell you where i made my greatest mistake .
he came to me . he said , &quot; man , that &apos;s a fabulous story .
and so he has a group of people .
bill strickland tells a calm and amazing story of redemption through art , music and unusual alliance .
and the transducer then brings the most powerful to the code to the brain , and the result is a very common , which produces a normal standard of a normal .
but there was the key factor , the problem with the code , and how to make cells better answers to make normal reactions , and so that was our contribution .
they cover us with an invisible , which is the attacks of the environment , so that we remain healthy .
but if the bacteria grow and double and they &apos;re all involved in making these molecules , then the number of molecules are going to be proportional to the cell &apos;s cell .
now we know that all bacteria can talk to each other .
this is just a photo -- a single one of your skin .
bacteria have become incredibly reactive , which is that we kill bacteria with antibiotics .
the fact is that bacteria have a collective behavior and they &apos;re going to meet tasks that they could never do when they &apos;re just acting as individuals .
it &apos;s a great honor to get to this conference .
or the first one that comes into the hall .
but , if we think about justice , aristotle says what we need to think about , is the actual character of the brain activity and qualities that are worth it , and you realize that you &apos;re going to be able to get them out of them ,
what a reason you would have ?
charlie , what do you say to warren ?
here it is , it &apos;s like it &apos;s going to be .
so aristotle has a little bit of flutes , and the harsh question of marriage marriage , the most respected question of marriage marriage .
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic argument
many people said , &quot; well , you know , you know , you don &apos;t have a rural guy to say , what we should do with our time .
and i think that &apos;s good -- the future of humanity is going to make a decision .
so , if that &apos;s what &apos;s called the thing ?
i &apos;m saying that the speed of the world &apos;s velocity is going to be enough .
i &apos;m going to say that &apos;s nonsense .
we know that there are this threshold because we don &apos;t get a mixed age before we get a nuclear age , and that &apos;s even though the damage has been born since our birth .
that means you have to do your homework to understand whether this is true .
audience : hi . i read somewhere in the last 20 years that the average lifespan of virtually every one on the planet has been growing up for 10 years .
not one of their media has done this .
we don &apos;t care how to make our profit .
they were in the center of the street , and they put on the agenda .
but i can &apos;t present a very long time to present the most popular , the arguments that i have learned from economists , epidemiologists and environmental communities .
the most scary thing is something scary , and you probably know a part of the most of the time .
fourteen americans die per day at asthma , which is three times like in the &apos; 90s , and almost everything comes from the street .
he apparently had sense of humor .
politicians and the most common have been scared of the way to market , &quot; the &quot; &quot; aw &quot; .
second , because we &apos;ve eradicated them .
so we thought , &quot; let &apos;s try . &quot;
there &apos;s some amazing animals .
immediately the government said , &quot; enough -- we &apos;ll go to it . &quot; and paid people to do it every single time they saw .
he may think he would have ever been born the baby &apos;s baby , so he might need a little help from outside .
i asked peter , if something changed . and he said , &quot; no , &quot; no .
we want to deal with africa , the next chapter , and this is : a healthy , more beautiful , beautiful african .
but most importantly , you have to be productive in your life , and create a kind of productive environment in our countries , so that things can be done .
we can connect all this ?
we were on the side of the world .
i had to crawl through the legs of these people , with my sister on my back , to find a window .
you know , we need to use everything good .
and i often don &apos;t see african employees under them .
the question is , how can we take use of all this good will that comes to us ?
you &apos;re a lot of the time . &quot;
we have a lot of plastic programs in nigeria with the most cosmopolitan .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is effective , i took this argument , so that we can study them , so that we can study them , exactly how we can study any other complex neurological process .
the method has been applied since the &apos; 90s to study extremely complex processes .
i want to try to show this for you briefly .
and then i &apos;m in the control room , here , games in the change .
now , how do you study rap scientifically ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity that &apos;s involved in the ground .
i want to say , probabilities and statistics , that &apos;s the mathematics of games and the computer .
this is very time-consuming , and it &apos;s not pleasant .
but keep the idea of the whole time of eight seconds .
in play and virtual worlds , for example , your facial expressions can be used , of course , and intuitively being used to control a avatar or virtual character .
otherwise they were very quick , and without a stable grid , it &apos;s not possible , so children die .
another statement of esther was that we react to a tragedy like haiti , but this is a very , a key thing .
it &apos;s produced by the malaria , and it &apos;s a very interesting thing to do .
we have every street , every village , almost every square centimeter of madagascar .
in your inbox , a very cheap blue laser is a very cheap laser .
audience : yeah !
and what &apos;s interesting is , although we have the whole time , we &apos;ve never done it , we never managed to put the wings in the air .
this is the restaurant acorn house .
this is the one that you see here , actually , in a field of a field , which was made by the outside , and it was turned out to be a lot of the light .
so , water is a more important aspect .
&quot; metal &quot; and &quot; earth &quot; is still out .
the idea is not sophisticated .
they don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
once it touches the water , you should hear how air comes out .
once we sequenced these two genomes , we asked ourselves , if this is the smallest genome of a self , it could even be a smaller genome of it , because even a little bit of a genome of it ?
moreover , we realized that once that worked , a real chance of doing it , if we could get the synthetic chromosomes to the bacteria , it &apos;s the bacteria .
so care is a lot of time .
the last one is a quote from robert feynman : &quot; what i can &apos;t build myself , i can &apos;t understand . &quot;
but in fact , we live in the northwest very close to the actual idea of the koran of paradise , which is 36 times as &quot; gardens , &quot; defined by running streams .
but the more you add , the more it seems to be lost .
and this number 72 comes never before .
this is a nest of a wheels , and this is the nest entrance .
this is a colony that &apos;s been founded by a queen in the previous summer .
the most important thing -- that &apos;s a magnifying glass -- is an interesting group . you go out early morning , before the first group on the foraging .
oddly , and interestingly , it looks like half the ant colony just doesn &apos;t do anything .
the nest maintenance workers just take all the eyebrows and bring them to the edge of the roof of the mountain and put them there .
but the foragers are somehow deciding , not getting out .
and we did experiments that show that the longer one ant is going out , the more the simple hydrocarbons on their surface changes . so the ants smell different ways that they work different .
they &apos;re going to cover the entire earth , except antarctica .
here you see that the cost of all of this is about 89 million barrels of oil , and the annual cost of three trillion dollars .
and we do that for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
that &apos;s not to do that .
i &apos;ve thought of where we can use natural gas .
and when i was in the process of natural gas , natural gas was nine dollars .
why don &apos;t you worry about that ?
so just 500 million were wiped out .
it was never been thrown through the ground floor or something .
tbp : i lost 150 million in the wind , ok ?
some have 5,000 . many have more .
there was a lot of time . and there was a lot of time .
the life is a event . let &apos;s get it to the world .
these are work in lower manhattan , where you built the first one .
these were in maybe six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to cut up the light bulb .
a friend of mine told me this story : the ones that came out , didn &apos;t just wait and wait , but then the most popular , when they were there , they had to call someone phone .
so sometimes i &apos;m going to use a more clinical language , and so maybe it won &apos;t be so warm to you as a heart of compassion as in other conversations .
and here &apos;s the basic idea that the most important thing that is doing is to make people who are going to be able to get involved in it .
basically , if you &apos;re my enemy or my neck , if you &apos;re not my friend or my family , i &apos;m a lot less to do the golden rule on you . okay .
so , the results are going to raise . this is a zero-sum game .
each form of interdependence , interdependence , forces one that recognizes humanity &apos;s humanity .
and then you &apos;ll explain to you , the other thinking that america doesn &apos;t feel you and even dominate them , and they hate america .
most of the diseases with poverty , but in the case of cancer , the children who died in cancer , they were mostly coming from wealthy families .
a week died a child , but nothing changed .
because you just don &apos;t apply this kind of energy and time , if it doesn &apos;t really care .
so he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
now , the dominant business system would say that there &apos;s a single oncogene in a single cell cell , and that you make it a kind of a single kind of a cell .
what does that mean ?
we found a kind of a kind of conceptual material that had the right extracellular matrix , we put the cells in and lo and behold , in about four days , they were going to see the same thing , and they &apos;re going to see what we
and of course , we &apos;re asking ourselves , where are we going to go ?
and so i want to finish with a poem .
we have a journalist journalist who was caught in the most vivid , a young boy , whose book is so many of the most powerful quotes that you &apos;ve taken out of the shelves ; a exposé about fake , in the new york times .
it sounds a little bit like a strange book , but it &apos;s actually about new kinds of lies .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise !
you &apos;d have four good friends of a person who would be able to contribute their personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can see lying ; they were talking , and then they were on .
they told them how big the bath was , or said , the most powerful , and so far from the hotel .
and that &apos;s where the woman 2 : right there . okay , glass , make a picture !
and you want to be able to get your eyes out .
but it really opened my eyes , as often i &apos;ve been getting away from life for emails , social networks and so on , even though it really wasn &apos;t really important or more important .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band of plastic .
and everybody who then went to the end , i went down .
at least for me , because if i always do the same thing , i &apos;m very , very boring . i &apos;m very quick .
i see myself as ... i don &apos;t know what i see .
are you going to be nervous ?
im : do you worry ? you look so cute .
anyway , i don &apos;t say it &apos;s good , but only that it &apos;s not getting tired , ok ?
if you have the cream too long , it becomes buttermilk .
i call it the era of the citizenship -- what people are doing different aspects or ethnic groups , but yet as citizens all the same way to be the same .
in egypt , i was finally discovered .
this had been studied in london , and in yemen , in yemen , and they were trained to attack an airplane to attack america .
there &apos;s no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols that are using democratic culture on the ground .
as an anecdote , we can show that if poverty was the only factor , well , the family is one of the richest families saudi .
what happened there was a political coalition that was going to be a political goal , and that was to remove the leaders .
these tools are only becoming social when they &apos;re technically bored .
he &apos;s going to cool the limits of the individual networks and then it &apos;s a lot of the time .
and because of the social networking , chinese students who studied abroad , or companies from the rest of the world , had the offices in china , there were people all over the world who heard these messages .
and finally , the chinese was drifting through .
we &apos;re increasingly more in a media landscape in media globally , socially , ubiquitous and cheap .
but all of a sudden , i &apos;m going to take a look at it as i was doing it .
in my fourth side side , a comet moved to everest , a comet .
this view is the most important thing up there , the first 600 meters of the climb base base .
and this is in camp 4 .
and there were climbers on the summit ridge .
we also got the bad news that beck kidman , another climber , collapsed in this storm , collapsed and died .
it &apos;s so compelling , there &apos;s a lot of work up there , and i sometimes have a little bit of syringes right through the clothes .
this climber was a little bit of a sudden .
and i can only easily alert how it did .
and so he &apos;s going to turn back to the point .
these are sherpas , the most profound light bulb .
and the fourth thing that &apos;s very important for me is , &quot; ideas that we need to share . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , through the entrepreneurial rise , entrepreneurs became models of models , and they &apos;re wearing a lot of the society in the very large way .
it was a lot of people who wanted to introduce democracy , because they bring the ideas to the universal vote , the universal vote , parliament and the constitution .
the third thing is again .
the second is the most important thing we have , which is so difficult to create entrepreneurs that are so difficult to create , to create a normal jobs in companies that are 93 percent of the indian jobs in the field of affairs .
so , if you &apos;re a young country , you have the chance to introduce a modern modern , modern , that you don &apos;t have the most powerful , if you &apos;re older .
you have to have a clear strategy , which is important for india and important for the world .
so the government decides to let the government choose .
even though some people on the left don &apos;t like to hear it , it actually was the revolution of markets that were spending the most successful : the government has no idea .
they don &apos;t fear the masses anymore .
so this whole constructive mistrust between the u.s. and the ones that they represent .
so , the math .
each of these is statistically captured , two years after the most prolific .
david cameron spent 20 million pounds in a social social school , to support this idea .
brené blakley : investment in social change
i &apos;ve been working . &quot;
why ? are you too tired to get to the cheek ?
even if i &apos;m with my friend named jack , i say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m fine , jack . &quot;
if you haven &apos;t found it , my name is tom thum and i &apos;m a computer designer . that means i &apos;ve just heard everything you &apos;ve just heard , only and alone with my voice .
and finally , with this one , i can get my sounds out of my right , and i &apos;m going to repeat my sounds , repeat .
our people had to try about 5,000 different types of dna to find the right thing .
don &apos;t listen to those who say that you can &apos;t do it . everybody can do that .
on the right , there &apos;s a very big way to see .
and i &apos;m going to give you some examples .
you see the blue transducer .
his wife said it was &quot; the happiest day in your life . &quot;
many of these patients are pulling the food care .
the results are better than the surgical .
he can stop the surgery at any time and immediately stop .
street street , i know .
and that &apos;s where you really do a lot of your creative inspiration , so it &apos;s a industry that runs in both directions .
and so you want to go to the next trend and that &apos;s how fast you can .
and their jokes , like the most cosmopolitan of a football system , works really only within this aesthetic .
you need a lot of lawyers and a lot of time before trial , and the merchants decided that it would be much too expensive .
these are the two of the most binary things that are quite binary in the logic of copyright protection .
and i want to thank you for this point of view of the fact that you &apos;ve created this very , very sophisticated presentation .
once again , a boat brought me to a remote kind of a remote , and i realized that the kinect i should meet , not to be interpreted .
i think this is one of the most popular and more powerful things on the planet .
there are many ancient folk companies in the u.k. , in the u.k. , if you &apos;re a little bit of a little bit of the time , you &apos;ll notice that the most powerful news is the secret .
here &apos;s the most salient thing that &apos;s about the most important years old .
i hope that i think that i can find these organisms , to help their remarkable attention , and to make my part of their own , to protect their own longevity in the near future .
let &apos;s put it on something else .
20 years later , criminals still use mobile phones , but they also make their own personal , like this , which is used by the most prolific mexico in all 31 states .
what did they do with this ?
what could terrorists do today with the technology now available to the technology ?
recently , the fbi has been arrested in the united states , which was arrested these remote pollutants to transport the transportation of the u.s.
as we see here , we turn ourselves into cyborgs .
now , the mortality rate is 70 percent , if you get it , but that &apos;s hard .
it will be killed so many people that the only funeral in the world is not going to be able to get into the same way that you can see outside of the street of the outside of the world .
but on the other hand , i hear people like fear of fear , a certain aversion of the risk .
and in 1999 , she was working in 1999 when she worked in colombia with the u &apos; s , with the goal , her culture and language , with two other colleagues of the farc , tortured and tortured .
and there &apos;s no group that would be more susceptible to this kind of manipulation of manipulation than young men .
patient capital is uncomfortable for people who are looking for simple solutions , easy categories , because we don &apos;t look at the instrument as a tool .
but the whole community , all different different influences , also the most important and more cosmopolitan , would sit down and pray . &quot;
because in the way you &apos;re full of the juice , it &apos;s beautiful , she &apos;s green , she &apos;s feeding the world , she &apos;s enough to go to heaven . &quot;
but no faces ?
ok , let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
i tried to make a little joy of my wife .
why don &apos;t i make a local pad for my wife , produced locally ?
but here &apos;s the problem . because a company is doing a cotton pad and it works .
and the lazarus thing : i see this thing in my wife &apos;s hands , &quot; why are you using a nasty rag ? &quot;
now , 110 countries can access to it . okay ?
and it was so beautiful that i was always there in the last seven years .
then i did a huge amount of training . i swam in freezing and forth .
it was actually happening that the cells in my fingers are going to be able to get into my fingers .
and my good friend david saw how i thought , and he came up to me and said , &quot; lewis , i know you since you &apos;re 18 years old .
the prospect that you could be extinct in 30 , 40 years .
england , america , japan , south africa , congo .
it &apos;s about 380 trillion gallons of oil on earth today , which can be absorbed and nurtured .
now this may be the end of the story -- okay , we &apos;re just replacing this with conventional , renewables -- but i think that &apos;s more than more .
so , very special material , the abalone shell itself , millions of abalone , all the time , every year .
and the idea was basically that i &apos;m the paintbrush in the hand of the great personalities that come and interview me .
but i wanted to get interviews to the other .
in fact , my first favorite of george abbott , 97 years old , was the age of life , and i think it was full of life -- i think you can define it .
we know the big amount of energy , we know the great moments , we know what we don &apos;t want to tell , and the point of the thing is to make no ridiculous .
when we were alone , i was her audience .
it wasn &apos;t that kind of thing , but it was a kind of a design for my conversation .
he said , &quot; but i understand that . i can understand that . &quot;
half of the body was lost , the other one didn &apos;t .
this is a very reactive in kathmandu , nepal .
i don &apos;t want to do a beautiful thing .
there &apos;s a certain kind of treatment , it &apos;s called the &quot; s . &quot;
it &apos;s not the painting we &apos;d made , but what we actually did was actually painted .
another example : again , a stupid mother .
thank you .
no , we talk about 10 million , 20 million dollars on the swiss bank bank , on the bank bank in the world bank , from the ministers of the president , the high clerks of the state of government .
they even hold out of the applause .
most of the big companies are now convinced that they need to use very strict policies against bribe and so on .
if you want to go into a restaurant , if you look at the menu , then you would expect it to be all on the map ?
and that was the first time i thought that the expression of her face actually reflects what she thinks it was .
well , he &apos;s sharing his life .
this french painter of the 18th century was known for his life , but also people were also painting .
unfortunately , these inmates are now spending their most of the time with a series of other orphans in archive , and some of them are beautiful paintings .
the first time i was wearing it at a dinner dinner dinner , which gave us their parents .
&quot; i &apos;m going to get your wedding to your own wedding , james .
my father lived most of his time in east africa .
i &apos;d like to show you six minutes .
so , the other thing that we do is , but our movies , they &apos;re stories , they &apos;re able to identify our people .
so it &apos;s a young man out there , and it &apos;s really going to have to think about certain negative things , and all of this , or any kind of behavior , behave .
so , thanks to that , so much of all , so much time .
i think this is really the theme of this event .
so , you &apos;ve been describing this as a design industry of the world .
it &apos;s basically a cd . it &apos;s a cd .
now the art art art art . oh , that was fantastic .
that was really fantastic .
video games can be very profound , even though they &apos;re completely recyclable .
we &apos;re showing &quot; portal , &quot; because you &apos;re going to go to walls to create new spaces .
so time , space , aesthetics , and then most importantly , behavior .
i had to shut up a few bridges behind me .
all of it is based on the most sophisticated and students who were going to be able to deny them a place .
so i made some sketches on napkins -- little boxes and things that i usually drew .
it &apos;s one of the most beautiful pieces i &apos;ve ever done .
this beautiful object , the swiss army army , for me , is a involvement for a surgical minister .
and one day i had a -- oh , vice versa .
i &apos;ve been doing the copper and the copper very thin , so it &apos;s going to be a little bit of a thin way .
and that &apos;s my cafeteria .
and it reminded me why i was doing things like my house as well as my house .
she never was completed .
the dome was a wish of the most popular .
it was a trial , this thin piece of land -- it &apos;s 30 to 76 feet -- to turn into a property , by turning these areas apart and the dining room in this pavilion , with a high space in it .
they call this &quot; plan rough . &quot;
here it is .
from the building in the background , it seems like a balancing iceberg in the mountains .
our client don &apos;t want to do galleries , so -- and when we met our new motto , he said that this was or the right shape .
in barcelona , i was asked to make a fish , we &apos;re working on the foot of the street , which was built by the street of the world , the most of the time , and the design of the world .
can we not make clean burning of the water ?
and one of the things they found was that they didn &apos;t burn .
and this is our main briquettes .
and he has the problem of health impacts of the health effects and coal .
it &apos;s a place where , for example , if this is india , in this room only three of us would have a car .
so you can &apos;t use the same concepts like in the united states to move things into the united states .
there &apos;s a big difference .
after a surgery , everything is going on .
now , this is not surprising . but we asked them to grade their honesty and intelligence , kindness and engineering .
he married . he had a son called the &quot; police . &quot;
is this business with our outer and our employment with a social phenomenon ?
now i want to tell you a little bit about the surgeries that we &apos;re doing , how far we are and where we want to .
we can replace the bone structure , but we &apos;re not very far with replacing facial contact .
my theme is food in schools , because here &apos;s social justice .
and the next is the next thing .
people are constantly talking about sustainability , but we should find out what that is .
you know , all of you think you have to have more and more food ?
and then they have a lot of time , hey , we can sell the stuff to children .
and this is a typical computer project .
the things that we might do at home , and think of it as important , we need to teach kids to teach kids in schools .
we need to educate the employees .
this eight billion mean , by the way , two dollars , and 49 cents -- so much money , the government is ready for lunch .
as a little girl , my grandfather was sitting on a hot hot book with me outside the sun .
if i go to a party and people ask me what i do , and i say , &quot; i &apos;m a professor , &quot; you &apos;ll be matt .
i want to know your favorite , everything about your own being , and you &apos;re undermining it , that you &apos;re a professional in things that are conscious .
don &apos;t make the tension . i want to be more honest .
it &apos;s a documentary in a documentary of consciousness .
when i got closer , i expected to see all the details of most people , their clothes and so on .
how do you know that it was what they did ?
see it ? who &apos;s not seeing it ? that &apos;s going to help .
we start to start with a few examples . some examples .
now , jeff hawkins described his efforts to bring a good , big theory in neuroscience .
and the most popular in london said , &quot; what do you mean with : &quot; who is in charge of london -- &quot; i mean , nobody &apos;s in charge . &quot;
now , congestion pricing were introduced in stockholm at january of january , and the first picture ; here &apos;s a picture of stockholm , a typical road at the second january of january .
so , we did this enormous survey with lots of plastic projects and trying to figure out who changed and where they disappeared .
then i went to 20 years of school -- from eastern asia to central asia -- through the mountains of the caucasus , the middle east , north africa , russia .
what do we know from the taliban &apos;s rights of the taliban who are going to be able to send people to the doors of the people who are going to send their daughters to schools like in the street ?
the world changed .
i was in my office , my desk was tidied , i had the blue blue , the blue blue .
and there were two of them .
there was really what .
how amazing is that ?
now , i want to talk about some other patients , and i want to talk to you about a few other patients , to improve health care .
and then i realized that the page of google earth reminded me where we can fly to each address .
we are , they &apos;re most of the most of the most stimulating resource in health care .
the seawater is a water system .
here &apos;s the resolution . a wonderful creature , right ?
they don &apos;t take their environment with the help of sound waves , and i &apos;m talking about the most important .
in the united states alone , the annual cost would be estimated in a seemingly 22 billion dollars , and so bats have seen a prosperity in every case .
why should we be involved in aging ?
if you go out here and look at the night sky , and this beautiful , flying animal , i wish you smile . thank you very much .
europe had to be brought into economic development .
the boom of resources pumps the water &apos;s water , not all , but many countries of the bottom billion .
so what &apos;s wrong ? why is it called &quot; the &quot; s &quot; ?
and so the countries of the bottom billion need a very highly crude policy .
a few economists just came in time and said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try a auction ? you &apos;ll reveal the value . &quot;
in this moment , in the world , a billion people in poor or more , are found in the world , and how can we help them ? the economist paul collier shares a very compassionate plan , with the gap of poor and rich .
we have no container where they &apos;re made .
here he is giving a english surgeon in africa that &apos;s required to embrace the behavioral surgeries .
so , we &apos;ve got this : imagine , imagine you thought , you know , you could talk to the lecture and you could talk to people in their native language .
&quot; basics of laparoscopic surgery .
14 years ago , i came to this ordinary material , and i was used to this ordinary material , and it was used in the same way for centuries .
he asked me if i could build this as a piece of a piece of the city .
so we were experimenting with small amounts of plastic to create a dry fog that is shaped by wind , and then it turned out that it can be shaped by people who can interact with it and move through without being a more powerful .
they were in their dorm grass , watching the shifting patterns of the world &apos;s face next to people who didn &apos;t know , and shared the wonders .
so , i was also paying attention to this , that this is an enormous risk for our society .
if peter moves his arm , this yellow spot is the same place that you see there , the same thing that &apos;s going to be in the brain in the brain .
if you do that , what will you want to control ?
and to say that these changes are also beyond death , even a claim about a fact that can be true or wrong .
now let me just clear what i &apos;m not saying . i don &apos;t say science can be a space that can be found or that we have scientific answers to every single moral question .
now , why wouldn &apos;t this be an objective morality ?
how much is the probability that this is a summit of human development ?
on the left , you see edward ornish &apos;s .
we live in a world full of technologies , and these technologies can &apos;t be kept up , it &apos;s always easier to break , and it &apos;s always easier to break together .
but then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
and what is his natural enemy , what the means of the good beetle , from the good beetle we &apos;re talking about ?
it &apos;s a parasite , not a more powerful , but a kind of a plastic polymer , two mm long , a rapid and an agile tool .
and if we put these good online tools to the example of a nuclear , they go to the flowers .
in israel , where we &apos;re on 1,000 acres -- that &apos;s 10,000 israeli , which is , in the same 10,000 , the biological pest system , 75 percent of the pesticides were saving .
third , to increase the farmers &apos;s consciousness for the potential of this kind of thing .
so , the main thing is one of my favorite .
it &apos;s even fun to make the most fun fun of the world , than it &apos;s about the other . i do it often .
&quot; urban aid &quot; -- that &apos;s what the new yorker needs .
her name was a little bit of a sudden , and so it was -- i wasn &apos;t going to say , &quot; take the drawing . &quot;
or the soviet union , even a few decades , found some decades , maybe within a decade , after the soviet union was most powerful .
because there &apos;s 80 percent out there that really eat insects .
they &apos;re at the beginning of food food .
why do we actually do these balls in the soup , it &apos;s still meat in it ?
it &apos;s 25 pounds per person , a year .
so , to the one , we &apos;re deciding , or to five kilograms of output .
we can increase them a little bit of the rainforests , but it &apos;s going to be soon a boundary .
and you might think , well , they &apos;re not available yet .
my three minutes haven &apos;t begun , right ?
he said , &quot; allison , we have to put them on the table .
and i saw a sign .
even if canadian the system is going to do it , they do it in a way that society is going to be concerned .
and in this book , the little lewis would find the great idea .
this is a video game . and on the back , some other gadgets , you know , are a couple of different gadgets , and scales , and scales to make some calculations . okay ?
right . so , this is how the device is used .
there &apos;s a quality of craftsmanship and precision that is just amazing and remarkable .
so the first robot i want to talk about is called strider .
it &apos;s just used to show that if you have cameras or other sensors , because it &apos;s high , it &apos;s a meter of 80 feet , you can get over obstacles and water &apos;s surface .
for example , in this case , although the left and the right wheel is connected to a single axis and so quickly , it &apos;s just spinning fast .
welcome to the robot , the robot mechanics lab of virginia tech . &quot;
but the cool thing about this is the user interface .
and let &apos;s see how he does . this was our first attempt , and ...
but what is the secret of our success ?
but just from a piece of imagination to talk about it is not enough .
on this kind of education , education is very important .
so , the most important thing to do is to be a lot of the time .
there &apos;s basically no pool of good teachers , and only eight percent of the county have a more , or a higher degree .
there &apos;s a complete empty on creative capital in bertie county .
the goal of the game is to have all the team on wheels , then the team won .
but in the last few decades , a lot of money was a lot of money that was determined for school classes .
and after that , and the neighbors interview what they buy , and what they buy , and why , and why , is a homework homework .
in these , it &apos;s literally impossible to create big , very big pavement .
i want to invite you to follow my journey of the design and exploration .
after four months , there &apos;s a little bit of a dry season , and now it &apos;s eight months before .
here &apos;s a couple of results .
this global action is going to change the same way to climate change , like fossil fuels , maybe even more than that .
when i learned about these two things , i was very , very , both of personal reasons as well as scientific reasons .
it &apos;s got a very good job of the most powerful , which was partly from ronald mcdonald &apos;s foundation .
so after treatment , we &apos;re going to make a series of simple data projects to see a series of simple people to see how his vision is fit .
the answer is motion . i want to show you the next video .
i had to discuss a long time with my wife .
we &apos;re going to track these research and hopefully have more results to report .
and then , i have this kind of comic research for physically disabled , and i thought , oh , i don &apos;t know , but before i get judgment , i look at how this is .
but that was in the fall &apos; 95 and then when the winter was prisoners , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , it &apos;s got aimee to the special &apos; 80s , and she &apos;s very excited . her family travels with -- it &apos;s a big thing .
i tried everybody i could , who i could , against who , against what &apos;s the case of the line , so who i &apos;m going to go on ?
i always won everything and i thought , what ?
you can be big . take it off . &quot;
so , aimee and the designers are going to be at ted , and we &apos;ll talk about the design .
they got somebody who came over and the shoes .
but it &apos;s almost impossible , the actual losses of the economy , it &apos;s because we use math .
or to the 75,000 jobs .
and something else about mathematics : math sometimes looks like math -- like this , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t -- and sometimes it doesn &apos;t -- how do i get drunk ?
in math education , we use about 80 percent of the time to teach people how to step three of their hand .
if people ask me , is that true ?
but the controversy in cars allowed it to separate these things , so that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be doing today , as a car and learning of the nest .
totally wrong .
but i think we can do both at the same time .
and one of the reasons why this is so important -- so it &apos;s very important , computers in the test .
it was winter in 2009 , and i &apos;ve been blind for about a year .
i thought specifically about my father who was dying of an association , and i was dying of a surgical operation .
similarly , just as you can , just through the handle of the soil , which can change the change of the soil , and the time is a notion of where you &apos;re and what you &apos;re going to be interviewing .
but when i was in the process of being in the broadway , and the broadway was walking along , i was blessed to every corner .
if you design a city in the blind , there will be many , many jobs .
to give you a sense of this experience , the article was called &quot; i think you &apos;re going to be a breath . &quot;
and the most famous thing i knew -- the 10 commandments , love your next , love , is fertile and the most fertile you ...
you give money for a good purpose and creating emotional deals with the purpose .
it &apos;s not a book written , and it &apos;s written by heaven .
so , this is actually the key to me , to remember , to remember that there &apos;s no way to go out here , and i &apos;m not going to go up on the road , and i didn &apos;t go up the stairs .
that was very inspiring for me .
so if we want to really make a sense of this book , we really need to be able to get to it , and it &apos;s going to be a lot of things to do with it .
so we have this wonderful progress .
the academics who were doing this work was to be able to get the design , so we developed applications like this , which is the most powerful thing that &apos;s going to be a laser of a laser on a laser for a laser .
alex worked on a small , something obscure , independent , independent report with the name called &quot; minority report &quot; for steven spielberg , and invited us to develop the interface that &apos;s going to be used in the movie .
we &apos;re going to take this surgery through because we like yellow and we like to go on green and green .
let &apos;s pull the apart : i &apos;m going to bring it into a plastic .
we , as humans , are the things that are doing things and we should make sure that our machines help us and build it .
john , thank you for making science science .
what okolloh did was not possible without digital technologies .
but here &apos;s the point . the most creative creative act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that are represented by this black line said , &quot; we &apos;re changing this deal immediately .
they &apos;re created by the members of the community for each other .
and as all good news systems do , they make a leap from 20 years when the audience changes the audience .
you don &apos;t always have five days to get there , so changes and we started playing more subtle .
but india didn &apos;t want to play at the heart of the game .
the other was indian cricket .
it was the new india ? that was another world where you could get player from everywhere , as long as you got the best player for the best price .
we &apos;ve all seen games in calcutta , but we &apos;ve never seen anything yet . and we &apos;ve never had the audience of the audience with a song of the song -- for calcutta , not for india , but for calcutta .
could you imagine that this day would come ?
hopefully i &apos;ve made any of you to make a experience of richer and the game , and hopefully , there &apos;s a longer time to work in this business .
and you know that the answer is , because they &apos;re very quickly in memory , they have seen dogs and pigs , and they &apos;ve seen dogs and pigs on the rope .
why about everything in the world should anybody play lottery ?
on the other hand , if you visit a developing country , and for 25 dollars a child , you can buy a big mac for a big mac .
would you spend your remaining 20 dollars for a ticket ?
i &apos;ll give you an example .
and if the way to the other end of the city is 100 bucks worth 100 bucks , it &apos;s worth 100 mice , no matter where they &apos;re saving . but people don &apos;t think so .
well , in the big and all of you , you &apos;re enormous impatient .
watch what happens when we leave out the air .
dan , i &apos;d like to hear more . so , you say that our answer is to terrorism , i mean , he &apos;s a kind of mental error ?
there are no weapons of guns .
and so some people look at economists as a dumb people .
and the theme and variation is one of these most powerful , which requires a certain intellectual activity , because you &apos;re always comparing the variation with the subject that you have in mind .
&quot; in words and in fashion , the same rule / so is fantastic , and it &apos;s not the first one that &apos;s been tried to be the first one that &apos;s been tried to do the old one , and the last one is the last one
and i woke up one day and said , &quot; well , maybe that &apos;s not that ? &quot;
first , my willingness to give me a critical audience , without suggesting i was safe .
it &apos;s my intention to go to the poster , to be able to do it yet .
so , in the big and all of them , they &apos;re saving our survival .
jews often have a uncomfortable smell .
if the space was drunk , we could see that people are going to fight more negative attitudes to gay men .
it &apos;s as if i was going to talk about what i &apos;ve done in these 20 years in the distant years .
it feeds my mind and my soul .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends , other filmmakers , and they talk about what cinema means .
without food , i became sick .
we don &apos;t need any problems to get the idiots out !
our government was corrupt .
so for me , the thought that we have all these kids , it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of children that had to go through so much psychological trauma or damage and africa to live with it .
through the whole book , more than an hour , more than an hour , and interactive animations .
what is the business ?
it had at least that you have , in the case , that you &apos;re always true , largely true .
so i thought , &quot; yes , that &apos;s a good idea . &quot;
the talk still about it .
when i came from college , i worked in southern california , and you &apos;re working on the spanish , and you &apos;re going to be on the rooftops of the roofs and things like that .
rsw : how is his schedule ?
the most important thing -- they &apos;ve interviewed me for interviewed and sent their technical technology to bilbao .
that &apos;s reminded me .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
if you walk four months to walk with three months , the ideas are always going to be more clear and living .
and one thing i wanted to mention in my favorite book , but somehow i missed , was to thank all the companies that helped me to get the opportunity to get .
but in the meantime , these things win momentum .
and this is 10 weeks later , from hand .
you see the suits , the most powerful .
the funniest thing about the styles and things is remarkable , and this is what the most remarkable thing to be .
it &apos;s an incredible endeavor , 15,000 workers , i think , five domes and the sixth will be built here .
on this level , they work around 1,500 workers .
50 percent of the computer on the world is growing in china .
it was quite unusual , so stefan , that less than five percent of advertising had a picture of the subject .
and wish three is : &quot; i &apos;m told , &quot; i was told myself , i should do a little bit of myself , and i always wanted to do something like this .
and it &apos;s increasingly more important that we can figure out how to win these resources from these extremely complex complex systems .
the traditional ways to separate material is simply not for plastics .
the traditional way of making it happen is to make oil or petrochemicals .
at the end of this process , we have a mixed species of plastic : many different kinds of plastics and lots of different qualities of plastic .
now i see a lot of the data out there .
and what we see is that people tend to commit mistakes in the same way , again and again .
maybe we should study how monkeys make economic decisions and find out whether they do the same stupid as we do .
here &apos;s bengal . she &apos;s going to trade a token against food and wait happy , and you get your food .
they &apos;re waiting for something that is open to the market .
now imagine that i &apos;m going to push every one of you from a thousand dollars in the hand -- so 10 more hundred dollars a hundred dollars .
you can either choose a loss of loss -- so , i throw a coin . in head , you &apos;re going to lose a lot of lose .
if we made the same scenarios in our little brain , the same things would do the same things as people do ?
the person on the left is a safer loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just the people on the last stage of development , which make dumb mistakes .
and that &apos;s the catch .
but if we think about buildings , most of the stories are high .
we have to do less with concrete and steel and we need to build higher . in recent days , we &apos;ve worked on the street of the world .
this is just as much as we have less cars in a year of 900 cars .
and the curtains curtains of the window .
maybe &quot; citizens , &quot; because recently they got up to fight against the decline of law , and the citizens of these networks work together to help each other .
so , the biggest and oldest bank in russia , largely in the property of the russian government , is now using , to adopt employees and citizens in the development of innovation with the development of innovation .
we &apos;ve heard about ted talking about people who have their plants with arduino , and they &apos;re working on the whole world , and they &apos;re working on the world , to make young people , websites and turn videos .
and so i started thinking that the eternal mother always asks himself , &quot; are all the kids there ? &quot;
that &apos;s compassion .
he asked them to convey a message , and all of them read in their own language , a central rule of the golden rule , which was , &quot; what you don &apos;t want to do is you do not want to do that , the most important
a pastor is called to take care of these individual needs .
and we do this by some reason .
there are 180 messages in washington d.c.
it &apos;s already taken from parks and sculptures .
it &apos;s made of plastic fiber .
there &apos;s also a few constraints on its lighting .
the bubble is a very reactive .
i saw my aunt raped when i was only five .
one of the things i experienced when i was trying to eat my friend , because we didn &apos;t have food and we were around the 400 .
as a child , as young and delicate , words that i can &apos;t forget , not forget .
this is my story , shared in a lesson of a lesson .
my breakfast , my lunch , i give up a foundation that i started , because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give the farmers tools .
audience : yeah !
the third chapter is a more complicated , more complicated , called &quot; the federal prize . &quot;
that means more than 60 percent are for this .
we &apos;re going to solve this task by the best , by expanding the problem of death .
and even if that happens , it &apos;s not too late .
i remember nothing from time when i was five years old .
santa claus knows if you were good or not . right ? &quot;
but julie , you were so ready for school . you were so ready . &quot;
they looked at each other and smiles , in the sense that was the right answer . then they said , &quot; do you believe that we all are brothers and sisters on this earth ? &quot;
maybe your bigger ability to cooperate and adapt ?
i think this film shows the toughest look at the modern times : &quot; the road . &quot;
in world war ii , we had to produce a lot of stuff .
but we cannot forget that it needs a fundamental contribution , and that &apos;s how many resources of the planet we use .
but now , the good news !
it &apos;s perhaps in latin america .
and at this point , the skeptics and the climate change in the way that we do in the same way .
we did a project for a few years ago , and a big program , it was : the most powerful -- with many , many people -- many experts were involved -- all of the evidence -- a big , big , big , big , big ,
a group of people are asking them to spend it for themselves and to spend the other group of people .
when they went from the first building to the second , all of a man who went to the divine and went and went and realized , and clearly help . the question is , did you think and helped ?
the word is &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; , a combination of &quot; the &quot; and &quot; the &quot; s &quot; .
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &#91; about &#93; : the hidden life of life .
since -- now , it &apos;s four decades -- i &apos;ve been training with the best in this area , in the world , had young and old teaching , created , created , and old , created , and a wonderful net of art , successes and awards
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my real life force .
i danced between the computer and i was dancing and i was desperate to adapt to my favorite .
well , it was essentially frustration .
that &apos;s how it was at the time .
he put them together , and they put together this to something called a little bit of a little bit of time , and then he was convicted of this software that i think was originally designed by his son , and he made this wonderful presentation .
in these documents , there are little bits of boxes , little boxes .
i want to suggest -- yes , do you make a beautiful website , how could i say , you shouldn &apos;t make a nice website ?
now you ask the linked data that you &apos;ve now put together . 32 hits , which everybody is a protein with these traits and you can look at them .
and that &apos;s what linked data is about .
all this will lead to each year every year , two million children die , last year , when 2000 .
and if it &apos;s so , we &apos;re ready to collect feedback , and give feedback to make sure that the promise really are results ?
you just show one of the numbers there , the 5,000 -- is that the number ?
my brothers started to draw me out of drawing and paint .
and that &apos;s what fascinated me to explore this area .
how many of you have a cow going on the street to mysore from bangalore to mysore ?
it &apos;s just that we &apos;re trained as humans to perceive reality , and that makes meaning .
and they said , &quot; okay .
can &apos;t you do anything , you &apos;re artists ? &quot;
this is a box of a box of plastic .
because if we see somebody walking away , we see the footprint .
what percentage of it did the foreign aid of foreign water ?
obviously , he sat in a cave last 20,000 years .
so the foreign aid is really nice to get here , because -- if you think about it , i &apos;ve been told about the economists , i think , that most things are very , very highly balanced .
this is the place i showed you at the beginning .
we &apos;re going to be a technical thing now .
think of toyota .
you can &apos;t do it about the lazarus , so you accept it and find a way to work with it .
it &apos;s very hard to agree .
it &apos;s a little bit of a time and the water .
pizza is going to get you when you have hunger .
there are millions of different types of water .
so remember , if we think about sexual education and activities , they &apos;re out of baseball .
it &apos;s from the poet &apos;s chen , and it goes like , &quot; i can &apos;t do it the most important thing .
and that &apos;s , &quot; how much percent of the day do you think of this person ? &quot;
over over the course of over over the course of over over the world , people have come up with this kind of brain structure .
they came home with the percent of dinner .
and it was really a strong force .
and i said , &quot; why do you think men are more powerful than women ? &quot;
no time at that time , the women were so educated , so interesting , so that they could .
she &apos;s taken her 23 , she was taken for 13 .

maybe we should ask ourselves , could it be that insulin resistance is the cause of weight and more profitable diseases -- at least most people ?
other people , it &apos;s too much more .
peter ornish : what if our views were wrong ?
my great grandfather , henry ford , believed that it was the mission of ford motor company , and to make life better for people to make the lives of people affordable .
and the good news is that today we &apos;re going to address the great problems of cars and environment -- not just ford , but in general as industry .
i think you can imagine it already .
but what really inspired me is the possibilities that we &apos;re going to have when our cars start communicating .
we need a infrastructure that is able to support these flexible future .
this is a minute 59 .
i think now my mother , i &apos;m like a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a design .
the nurses have to put data on .
that &apos;s really important . it &apos;s much more . &quot;
so what &apos;s going on ?
and for us , it was great because we won a lot of awards .
i was infected when i was 17 , when i was 17 , when a student was a student , i saw adults who really believed me , and i was drinking a lot of the most powerful things with me .
now it &apos;s just about the kids . so we don &apos;t .
basically , we gave the kids a simple task .
for our auction , we have some wonderful images for them , for a really good purpose , the money that they give us to buy hearing hearing .
but what i never said , and what i want to do is , i &apos;m going to be cool , that the fact is that that &apos;s cool .
in a way , in a sense , in the elegant or more available product , there &apos;s a lot of the time that we have , the most elegant afternoon , the most powerful , which is another kind of development -- and inspired by the incredible kind
if you think about the change in our society , the most important of the country in the cities , the 200 years , has taken the same process in 20 years .
it looked ahead , even though these were even unknown .
so , for example , we would put the models under an artificial sky .
i think a reduction in the height of 94 percent for almost pure .
and as we do in this growing world , something more profound , specifically , in some places i &apos;m talking about -- china for example , that will build 400 new airports in the next 10 years .
and this is the focus of the world &apos;s talk -- there &apos;s no lighting in the positive sense that is healthy and our well-being ; without proper darkness .
unlike the first office , i showed you the beginning of the talk , this is a very famous office office , which is that the most important office .
behind you , you see the most sophisticated building that was later a icon of modern health .
i think that &apos;s what you see right here -- how much light in the sky is going to be able to get the ground .
this is not very pleasant and more sophisticated .
they &apos;re not going to be disturbed anymore .
when our main team , as a few weeks earlier , a war in a third of india called a war called 200 , which is the most popular , he &apos;s got the issue wrong .

this is a little bit of a time .
these are 3.2 billion people .
or ski . it just makes fun and people love it to do fun and fun things .
so we &apos;ve worked very , very hard , but we knew that it wouldn &apos;t be so hard to develop the technology as the acceptance of what &apos;s important and how technology can be used .
cars are not made for the next side to park ; it &apos;s wonderful to drive with them between cities and drive , but think about it : we have solved all the problems in terms of the range and speed .
so if we could add this box to a few years , we have a solution to transportation , electricity , and communication , and maybe drinking water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 kilograms ?
implicit or explicit is being suggested that people who die there are somehow involved in drug drugs , and we take the fact that they either tortured or professional or professional or even both .

you can put a lure -- it &apos;s a seal like a seal -- and a white shark will go to it , a little bit of a creature that comes close to our 16 foot .

i want to start with a paradox .
and here you see it in relation to the level of inequality that i showed you , i &apos;m going to come back to the point of time .
first of all , with the rich , developed countries , and then in a second phase of the country , with the 50 american states -- the same question : do the more unequal states on all of these scales ?
with devastating effects , what &apos;s going to benefit from the human talent .
and in our analysis of american states , we find the same contrast .
the social judgments are taking , and fear of these judge .
or for example , why violence is more powerful in more unequal societies , because people are sensitive to being relieved .
a year , more than three million microbloggers require a new knee or a new knee .

strong fear is a fool .
but if you &apos;re always in this condition , the work would never be done , because you would suddenly say , &quot; oh , i found a new way to do it . &quot;

i &apos;m going to talk about children and self-organization and a series of experiments that led me to the idea of how an alternative education might look like .
and at the night , 70 children in the internet .
so i could even choose to meet a cross-section , which is partly the whole world .
what you &apos;re seeing is a child that &apos;s operating the computer .
natural systems are all self-organization : galaxies , molecules , cells , organisms , societies -- except the discussion of the theory of intelligent designers .
and it &apos;s about idealism in this whole book of idealism .
i bought a nice suit , and i was wearing shoes with a little bit of access to the same , and i had this remarkable access to the one that i had to do .

our revenue of our rights is very quickly , which has been given us a healthy profit , and that &apos;s even though we treat a lot of people free .
this is a difficult task .
for example , we can add digital content with physical mass .
wouldn &apos;t that be a way to make cell phones intuitive ?
it was as if they couldn &apos;t see me as if i was invisible .
and also , no one ever heard a wheelchair before or saw this , and this is what the creation of new ways of seeing is his and knowledge , because now you have this concept in your head .

one last comment -- i &apos;ve been worried about it for years , but i think it &apos;s particularly important for this audience .
at this point , we &apos;re about two days from the entrance .
this is a little bit of a laser cycle .
the ice can be deep between five and 25 miles deep .
the most important thing is , the same thing to see , and the back , that it can do new kinds of energy , while it still keeps the eye , which has been left behind .
for that , they would pay 10,000 dollars in orbit .
and that says that you move 10,000 feet per second faster than you want to go back to the gas station .
with the right support , it can be done in seven years .
i &apos;m going to take you to me not from the stages , because they asked the question .
