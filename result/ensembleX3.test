you know , one of the great most powerful things in the travel and one of the pleasures in the world &apos;s research is to live with people who can remember the old days , and they still feel the wind , they &apos;re touching the rain , they
just knowing that the world &apos;s still beyond the milky way or the importance of the myths of the oldest of the inuit , is still full of meaning , or that the himalayas is still the breath of the world &apos;s breath , which is the idea that
and of course , we all share the same thing .
we &apos;re born all . we &apos;re bringing kids to the world .
we go through the street .
we have to be able to deal with the tncs separation of death and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dance and art .
but interesting is the unique tone of the computer &apos;s unique , rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the most important in the woods of borneo , or the warrior in haiti , or the warrior in the most violent of the desert , the most cosmopolitan in the eastern ridge , or a little bit of the middle
all of these people teach us that there are other kinds of things that are more useful , other ways of thinking about the earth .
and that &apos;s a notion that , if you think about it , you can just fulfill hope .
together , the myriad cultures of the world are a net of the world &apos;s population , and cultural life , which is the earth , and for the world , the world &apos;s most important , as the biological flu system , you know as the biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural cultural model as a design of a design , and the way you can think of it is the most important thing about all thoughts and dreams , myths , ideas , inspiration and intuitions , which have been made by the human imagination
the most amazing legacy is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and what we &apos;re capable of as amazing species of species .
and as the biosphere was very much misunderstood , this was what happened to the most important speed .
no biologist would say to say that 50 percent or more of all species are just about extinction , because it &apos;s simply not true , and yet , this -- the most powerful thing that &apos;s known as the most powerful thing on the area of cultural diversity
and the key prediction for this is extinction .
when everybody was born in this room , there were 6,000 languages spoken on the earth .
now , a language is not just the whole of the vocabulary or a series of a series of plastic .
a language is expression of human mind .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a particular culture is going to find access to the material world .
every language is like a forest forest of the mind , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem , a ecosystem spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages today , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , the half of the children are not in the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught to be taught anymore . that means if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely than being the silence of being a few of the last people who speak to your language , not to have a way to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or to expect hope to expect children ?
and yet , this horrible destiny actually comes to someone somewhere on earth , about all two weeks , because all two weeks , a elderly dies , and it takes the last polish person to the grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; is it not better ? &quot; is the world not a better place if we all would talk to a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be a language . let &apos;s be a
let &apos;s be kogi . &quot;
and then suddenly you would see how it would be if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so i want to take you in a journey today through the world &apos;s office , a short journey through the surface of the world to try to understand them , which is actually lost .
now there are some of us who are sort of forgotten that i say , &quot; different possibilities of his , &quot; really different possibilities of his own .
for example , take this kid of the world &apos;s book in the northwest of the amazon , the people of the amazon , believe that they &apos;re going to be the most prolific of the east from the east of saint snakes .
this is a people who not cognitively between the colors blue and green , because the forest of the forest , the people who depend on the forest , is the people who depend on it .
they have a strange language and a more sophisticated language called the linguistic language , you have to marry somebody who talks to another language .
all of this is the roots in the globalized past . the very strange one of these big houses , where the most of the houses are spoken , or seven languages , is that you &apos;re never talking to anyone who learns a language .
you just hear to speak and start talking .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the most amazing people in the northeast of ecuador , a remarkably people who were in 1958 .
in 1957 , five of the objections were trying to contact and made a mistake .
they threw out the shiny photos from the air , which we would consider as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people from the rainforest had never seen anything more like a little bit more .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see behind the face or the character , found nothing and the most educated that this is business business , and killed the five punchline with the spear .
but the most popular ones didn &apos;t only kill the spear with the spear .
they &apos;re going to be a different one .
54 percent of the deaths happened by the deaths .
we were looking back at eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death and when we were doing the people with a very crude thing about it , they gave them that one of the people who had gotten so old , they were killing
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
their hunters could smell the urine of a animal from 40 steps away and determine what species of these people .
in the early days , i got a really amazing task when my professor asked me to go to harvard , if i was interested in haiti , and to infiltrate the secret societies that were the foundation of the strength of the power and the poison , and
so to give you a sense of this big thing , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of the most remarkable belief of the world &apos;s remarkable magic and voodoo is not a cult of the black magic .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex kind of metaphysical worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked them to be approved , the great world world , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , or whatever .
a continent is going to leave out , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious faith in sub-saharan africa , and of course , there was a little bit of the bottom of the very profound religious thought that &apos;s the tragic of
but what &apos;s interesting is that this is the kind of living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living supply of the minds .
the spirits can be made by the big water , answers to the rhythm of dance to protect the soul of living , so that the most low-tech moment for a little bright moment becomes the god .
and the most important thing is , the most popular , &quot; your white white is in the church and you talk about god .
we dance in the temple and we will be god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the mind , you &apos;re going to get off the mind . how can you be done ?
look at this amazing demonstrations : the red demonstrations in a museum that &apos;s red coal without burning , an amazing visualization of the ability to influence the body that this is the body that is going to be a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all people i met , the kogi was from the sierra nevada de santa &apos;s museum in the most extraordinary , most extraordinary .
offspring of the old civilization , the heart of the caribbean , who &apos;s covered the heart of colombia , and in the end of the 1990s , that people moved into a very violent fashion , which is the most pervasive , which is rising over the caribbean
in a museum of a continent , these people were the only ones who were never approved by the most of the time .
until today , you &apos;re going to be dominated by a ritual priesthood , and the education is very extraordinary , but it &apos;s very extraordinary .
the young people are separated in the age of three and four years of their families , and in a world of darkness , in the base of the glacier , in the base of the glacier for 18 years , two periods of the glacier , they &apos;re
and during this whole time , you &apos;re going to be culturally introduced to the values of your society , values that sustain the claim that your prayers and your prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
at the end of this amazing , you &apos;ll get a day out of the day , and for the first time in your life , you see a sunrise , and in this particular moment of consciousness , you see a sunrise , and in this particular moment
it &apos;s so wonderful . you need to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think about native victims and landscape , we either have a little bit of the old and the old , the old wild of the fancy wild , which is a very , very , very , very connected , and saying , these people are more
so , native people are not sentimental , they &apos;re going to be supported by the nostalgia .
it &apos;s not a lot of space in the most profitable life of the world &apos;s life , or the cold winds of tibet , but yet , they have a mystery of the earth , but they &apos;re actually shaped by time and ritual , which is not
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid from the andes , who are growing in the belief that the mountain is a mountain , which is a very different , or your destiny , will be a very different person , and a different relationship to that resource , and
whether he &apos;s a shocker of a mind or a bunch of a bunch of a mind , is irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor , which defines the relationship between the individual and the nature .
i grew up in the forests of british columbia , and i believed that these forests are there to become a plastic .
and that made me a different person as my friends under the front of the world who believe that these forests of the plague of the plague and the curved spirits are the most prolific and the most dramatic spirits that are living in the world , would be
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is a lot of the time , from the many of you who have heard the most powerful , the most powerful thing that &apos;s going on from the repertoire of the brain .
what makes it fascinating is not just the most powerful potential of this kind of thing , but it &apos;s actually going to be made of two different sources of this , and it &apos;s actually made of two different sources on the one side , there &apos;s a
these plant contains some very strong things that serotonin , and the serotonin , and the very similar thing is very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the most sophisticated , you &apos;ve seen this stuff that contains this stuff that contains you from different species .
this powder is about being shot from a kind of a sea trip , and it &apos;s about a sea of the image of the sun , and the landing of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to be made of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have with my professor , richard evan , who &apos;s the man who had the most powerful of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the u.s. and the magic years , and i said that you couldn &apos;t be able to put this in the way that
but the thing about the thing that is , the thing that you can &apos;t get is that you can &apos;t get rid of it , because of course , it &apos;s a human gut , of course , with names of the brain , and of course ,
you can only be put in connection with some other chemicals that the mao &apos;s bird &apos;s .
now the fascinating thing is that the most amazing , the most important thing in the world &apos;s brain , are the kind of thing that is necessary to be able to get the energy care of the world . so ask yourself .
how can these people from a thriving species can &apos;t find these two kinds of plants that are not related to these two , which , if they combine this way , a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a version
we use this great euphemism , trying and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
but you ask the indians , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the most powerful , have 17 varieties of plastic , which you see all of the big distance in the forest , which is a kind of view of our eyes .
and then you ask them how they put their online and they say , &quot; i thought you &apos;re going to understand something from plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you &apos;re going to take every 17 varieties of wood and sing them in a different fashion program .
now , this doesn &apos;t bring you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting .
now , the problem is that even the problem of ourselves , the sympathy for the difficult situation of native americans , they look at the most difficult and more powerful , but somehow , they &apos;re just going to be limited to the past while the real world
so , the fact is , you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century , in 300 years , or technical innovation , but rather than a era where we were present and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth either , or passive
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new organizational systems .
and the problem is not the technology .
the most popular people didn &apos;t have less to be on sioux than they were , and the arrow of tasks , when americans stopped being americans , when they were the horse and the horse .
not change and technology , the integrity of the world &apos;s integrity , it &apos;s power . it &apos;s ugly face of the rule .
and wherever you &apos;re in the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures are not the decline of the decline . these are dynamic living peoples that are displaced by their existence , and they &apos;re being displaced by the most amazing deforestation in the country , and
or if we go to tibet , where i &apos;m going to work a lot , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the genocide , the most prolific extinction of people , but the most common , the destruction of the lives of people , will not only be charged , but generally , and the most powerful as part of a brain program .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of tibet if you haven &apos;t seen it on the ground level .
i went to a young colleague of 350,000 miles from 350,000 miles from a city of heroin , and i was just as when i came to the back of the back of the statistics , and i saw the face behind the statistics of the statistics that were
the father of this young boy was identified as a followers of the horse lama .
that meant that he was immediately killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle was whistling with her holiness in the diaspora , who brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked up when punishment for -- to be wealthy for the crime .
he was smuggled in the prison of two years to hide in the prison , to hide under her own , because she couldn &apos;t live without it .
the sister who did this brave was brought into a plastic scanner .
one day she came out of a set of a set of trips , and for those of you who had to have a heavy labor camp , she had to work for seven years in a heavy camp .
the suffering of tibet can be disappointed , but the most important mind of people is a little bit more nuanced .
and at the end of the day , we really have a choice . do we want to live in a world of the world &apos;s world , or in a world of diversity , in a world of diversity ?
margaret ornish , the great anthropologist said before she died that it &apos;s her greatest fear that while we &apos;re moving towards a thread , we &apos;re not just going to see the whole range of human imagination , but we would have to wake up a dream of
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species have been there for 600,000 years .
the most popular revolution that brought us agriculture , and we put the cult of the cult of the cult of the world &apos;s dilemma , which is replaced poetry of the priesthood of the priesthood , and the hierarchy of the priesthood created -- found 10,000 years ago
the modern industrial world as we know it is not 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we &apos;re in the next millennia .
if we ask these myriad people to ask the importance of human beings , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to address the possibility that we are : people with full awareness that are aware of the importance that all people and gardens are able to flourish to be able to flourish and have a great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took at the northern end of the mountain , when i went to the top of the street , and this man , the most wonderful , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the most recent years of the world &apos;s population , they were forced to pull in settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the guns and all the tools .
now you know that the inuit don &apos;t have fear of the cold , they used them to their advantage .
the most recent of her sled were originally made from fish , which was made in the wild .
the man &apos;s grandfather was not afraid of the arctic night or the flying storm .
he was looking outside , and he made his pants off , and he had his hand , and when the feces started to market , he formed them in the form of a a a button .
he &apos;s got the flag on the pages of the mountain and when it was completely frozen , he was a dog with it .
he &apos;s the dog and he was a tutor , and he took a tutor , and he took a panda skeleton , and he was a hanger , and he took a different dog on the top of the house with the computer bank on the ground .
you can do anything like that .
and this is a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all indigenous species in the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april 1999 , the complete control over a field that is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country , and it &apos;s called the world &apos;s home .
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control the whole area .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state , the state of the world , can be able to look for his people and reach .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are traveled to these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they &apos;re the most popular of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that go back in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children are going to be part of the children of the geography of the hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we believe that politicians never achieve something .
we believe that the fact that we believe that we don &apos;t believe that the most compelling thing is that we think that storytelling can change the world , and we think that storytelling can change the world and we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the
156 nations send our food supply .
our magazines are read by millions .
and we &apos;re doing a series of trips to the most sophisticated , which we take our audience to places like such cultural wonders that they &apos;ve been blinded by the degree of the world , and hopefully , they &apos;re going to be able to take a lot
thank you .
what i first do , as quickly as possible , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we microsoft , as part of a year ago , have been going to be a single set of a year , and it &apos;s a environment where you can
we see many , many on digital photographs here , which you &apos;re going to be in and continuously , and the way that you can put it in a way , and the way it &apos;s going to be new , is to set up to a whole
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we &apos;re looking at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of the library of the library and it &apos;s in a domain of 300 , and it &apos;s 300 .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that the performance of a system can be like this is the number of pixels on your screen in every moment . it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of the design of the world .
this is a little bit of the house house of dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it really is a text and not about a picture , we can do something like this to really show that this one real representation of the design and no image is .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a more powerful way .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a very , very , very simple case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a section .
and that &apos;s really what you &apos;re doing , and the good experience of reading a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of a medium with multiple scales .
we also did something about the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a false ad with very high resolution that is much higher than a normal display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical consultants .
and this really reaches these ideas , these limitations for the available place on the screen .
we hope that that &apos;s not a shy of the other nonsense , and it &apos;s not necessary to be .
of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i &apos;m not really going to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we &apos;re going to be able to contribute to this area .
but these are all roads in the united states .
the top on the top of the nasa picture of nasa .
let &apos;s take a little bit of it out .
now , this is even live in the internet . you can get it out of it .
this is a project called the name of the name , which is really two different technologies together .
one is a very good research , and the other is a very good research about the world &apos;s worth of the university of washington , a university student of washington , under the counseling of steve , at the university of steve .
and rick &apos;s research was done by microsoft research . a very good collaboration .
so this is live in the internet . it &apos;s driven by the internet .
you can see that if we create these kinds of views , where we can penetrate through images and make these experiences of the multiple resolution .
but the spatial orientation of the images is actually meaning .
the most common ones have been put together these pictures that they put in the real room , where these images that are all near the most close of the world &apos;s land in the canadian twin , they &apos;re going to be shown in the canadian slides ,
i don &apos;t know exactly if i &apos;ve got to show you other environments .
there are which , you know , are much more competitive .
i &apos;d like to show you a straight data machine of noah and that &apos;s from a early prototype of the world we &apos;ve been working on in summer to show you what i think is really the punchline behind this technology that is the key line that we
we had to make ourselves care about the lawyers .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral , accused of the cathedral of the images with images of flickr , just give them an opera in flickr , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the ground , and they &apos;re going to
so this is all the kind of thing that &apos;s all about , and they all stand in the way in relation to each other .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i will end up working at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
and i suspect you can see that this is a lot of different cameras : everything is about the professional standards of professional school , a pretty large number of them , which were all in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird ones .
many of you are covered by faces .
somewhere here , there are a series of photographs -- here you are .
this is actually a poster of notre dame , which was recorded right .
we can shift from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point is that we can do things with social environments , and it &apos;s now collected data from all the collective storage of how , the whole collective memory of how , visual earth is going to look like this , and everything will be connected .
all these photos are connected to each other and it creates something bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from all the earth .
look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen earth &apos;s work .
and that &apos;s something that is through the complexity that people use , and it &apos;s growing and use the user for the user .
their own photos are going to be with $ lethal , which has a different person .
if someone has done the trouble and all these sacred artists have been labeled , and they &apos;re all going to be able to be able to do my photo , and then i can use my photo from the notre , and i can use it as a
and of course , byproduct of all these are the immense rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not just through the surface of the earth or satellite images and so on , but through collective memory .
thank you .
do i understand it right ? your software allows you to be able to be in a certain period of time , all the images that are used by someone in the world , basically , are associated with each other ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t make anything else than discover .
if you want to make them in the images of the images .
and it &apos;s doing this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the amount of the information of the information , which many of these images have .
as if you do a little bit of a design for pictures where you &apos;re putting sentences and the text of the website , many information is about that , which is the picture .
but how would it be if the picture is linked to all your pictures ?
then the amount of the crocodile is the amount of the crocodile and the abundance that makes it really enormous , it &apos;s a classic classic .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , how i hope to be in the mix with other things that you &apos;ve heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections if you haven &apos;t noticed that .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official &quot; official .
the official of what ?
the official official of all western industrialized societies .
the official state of the state is that if our goal is to maximize the common of our citizens , this is particularly due to the freedom of freedom of the individual .
the reason that freedom is good in itself is valuable , valuable , a sense of a human premise for human .
if people have freedom , everybody &apos;s going to be in the way to do things that our collective people maximize and nobody has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply that it would not be in the sense of question .
and it &apos;s also deeply rooted in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what &apos;s causing us modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say something about the more exciting .
there &apos;s five of the major things in my supermarket when you don &apos;t get the 10 extra extra extra extra gas cells and 12 of them you could buy to make a big number of their own lettuce , in which unlikely case is not the $ 1
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the business store to put a stereo -- speaker , a little bit of a radio , radio , a radio , and in this one , and there &apos;s a electronics that &apos;s so many stereo plants .
we can put together the millions of different stereo of the body , and we can put together the components that are offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , because you could have a kid , you &apos;d have to put the phone out of the age of mommy bell .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
one episode was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have a very infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- the middle of the center , and the other thing that &apos;s like , and taskrabbit , and taskrabbit .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that , you can &apos;t have seen it in your business , you can be sure that you &apos;ll soon be .
and what it does is it &apos;s bringing people to the business and to ask this question .
now , you know what the answer is to this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life , which is very much more important than buying objects , the same explosion of choice is to be true .
health care -- it &apos;s not the case in the united states that you &apos;re going to go to the doctor and tell you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could do a do or we could make b .
a has this benefits and risks .
b has this benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a has this benefits and risks and b , and b has the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not it . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift of responsibility is a burden of responsibility for someone who knows something -- -- the patient &apos;s doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like them and me , if they think about it , not any sense of making sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , you &apos;re expecting to call the doctor on the next morning and ask a change of the prescription .
so something so profound as our identity is now a question of choice , how this slide is supposed to show .
we don &apos;t preach identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re so often reinventing ourselves as we want .
that means that every day , if you wake up the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where the most common one was that almost everybody had one and that they were so fast , and then they got so fast , and then they got so fast kids like they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that .
now , all of this is easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry ?
should i marry later ? should i have kids , or do i have a career ? &quot;
these are all the questions that are all about .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions regardless of whether that means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m going to give you and not get a good grade in my class .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important questions to be asked .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl showed , with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every single day of every single day on the planet -- until the most salient hotel .
there &apos;s a corner of the way that i &apos;m not going to tell you about the most important thing that i &apos;m going to do .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have to make decisions , again , and again , and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can watch our kids playing football , and we have our mobile phone on one hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and even if you &apos;re all off , every minute we &apos;re going to ask our child to cut a child &apos;s smoking , we &apos;re also asking , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; is it certainly going to be your experience of the child &apos;s experience , and it would have been very different .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , is a question of choice .
and the world we lived in was this .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world we &apos;re living in now is this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to do something bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , a way of making it , is that he &apos;s going to be able to get out of it .
so with so many options you can choose , people will be very hard to decide to be .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this , a study about investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to the top of the computer , the giant , giant , of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 year-old worker offered the employer to take a half percent .
they offer 50 more of them -- 10 percent less employees , if they only offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 more , which is to be the choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide that you should put it on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never come .
you know , that &apos;s not just called the people eating food when they go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to swim , it means that they &apos;re going to make a lot of the decisions that they &apos;re missing .
they &apos;re not going to be in participation by the $ 5,000 dollars a year on the top of the day , who would have been happy to reproduce their contributions .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
and i think it &apos;s going to make the world look like this .
they want to make the decision really , if it &apos;s for all the eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment , or even the wrong thing .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end up with less content with the outcome of choice than we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is that it &apos;s a lot of choices , and it &apos;s a lot of different types of different forms of time when you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is a complete thing , it &apos;s just a different
the more opportunities there are , the more simple it is not to regret that , that &apos;s disappointing for the choice they meet .
second , what economists call the &quot;
dan gilbert made a big point today by telling how much the way we evaluate things , depends on what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s very many alternatives to remember , it &apos;s just attractive properties of alternative , which you &apos;re arguing about , that makes you less happy with the alternatives that you &apos;ve chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for the one of you who are not new york , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . you have it all for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; damn &quot; man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my neighborhood is gone .
i could park directly from my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks of the thought that he missed the possibility of day , day a great parking parking .
so , the happiness of happiness is that we get the satisfaction that we get through our choices , even if what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more opportunities to be the choice , the more attractive properties of these choices are going to be in the most violent .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon makes some statements .
he &apos;s going to make a statement about it now , and maybe things slow down to do things .
but a more important point that he &apos;s doing is always who you decide to decide , you don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things like a lot of attractive properties , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do less .
third : the expectation of expectations .
this was what i met when i was going to exchange my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost the whole time .
and there was a time in that it was just a kind of jeans , and they bought them , and they have bad news , they were incredibly adept , and they were incredibly fond , and they had been beaten up , they started &quot; ok .
so , to buy new jeans after many years of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the salesmen said , &quot; do you want to be a benign , easy , or wide ?
do you want the buttons or a bust ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you want to cut down the bottom , and you &apos;d like to blah , blah , blah , and so on , he said .
my jaw was down and after i recovered , i &apos;d like to have the way that the only way that we had the only way .
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour with all of these damn jeans , and he got the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best jeans i had ever had .
i had better . all these choices allowed me to have better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it myself .
the reason that i felt bad was to have all these available possibilities , my expectations for what a good few jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations when they were only in a kind of way .
when they came in 100 ways , damn , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i had to get to what i expected , and what i had was a bit of a thought of what i expected .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s increasing by possibilities in people &apos;s lives , and the people are increasing the expectations of how well they will be .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because if you would , you know , you don &apos;t know what it is .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is , the sooner was better than anything worse than anything was worse , it was possible for people to make a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world we live in -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best for you can ever hope to be the things that you might expect to do .
they &apos;re never going to be comfortable because their expectations , my expectations , are big .
the secret to the computer -- that &apos;s what they all came up with -- the secret to the most low , are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short moment of time -- i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have better . i didn &apos;t have a lot of time .
but triple , it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of a bad sit sitting jeans when there &apos;s only one kind of buying a way to buy it , and you &apos;re wondering why , who is responsible , and you ask why , who is responsible , the world is responsible . what
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy a disappointing , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to be the question : you .
they could have better do it .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , if people make decisions , and even if the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant -- not the only , but a significant thing to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced the because they &apos;re so high , and then they have to be able to think of their fault .
and so the most important thing is that it &apos;s generally better , and we feel more objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official state of the day that we all think of right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question , which is better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow , but it doesn &apos;t follow more choices than something .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time , that we have a good way to do that .
now , as a matter of question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a rule of question , which is about thinking about the thinking of what all these choices allow in the industrialized societies , is the material wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them , whose problem is not too big .
your problem is that you have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry is , steve levitt has told you yesterday about how this expensive and hard car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
they &apos;re actually hurt .
they &apos;re worried about that we &apos;re not standing there .
if something that makes people make our society make decisions that people have to make decisions in the societies that people have to do , not only would be improving the lives of people , but we would also improve our dignity .
economists call this a more powerful application .
so , the point is that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all these big choices are shrinking .
finally , you read this cartoon , and , you know , a sophisticated person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know nothing in this kind of thing . &quot;
impoverished imagination , a world &apos;s view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view of the fish .
because the truth is that if you break the most , so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the water , so that everything is possible , it &apos;s lower .
they increase the paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a computer service .
this is almost with perfect security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the most important thing is that the most complex is a recipe for misery , and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new lives and build .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask significant questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve been digitized almost 20 years . when we sequenced the climate change , the change of the analog world of biology is the digital world of biology .
now we &apos;re trying to ask whether we can regenerate life or whether we can make new lives , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma , which has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we tried to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it on about a hundred genes of the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at these metabolic map that is very simple , compared to our own . trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we &apos;re all looking at these genes we can eliminate one of the other things that we can eliminate after the other
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to go forward to the front of this chromosome , actually , to vary the individual components and to ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we get a chromosome ?
does it allow the chemistry to make these really big molecules , which hasn &apos;t been done before ?
and , if we can , can we start the chromosome ?
one chromosome is just a piece of a piece of chemical material .
our steps in the superconductor were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code is very slow , but yet , our final point would be now on an exponential curve .
we started with 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years of a review of a review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out that it &apos;s very difficult to do .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters , but it &apos;s a very , a process of power , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new method with that little pieces that we could put together and correct the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x .
it &apos;s a little virus of bacteria killing .
we made small pieces , made a error error and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of chemical chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then released by the cells , and they came back and killed e. coli .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said they understood this model exactly .
they laughed more than they do here .
so we think that this is a situation in the software that can actually build your hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole kind of a whole chromosome chromosome , and it &apos;s more than a more powerful letter of genetic code , and we thought we could build it in tapes of the virus , which is
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information really has to be accurate .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the most powerful one was a 10,000 base base base .
we found the most of the time , and when we had used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to make pieces that are 50 letters long and to overlap with other people &apos;s pieces of work to build smaller amounts of light that fit these .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built a lot of the air .
think about it : we have a design code : a , c , g and t.
so , the letter of this letter -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids ; there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we just signed up just signed .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we &apos;ve designed the pieces that we could just put them with enzymes , and there are enzymes that are fixing these and then bring them back .
and we started making pieces , starting with the pieces of the five to the five to the letter of these two to make these together , to put together these together , to put together these things , until the back of the time .
in every step we &apos;ve produced these pieces in the surplus that we could sequence them because we tried to create a very robust process of what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get the point of the design .
so , this looks like a computer model .
if we get to these right pieces -- with 100,000 pairs of wood -- then these aren &apos;t just growing in e. coli , and it &apos;s all the way we &apos;ve been doing other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism called the design of the world &apos;s process , which uses biology to repair dna that can bring these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s a organism called the most powerful , the three million rads of radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything has been put together like it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely dried , they can even live in the vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life exists in space and can move to the search of aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a video of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve used the only design of the pieces of the pieces of pieces , we have it automatically used to do it . yeast then adds this automatically together .
this is not a regular , a regular computer .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the most sophisticated .
these are footage about a long time of six seconds .
that &apos;s the publication that we &apos;ve just done recently .
these are about the letters of the letters of the code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with the fabric of the structure that has ever been created by people .
it has a more 300 million .
if we would print it with a more 10 and without distances , it would be able to include the pages of pages , just to get this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s a very simple thing to do with a virus , and it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier if you &apos;re in the way we &apos;re doing it , you just take the nucleus out and you have another inside , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about cloning .
in the cell , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but only recently we &apos;ve shown that you can do a full transplant of a cell to another and that activate it .
we were displaced the chromosome of a laser , roughly , and they &apos;re like these two , and we were able to pick up a few of them as people and mice , and we could select some of the proteins that we could pick up with all
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that there is the end , but we tried to get the process to get something further .
this is the most popular of evolution here .
we all find species of species here , or a third chromosome , or a third of the world &apos;s worth of oil , every time thousands of characteristics in just a second to a species .
so people who think of evolution as a gene is changed a lot of the biology .
there are enzymes called the most sophisticated , which is actually dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no one ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve added .
it was made in the cell , and it realized the other chromosome as alien material , and we had just a cell with a new chromosome .
it &apos;s the blue because of the genes that we put in .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species and converted completely into a new species based on the new software that we have in the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we have .
it may sound like genomic design , but we can , by moving the world &apos;s energy , things quite dramatic .
now i argued that this is not the most important -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i &apos;ve argued that we may be able to create a new form of the cambrian explosion in which it could be massive new , new design systems based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re in the next 40 years of nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet are in 1946 for every year , in 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
it will offer a challenge for nine .
we need about five billion tons of coal , and we need to have a hundred million barrels of oil , and that &apos;s a hundred million barrels per day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace it , it will be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 of this material growing in the atmosphere .
we now have the world from all the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the most important of the future .
the most powerful thing had a dozen components and see the diversity of that .
we &apos;re first going to go into the limits of biological reality and to those of our notions .
we have technologies today because of these fast fast things to do what we call the genetics .
we now have the opportunity to build a big robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine making these 20 million different genes or to optimize these processes to make the fossil vaccines , or drugs , we can change a little team more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just selection selection . we can go to the search of chemicals , production of chemicals or the water , and so on .
this is a shot of real time that we &apos;re working with , which is actually where you &apos;re actually going to sit and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to look like it . we know exactly how to look at the genetic code .
we &apos;re now focusing on fuel of the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn ethanol recently , which is just a bad experiment .
we have fuel of the world &apos;s energy and third generation that will be relatively soon coming out of the much higher , as inflation or different species of the brain .
but , as we think , the only way of biology is a big impact without any more increase in food or the limitation of their availability , if we see co2 as a result , and so we &apos;re working on cells that go to this path .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all kinds of different ways .
this is a organism that we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about a month , about a month , in almost a long time , in almost a fashion .
it &apos;s turning co2 into methane to use hydrogen as a source of hydrogen .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use carbon dioxide , which could just be brought into the carbon , which could be made of carbon dioxide , to push the co2 into fuel .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- we have -- we have -- we have a lot of goals like the replacement industry of the entire dose of industry . right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where else ?
but we &apos;re working on this right now , the same way to use the same approaches for the development of vaccines .
you saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year back and have a dollar to make a dollar when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by creating vaccines in the world &apos;s brain .
this is what the future might look like with changes , can be accelerated today , with synthetic bacteria , and perhaps , potentially , the most powerful .
we &apos;re a light of light from people to improve it . our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
and on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s like , and for all those who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that was ever been addressed -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that exist less than a second second of the universe -- and that to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we take images of these online images in detectors .
i &apos;m working on this . he &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 feet in the diameter , 22 meters in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction process that you see the scale .
at the 10th of september last year , the machine was going to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it &apos;s caused huge amounts of control in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first time that the entire track around the lhc would be able to get to a part of the lhc , to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture at the 10th of september , we knew that the machine works , what a big triumph is .
i don &apos;t know if this was created the biggest world &apos;s largest , or that , as someone who was visiting google and the front page .
it means that we have a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires here -- this golden wires here here .
these wires lead to the surface of the machine when the machine runs on the ground .
now , the engineers under them will look at them and say , &quot; no , no , they don &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you &apos;re very cool , you &apos;ll be able to call it a little bit of cool .
so , in minus , carefully , it &apos;s colder than the space between the stars , can be able to get these wires to the tension .
in one of the connections between the world &apos;s surface , there was a little bit of a sudden .
and so , it &apos;s a little bit of heat , and they &apos;re going to get a little bit of electric resistance , and suddenly , electric resistance .
this was the result .
now , this is still amazing when you imagine that the magnets weigh over 20 tons and shifted around 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we called them new , they &apos;re called the water .
they &apos;re all back to their way back .
and the lhc is going to be more viable to march .
we &apos;ll turn it down , and we &apos;re going to collect the first data in june or july , and we &apos;re going to go on to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in a way that accidents are about the debate of science and engineering on these boundaries , it &apos;s easy to reject something .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to reach the fact that we &apos;re going to reach beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words to a english scientist , and i &apos;m going to leave you with a english scientist , which i suspect when he was attacking the most powerful experiments of his brain &apos;s life , his apprentice was michael &apos;s , which
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
books are my job , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big life , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that that ever will change .
but a recent thing is a recent thing in my life , and my career has happened to be completely able to rethink my relationship to this work .
this strange event was that i recently wrote a book -- a biography called a biography called the &quot; aw &quot; -- , love , love -- that , decided to get different books from some reason in the world , and a big , international , international ,
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to get treated as if i was going to the end of the end .
seriously -- the fall of the end .
for example , you get to me , and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you will never be able to be able to be able to get this success ?
don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re going to make your whole life and never create a book that anyone in the world is interested in ? never again ?
okay , that &apos;s really what makes you courage .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was going to be a teenager about 20 years ago when i was a teenager for the first time , i was told that i was a writer with the same kind of reaction .
people said , &quot; do you have no fear of having no success ?
did you not fear that the humiliation of a letter kills you ?
have you no fear that you &apos;re going to be able to make your life for your life and never get something and you &apos;re going to die on a plane of the dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : yes , yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i had always been .
and i &apos;m afraid of fear that nobody would be a clue .
like algae -- and other scary things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it , and i ask myself , why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that someone should be expected to do the work that he feels to do ?
and what &apos;s the same thing about the creative enterprise , that they &apos;re going to make us insecure about the other mental state -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemists and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist , which he asked if he was afraid to be chemists .
with your favorite , john -- how about it ?
it just didn &apos;t come to know , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not given the reputation of the u.s. &apos;s call of the people .
we have a writer of this kind of call , but not only the writers , but the creative of all the metaphorical , seem to be this reputation , mentally unstable .
everything you need to do is look at the bitter , really great head of really great head from the 20th century , who died young and often from their own hand .
and even the ones who didn &apos;t actually have been working on their talents , really neglected from their talents .
norman ornish said a little bit about his death in his last interview : &quot; every one of my books has killed me a little bit further . &quot;
a extraordinary statement that you can do about your life &apos;s life .
but we &apos;re not even a little bit of a bit of saying , if we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve heard this kind of talk for so long . somehow we &apos;ve been able to breathe the notion and collectively accepted that creativity and suffering
the question i want to ask today is : is this idea for you completely in order ?
feel that ? because with only one centimeter , i &apos;m not feeling at all .
i find them out of the way .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how they &apos;ve taken into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we encourage our big creative commitment .
and i definitely know that it &apos;s for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , start to start this dark path of the idea of the most powerful path -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career right now .
that &apos;s -- look : i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 more of my favorite .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now from the world is being made by the work that came to the end of my last book , right ?
i say it &apos;s a little bit of a friend , because we &apos;re all kind of friends -- it &apos;s very likely to be my greatest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that you can get to the person to go to nine o &apos;clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to .
i would rather keep doing this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of the most popular , i seem to be able to write , to continue to write a kind of a kind of a psychological engineer .
somehow , i have to find a way to write a safe distance in writing a safe distance between me and my very natural , very natural , as the reaction will be on the writing .
while i &apos;ve been looking for models for the last year , i &apos;ve been looking for the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they might have better or more or more of the ideas to be able to deal with the
this is a search of me in the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will end up again .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of debilitating , which was from a distant , unknown source of people -- from the most of the time , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these divine folk agents of creativity , the divine demons .
from socrates , he &apos;s known that he believed he had a little bit of a sudden he had a lot of time to put it on .
the roman had the same idea , called the kind of , of the creative creative spirit , a computer genius .
this is great . the roman thought didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly smart individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical creature , which was believed that it was literally in the walls of a football -- about how much like the most powerful , the most powerful , the most invisible and the artist &apos;s work would be invisible
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s this , because it &apos;s the distance i talked about -- the psychological construction that &apos;s going to protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked like this , right ?
the artist &apos;s artist was protected by some things , like , for example , too much , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at everything for you , everybody knew you had this kind of thing that was made of this kind of genius that helped you .
if your work is going to work -- not entirely your fault , right ?
everybody knew your genius was something paralyzed .
so people in the west really thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance came and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- about all gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no room for the mystic creatures
it &apos;s the beginning of rational humanism and people started to believe that creativity was completely from their individual individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people who are calling this or a genius -- instead of that he has a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a naked person to allow him to think , or she &apos;s like the vessel , like the pelvis and the essence and the source of all divine , creative , unknown mystery , is a little bit of responsibility to make a human
it &apos;s like asking somebody to eat the sun .
the emperor and distorted whole egos and it creates all these milestones of success .
i think that this is the last 500 years of the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question : is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe to go back to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creative return .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just eliminate the most rational , 500 years of rational humanism in a single talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would be really exposed to scientific doubt about the notion of -- basically -- -- -- the most powerful , people who are acting and so on their projects .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to call is : why not ?
why not think about that ?
because it makes a lot of sense as much as anything i &apos;ve heard about when it was about explaining the absolutely crazy thing of the creative process of the creative process .
a process that -- like every one knows that it &apos;s ever tried to do something -- so in other words , everyone here -- not always , always , is not always useful .
in fact , it can feel really more accurate .
i had recently met a encounter as i met the extraordinary american poet , which now is about 90 , but she was all the way to the whole life , but she told me that she was growing up and hear how a poem was growing on the
she said it would be like a train train .
the land on them would be on their own .
she felt if it came , because it would bring the earth under her feet to the quake .
she knew she could just do one of these things , and that was -- in her words -- in her words -- the devil race , like the devil .
she ran like the devil to the house while she was following this poem , and it was just that she had quickly enough to get a sheet of paper and a pen , so she could get it through her , and put it on the sheet .
in other words , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house and she was going to put it through the house , and she said it would be a little more like a country , and
and then there were these moments -- the part i never forget -- she said that there were moments in which they were almost stuck .
so , she goes to the house and looking for paper and the poem through her and she reaches a pen just as it goes through her and then -- she said -- she was like this with her other hand after that , and he would get it
she caught the poem on his tail and she moved back into her body and took it on the sheet of paper .
and this is the poem that was completely intact , and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
when i heard that , i thought that &apos;s extraordinary -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going on .
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a computer designer . i &apos;m going to have to get up to the same time , and i just sweat to the same time , and i really sweat , and really awkward .
but even i have this thing to tweet in my favorite room sometimes .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
even i had work or ideas that made out of a source of mine that i really can &apos;t identify .
what is this for a thing ?
and how do we get to lose with no idea of our minds , but to keep ourselves in the opposite of the world ?
for me , the best living example , how to do this can be tom &apos;s musician , and i was allowed to interview him a few years ago for a magazine .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of his life was tom &apos;s embodiment of the embodiment of the modern artist , trying to do this kind of thing that was in the world , and to be involved in them .
but then he became older and quiet . he told me that he was going to go to a highway in los angeles , and there was everything that changed for him .
he drove up with high speed as he suddenly hears a little fragment of a melody that &apos;s often , in inspiration , for him , and he &apos;s very hard to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil .
so he starts to get these old , old , like , like , i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;ll be able to get out of this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t make it .
but instead of getting into panic , he just heard .
he ended up doing all the time and did something completely new .
he just looked at the sky and said , &quot; sorry , can you see that i &apos;m driving car ? &quot;
so , i &apos;m looking at this as if i could just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a moment of time , if i can take care of you .
if not , you know , somebody else &apos;s .
go and pop leonard cohen .
his whole process has changed after that .
not the work itself . it &apos;s still a lot of dark as usual and ever .
but the process and the heavy , the heavy , which surrounds him was , when he took the genius out of the place , where he was not allowed to be in trouble , and he left where he was in the way he was going . he
it could give a strange , surprising , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the strange , physical thing that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit like i worked and it had saved me once .
this idea saved me as i was in the middle of the middle of the street of the street , and i was in the middle of the world &apos;s office , and i fell in one of these these these these these these these these these these these
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just be able to do this project .
but then i remembered how tom had spoken in the free sky , and i tried it .
so i took my view from the manuscript and i talked to my comment towards a blank corner of the room .
i &apos;m talking about , &quot; listen , you know , you know , you and i know both , if this book is brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i have everything i have , invest . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to pop up here and follow your percentage of the deal .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that ... you know what , then the hell .
i &apos;m going to write on , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you a record that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end of it , it &apos;s like following . centuries ago , in the deserts of the desert , people have gathered into the deserts of the world with holy dances and music that were stopped for hours -- until dawn .
these were a fixed , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , something special happened . one of the actors actually became a very special thing .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen a performance in your life .
it was as if the time was going to be a little bit of time and the dancer , and he did nothing else than he did before -- 1,000 nights before -- but all added together .
and suddenly , he didn &apos;t come into human beings anymore .
it was lit up by the inside , and it &apos;s light down and everything is going to be a divine fire .
when this happened , people knew what that was . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : &quot; aw allah , allah , allah , god , god , god . &quot;
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historical , in the way , when the most popular came to the world &apos;s favorite , they took this practice . the ambulance changed in the course of the centuries of the u.s. rabbit , allah , rabbits , the most powerful , the most powerful ,
if a performer in spain has something impossible , something magical has done : the evidence-based allah , the unions , the divine , the great , poetic , great , did great , and it &apos;s a glimpse of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning when the dancer wakes up and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he doesn &apos;t have a more of a god &apos;s head of god .
he &apos;s just an aging school of a child &apos;s knee , and maybe he will never get back to those heights .
and maybe someone &apos;s name will never call god &apos;s name , if he turns . but what do he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most profound of a creative life of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so full of requests if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence would come from you .
if you may believe that you &apos;re a loan -- from a spectacular source for a time of your life , which is passed on someone else &apos;s time when you &apos;re done with it .
if we start thinking about it , it changes all of this .
so i started thinking and i think that i &apos;m going to work with security in the last few months , while i was working on the book , which is soon -- when the dangerous , frightening , strong , very expected to be accepted of my favorite
what i &apos;ve got to say constantly , if i &apos;m going to get crazy about it , is not fear .
not a moron .
just do your job .
it &apos;s still for your contribution to what he &apos;s like to be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the dumb divine genius , you &apos;re asking you to show you a little bit of wonder , to show a kind of wonder of wonder , then , you know , the kind of wonder .
and if not , dance still dance .
and the other thing that &apos;s called the street , for you , is that it &apos;s all about this .
i believe that and i feel that we should teach this .
so , the most powerful thing ! for you , for you , just for you , just for you to have the mere human love and the most responsible for you to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
so , the math .
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic arctic , the arctic , had the size of the lower 48 states , to have 40 percent of the size of the lower 48 states .
but this doesn &apos;t push very much enough to the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic is the arctic heart of our global health system .
it grows in winter and declining in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a very , very much of what happened in the last 25 years .
the main thing is with red marks .
as you can see , it &apos;s growing up on the dark dark , and this is the annual ice in winter ; it &apos;s the summer .
this is called the &quot; five years old , &quot; five years old , almost like blood , which is from the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here .
this is a problem , because warming is the frozen reason to put the arctic ocean in the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s big amounts of carbon dioxide , which , if it &apos;s going to be done , from microbes to methane .
compared to the whole amount of energy , in the atmosphere , this amount of light could double if we cross this critical point .
already today in some flat lakes in alaska , methane from itself from the water .
professor &apos;s author of walter walter university in alaska is to have another flat lake at a different flat lake last winter .
wow !
you &apos;re fine . the question is , how will it be ?
and one reason is , this enormous heat heat is flowing out of the north .
this is a year of a year .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is the most salient river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the sea level goes up through the sea level , you &apos;re going to get into the ocean .
these rivers take a long time .
the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest largest community on the planet .
last month researchers volunteered that the entire continent has a negative energy system .
and the most popular , the ones that showed up a few of the things that are very strong is very strong in the melt .
this is a 20 feet above , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the most prolific , you see new lakes , which were a few years ago , that was a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their own food team from this .
in the andes , this glacier is the most powerful for this city .
the most sophisticated ones have been expanding .
but if you &apos;re going to go out , most of the water goes down .
in california , a 40 percent reduction of the sierra sea was seen .
this is the most important thing .
and the predictions , as you read them , are serious .
this is the whole world &apos;s most dramatic increase in the world .
and the disasters around the world have never been up in a really highly sophisticated and previously unprecedented extent .
four times in the last 30 years , like in the most prolific .
this is a completely valid thing .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s going to be like .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 all 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific , the american continent west and both of the indian national west , where there is a radical decline of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest one factor for global warming , next to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most nonetheless problem .
the united states is one of the two largest largest , together with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot of other things .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that were taken in the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the most popular and more sophisticated dollars have spent a dollar last last year to promote clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me about something .
to go around christmas , at home , in tennessee , a billion tons of fuel .
they &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is in our entire country of the u.s. economy of america .
this happened to christmas .
one of the commercials of the christmas center was this .
the most powerful thing is a computer , happy fellow .
there &apos;s a skin in the skin and abundance in america , and it helps our economy to grow .
and the most responsible thing is that the most clean thing is going to be clean .
he &apos;s affordable and more vulnerable , and workers stay in loans and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful thing is the head of the computer &apos;s head .
let me tell you a very clear thing . al gore , nancy forbid , harry dunlap , you don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection has been called two campaigns .
this is one , part of her .
in the process of climate change , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
so we have a second to put it on the top of the world , a significant major health system to bring a more significant way to get the truth to the truth of coal .
the fact is , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s also good still smells of it .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
let &apos;s leave that quiet .
and coal coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean , clean .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean water .
and yet , the burning of coal is one of the main reasons that the global warming is , which is remarkable clean , which you see here , changes everything .
look at it right now , this is the today , clean water .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of the national security .
america is in a crisis that is the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread , which all connects this , is our dependence on the fossil fuels like dirty coal and oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us from this kind of thing .
the americas with 100 percent clean electricity in the next 10 years , within the next 10 years .
a plan , america to work back to work , make us safer and help stop the global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
the americas are new . find more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a u.s. bank of america .
one of the fastest ways of our dependence on old , dirty fuels that are poisoning our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to make good pay jobs .
and it &apos;s new america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
we have to come far , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start with you to ask the time of your childhood , when she played with the computer .
while they realized how to cut the hands and get them off , they actually learned the way they were taking and move , and they actually learned to solve problems and change problems through understanding and change .
the spatial thing is closely connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- with my favorite friends , and my colleagues , i started to wonder , what if we were using computers , which is , if we could use computers , which is a digital
this question was so moving that we decided to explore the answer and we &apos;ve developed the answer .
and i &apos;m a very short computer in the size of a computer , a very interactive computer in the size of a computer .
you can move with your hand , you can see each other , you can detect your movements and you have a screen and a computer camera .
much more importantly , are physically , why you can only move it through the hands of hands and access to your hands .
and the most important one is an example of a new generation of the world &apos;s media data .
and if these tools are going to be physical and a conscious awareness for their movements , each other can recognize and the intricacies of our own experience with them , then we can start with the exploration of new and entertaining .
i start with some simple examples .
this is the most powerful thing for the most powerful , and if i put it in a direction , the video is going to play forward , and when i go to the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other true .
so if i put them side-by-side , they make it interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the way you &apos;re surrounded , you can see that and you can get a little nervous .
and they feel also their movements and bend .
a interesting episode of interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures on data , like color to get the way to do this with fluid .
in this case , we have three main centers as a nuclear scientist , and i can use them to put color in the middle of the middle , where they &apos;re going to mix .
if we &apos;re going to stop it , we can do a little bit of a little bit more .
there are also some nice opportunities in education as languages , math or engineering , where we give people the opportunity to give the fast trial and the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci series that i &apos;m making with a simple kind of light .
this is a game with words that is kind of a mixture of a mixture of a mixture of the brain .
basically , you get every round of every round of your head , and you &apos;re trying to make words , and you &apos;re trying to make words , you &apos;re going to spend this over a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , it &apos;s got a new set of wood and new opportunities to try and try and try and do new opportunities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came to a trip to the media lab , and i could move them to try and take a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact of this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
everything you have to say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest , the youngest of the day .
it turns out he wanted to just stack the world &apos;s license .
so for him , they were just just more restrained .
this is a interactive computer system .
we wanted to develop a design system for a design system .
this is a &quot; aha . &quot;
he can bring new characters into the scene by putting the laser off the table , showing that character .
here he is going to make the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he &apos;s going to take a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the most ugly and it can put them side-by-side , he can make the characters interact ...
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end and he can decide how to evolve .
flying cat .
the last example i &apos;ve been doing today is to show you a little bit of a time of design , which we &apos;ve developed recently , and in the process of the sound as a sound , like the sound of the , bass and drums .
each one has four different variations ; you can select which you want to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can put in any pattern .
and you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a time by holding a laser on a plane .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filters .
you connect it with a certain note and then it tends to be a marker .
and then more sophisticated effects like speed and volume that you &apos;re doing on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s look at .
we start to put the most sophisticated in two main fields in two main fields and put these in a series , and add a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something else to do .
and now i &apos;m going to hook up the filter with the drums , so i can control the effect of life .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by the speed of the pace in one direction or another .
and now i &apos;ll hook up the filter with the bass ; for something more expression .
i can put the sequence in it as you can change .
so i don &apos;t have to plan it in the front of it , but can improvise ; they &apos;re extending or lower .
and finally , i can put the whole sequence by looking at the most sophisticated .
thank you .
so as you can see , my desire is to develop new , new forms of design that are better to fit the way our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new kind of new design and some of the possibilities that we work in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you on the way is that we &apos;re at the threshold of this new generation of interaction technology to interact with digital media , which is the information that we have in our world .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking forward to all of you !
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m very happy to say that i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what should be a good thing ?
i just have to step back to a little bit , and it &apos;s been busy with the modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been studying a few years of the ted project , and i &apos;ve started to do that because i just wanted to know , and i wanted to do it even more , and i wanted to do it in the
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter of the matter .
i think that the molecular biology in general now is speaking , so it &apos;s all about biotechnology , all you count , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now , it &apos;s extremely important , and much more importantly , it will be in the future .
there &apos;s so controversial things like this all changed plants on the top of the ocean .
there are craig venter now in the u.s. bank trying to make the gas , so gas from algae .
and then there &apos;s also things that are totally in the day-to-day life , which is most people not consciously , but for example , the most people who allow us to wash laundry , are also genetically modified enzymes .
and the list can continue to continue over .
and so from the interest of this technology , i &apos;m just going to keep on the same time .
so what now is a solar-powered ?
most people know the most people who know the most of the people .
computers hack , and then it will always be in the media , yes , the hackers break somewhere and claws and so on .
so this is kind of sad for the most sad , because it doesn &apos;t really happen what they actually started , and what &apos;s actually behind it .
and that &apos;s the most important thing , in the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , and it &apos;s also started the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a very simple thing , which is how things simplify , so any more of the time , a question , and how you can do
and it &apos;s been just taken with software , but there &apos;s also a lot of software in the field , there &apos;s a whole whole kind of thing that &apos;s going to do with the whole kind of light that &apos;s going to do with all kinds of
and now , just in the direction of biology , and i want to take this metaphor that comes from synthetic biology , that biology is actually a key code , because , the most important code is a more abstract code , which is , it &apos;s not
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program and be able to program it , and so you can also find it , and i found that incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper with it .
this actually has only taken two eight really a form of this , these networks .
there &apos;s a lot of the dotcom , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with cooperation in india , but now , in india , or active people everywhere , and now , in the world , have been active .
these are the more artistic approaches , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and collaboration with scientists with scientists , and to ask them to be able to engage with these technologies , and to make it work , and they &apos;re all the way to
but it &apos;s actually about finding such a kind of a kind of a viable access to having a playful deal with it .
and then there &apos;s a little bit of the dotcom cingulate , and it &apos;s called the water .
this is from the most popular network , which is actually more like a forum where you &apos;re going to be talking about and online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical and a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a sudden , and then they &apos;re going to be at the end of the question , and they &apos;re also used to be applied .
and from these networks that have been done all the popular , it has been a scene that i &apos;d like to do just a little bit more easily .
here in the picture on the top , you see the most powerful , which is a kind of a school , so basically a kind of school , a private school , a private school , where everybody can get .
children , old , all kinds of people go to the way they &apos;re just going to be able to put them together , and they &apos;re looking at what can be done when they do this .
here &apos;s a group on the left , and it &apos;s called the one group , which is , but it &apos;s quite a long time .
it &apos;s longer than these other two networks .
and they also have a kind of artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , also , also , and combine it in a pretty much way .
a group of bio-mimicry , which i met a while ago , which is a very , a little bit of a sudden that would like to give the public to the public , which is what they learn in college , and they tried to explain what &apos;s
and i have a lecture on the other picture in copenhagen in the medical museum in the medical museum with a show .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s the most important person , but the only thing that all of the things that all have developed is this fascination of technology .
and what you can do with that and just to be able to get out of society and ask , okay , what do you know what you want to do , you have interest with this , you have interest with it ?
so , okay , to hack biology , you need to kind of have material .
you need biological materials , and you need to have tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
or , what you normally understand under a lab that are kind of like a kind of conceptual machines , extremely expensive , extremely , extremely distance , just for the very high , trained academics with a ph.d. and so on .
and our approach was to say , okay , that &apos;s actually true that you don &apos;t have to do that .
this is actually not necessary because every single one of each other has actually evolved , and that &apos;s actually the most important technology that &apos;s really like most of the most common , that &apos;s really .
and the third thing with this premise with this premise , then , was trying to put brian &apos;s back in england , and then he took a video company , then a computer company , and then , yes , so that it &apos;s a , and it
so every one that &apos;s already a soup of soup that he has left to have been too long , even once .
i &apos;ve tried to go back to my lab , a little bit of scale , and then i &apos;ve got to buy a little bit of ebay on ebay and made a little bit of a bit of a bit of a sudden , so that &apos;s the
now , that should not be a joke , but it &apos;s not .
here in the bottom of the picture , you see the lab , in the field of town , so it &apos;s such a kind of a garage garage with whatever kind of stuff that has been the university of the college , a group in paris , which
and this is a little bit of a sudden , which is also mentioned , and this is a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of molecular biology in the principle of molecular
and yes , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively diverse , so there &apos;s a lot of people who are doing that alone , until the big , big organizations , which are more likely to do in the form of the form of life .
but always always the approach that it &apos;s just going to be and accessible to it .
the first project we &apos;ve done as international group , as we were sort of aware of ourselves , is , right now , there &apos;s a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re now , and we know the people who are always concerned
and then , from the u.n. bank , the founder of the founder , and i said , &quot; well , we have to really meet ourselves , even real meeting , and then two events , and then two events , and then , in the middle of
and then , there &apos;s also about , yes , who are we , what are we going to want , what do we want to do ?
and what are our values and what are our purposes , our foundation ?
and then we have a kind of a full-time job .
this was quite intuitive , so everyone has just so his wishes , his and what it &apos;s going to move to , then , then , .
and i think , i think , a very good code .
and then we have this , and that &apos;s not appropriate , but that &apos;s just , i think , has been pretty good at the time , and people are quite convinced of this .
and we actually tried to bring that back into academic world , but it &apos;s kind of not that way .
so i think we &apos;re in the way that we &apos;re in the way that we have a step further than the academic world .
now , what do we do in projects that are actually doing this ?
a project i did with the most salient in switzerland was that we wanted to create a so-called optical case or optical orphans .
this is , if you focus a laser beam , you can get little particles in the room , and you can get little particles in the air , or in the liquid and then moving into this focus , so that &apos;s what a kind of a kind
this really works , which is done in academic science , and we thought , okay , we might have taken a webcam , then we took a webcam that &apos;s going to be the lens , the lens , the lens , it &apos;s about a microscope that
this is what you see down there .
and then we have a laser torch , and then we pulled the laser out and then tries to focus on this camera .
and that &apos;s not what it did , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of it .
so another project that made out of the french group of paris , that has been shown , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and it &apos;s like this , so this is a kind of a kind of a design , so that &apos;s how it &apos;s a little bit like this , so he &apos;s got to be busy with a little bit of his life , his favorite is sam
he then made this helmet that built this helmet , and in cooperation with the museum , it was gone .
and then the visitors could go in the room , put on this chair , put this helmet on .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought or how they thought , is then different lights in the room .
it was a pretty nice project .
another thing from the united states , which is also with this kind of thing that has been there , is the most sophisticated , which is the kind of fun , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , to reproduce , to reproduce , to reproduce , to reproduce , so you can make it visible .
so if i do that now , the most popular thing that the crime scene , then , go there , collect any more of the time , and then they do this method , and then they can say , okay , this hair is listening to this
and the machines that make this happen is quite expensive , which is pretty expensive to buy the most commercial , the cheapest euro .
and that &apos;s not a lot of the time , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be a lot of .
so this is just a application of many , which you can do with it .
and they have two of these two builders , and they said , okay , we &apos;re doing easier and cheaper , and then we have open source , so open source , and they &apos;re free , and they &apos;re now the cheapest vendor of these devices .
i think that &apos;s a six hundred dollars or something .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s definitely in a frame where it &apos;s going to be clear , but it &apos;s a lot of more available .
so it &apos;s a very , very valid hack .
a project i started to start with was a computer company .
so , the way that you &apos;re doing this is , yes , like a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a , two centimeters or something .
you invites the wooden to be on the ground and then the most powerful , and then i &apos;ve taken the tag on the onion and then put the light on the ground that &apos;s so .
so the device you see there is not working .
but this is my prototype , which was pretty wild , but pretty much , so on a branch that was on the same side , the thing that was on , electronics and pressure , and that was the pressure , but it was the pressure .
and then i took a laser camera and i put it together .
a key thing , if you do the full power with water , the enough pressure , so i think so 40 to the bar , i think , is about it .
and then you can accelerate the particles , and then you go down to the onion , and then you go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about the cost of the euro , or something like this , and the 50 , the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically doable .
so , this is the moment that the core core is just the core of the scene , and that availability of technology and the information and the information and the most powerful , that more people can get involved in there .
because , as i said , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea of it , and also not a chance to make it really good .
because if you &apos;re just reading about it , it &apos;s not the same thing as if you &apos;ve done it yourself or you &apos;ve seen it .
and i think technology is always becoming more important in our modern societies .
and if you can make a good citizen , as well as a informed citizen in society , and you can join , then you need access to knowledge and to technology .
and you have to do it , and you can understand it and understand it .
and then the most open of the open open open and citizen science .
so , you can actually put in the situation that you can get into the situation , and it &apos;s a lot of technology that &apos;s going to be different .
and that &apos;s the core core of the world &apos;s core .
these are the people who have at least officially replaced on the website , the website website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re also represented in southeast asia .
this is me , that &apos;s there , there are fewer people , as actually , in fact , exist .
so i know about some who don &apos;t have to put it up .
and these are just the canadians , the individual people .
and in part , with these kind of predatory spots , these places put together .
and that &apos;s really in the beginning .
like i said , it &apos;s just starting .
and so , the most important , the most popular , because the most popular thing in berlin was the first , the first one .
and this is a gigantic network of very good , yes , and it &apos;s become a lot of good , and that &apos;s all over the world .
and we hope that we &apos;re going to be able to expand and then be similar to the same , and then also , as well as people are involved , they can be involved in the same way .
and i would invite everybody to deal with it and even try and try and do what .
it &apos;s not so simple now , but it &apos;s not impossible , if you have enough curiosity , and you get enough energy , you &apos;ll get there .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hello .
how do we actually work ?
this is a question that &apos;s very moving me as a designer , but also in the realm of the world &apos;s brain , and in front of all the things in the area of user users .
it &apos;s about how to go to the interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and create it as a result of a very , very much more powerful experience .
because i think that the interactive media in us , cognitive models , are engaging , so paradigm that has been in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we can just create the only interactive media .
and this is very amazing because you actually believe that these are the most powerful , which you &apos;ve got to get there , that you actually get the future , but actually it &apos;s that the future is exactly at us , in our own body .
what are the really important models now ?
i &apos;ve been writing four more and a half of the time , and i want to explain to you a little bit about it .
to be cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we have in the pre-industrial times .
to these kinds of models of models , we &apos;ve heard that we have a natural relationship to virtuality .
that sounds like a strange thing .
i &apos;m going to go back to this , and you &apos;ll prove to you by trying to prove that you have a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second aspect is that since this kind of thing we &apos;ve been able to do , we &apos;ve been able to talk very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very ambiguous , even though we
and the third area , actually , explains itself .
we all know that the interactive media is a definition of definition , which contains the denial of the comfort , and what of course tells us that we are now feeling the contradiction today .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of the world &apos;s brain .
now , as it is with virtuality , that &apos;s actually the most basic thing in the world .
i want to show you that .
how many doors did the house be in which they live ?
we can &apos;t immediately answer them , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
they go through the spirit of this house , in the middle of the house , and they &apos;re looking at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they &apos;re the reality and they &apos;re very , very without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and we &apos;re going to be able to make a sense of the virtual reality of the virtual reality in our brain lab , and we can actually do this all the time .
and this wealth that the virtual reality is to be able to do , the reality of the people in the pre-industrial times , had to have a lot of the people in the pre-industrial times , because they had nothing .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any more sophisticated .
they had no mass media .
the only thing that had had her head .
and in this head , the memory was going on .
in this head , the whole thing was known , and with this virtual images , the imagination , the imagination was also passed up .
and so it &apos;s also so strong in us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s what it goes .
the interesting thing about this is that at the same time , the human being was at the same time and medium itself .
now , if you think about a piece of time .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i &apos;m going to talk to you about that again .
the fundamental tool of the world &apos;s brain has been thought of .
and the preacher , priests , so-called the so-called , were more intimidating to keep knowledge in stories .
and we &apos;re still going to be very , very strong in stories .
the author of the book the book of the book , jonathan ornish , we still have a year of the day of stories with the stories of stories .
this means for a child that &apos;s been spent to reach the most of the time of the most of his life with the most of the time of stories .
now we think our love to stories depends on the lap that we have sat on the lap of our parents .
no , no , no , far missing .
this is a lot more back , in the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
but for me , in the field of interactive media as particularly impressive , we have a se in our biological memory , the ability to think of the ability to think .
i brought you an example of the north american tribe of the u.s.
and the lives lived in the most violent of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very , very crude area , and you had to navigate there , from island to island to get food .
and they did this with so-called so-called so-called called the &quot;
you may know , if you &apos;re interested in this , you &apos;re going to be interested in the australian american .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have a drug that &apos;s used , but they &apos;ve used the same as they have , or also the same thing .
and what the interesting thing about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be photographed by songs .
and the language of the language was reflected by the language of the language .
that means you &apos;re going to be a little bit of sound and rhythm .
and these sounds and the rhythm , the geology , the topography of a region , has shown that , of course , that you could have these songs and put it together , and then move back to the left , and then move back to the left
why don &apos;t we sing to get from a to b to a b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
this is what happens to the machine .
we &apos;ve moved to the so-called so-called the so-called &quot; s . &quot;
and this is the project machine , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s the book , and it &apos;s the most important thing .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens , that we have the responsibility for our memories and the ones that have their own power of our individual memories on external media .
on the book , and on the picture .
so unfortunately , we have a piece of god &apos;s play to the very long time .
virtuality has suddenly become alien for us , and it has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous school scientist on the computer &apos;s office , is so far to say that these mass media , he means the book and the image , so not television , the internet , and so on , what we call mass media today ,
let &apos;s make a little bit of a little bit of a video .
from the computer machine to the machine .
what has the impact on our thinking and our memory system ?
then the most important thing is the pre-industrial cultures .
and they &apos;re more and more of the centuries of the centuries of the centuries of the world &apos;s impact .
that means instead of remembering us , we have a rational , widespread , common pattern of memories that we can depend on our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more ourselves .
we have an abstract language of a language .
we don &apos;t think of the thing anymore in images that are not more in pictures , but we &apos;re going to do it with you our language .
we &apos;ve used to get that things that happen linear .
and we have the implications as a law , and there &apos;s only exceptions , like the most important .
what &apos;s left is the most important thing .
still , we &apos;re the most arrested as a very , very strong , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
we had the most salient thing we had , we had the machine machine and we &apos;re going to go to the so-called &quot; the same way . &quot;
it sounds very , very much , and it sounds very , very basic , i know .
but these concepts of the design of the world that bring us back to this possibility of our ability to discover our skills .
there &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about the most cosmopolitan , it &apos;s about the most cosmopolitan .
i want to explain a little bit about this .
there are technical concepts like the augmented reality , which means the extended reality .
so if you look at google , for example , then it &apos;s a concept that makes us combine the virtual world with the real world that is called the virtual world , which is the virtual , natural , natural , to feel again .
another example is that so-called virtual reality .
so , of course , the relationship of my talk may sound , because we &apos;re moving physically in not existing , virtual worlds , all the way to the model of the computer model .
and other examples are the most powerful , smart systems .
these are rooms that can respond to a human being .
all this needs the ability to accept our basic ability , virtuality as a real habitat .
i &apos;ve been in the conclusion and i hope that video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the most powerful of michael &apos;s , and the most powerful , recyclable , and the most powerful , and the most powerful .
and the two of these are also here today .
maybe you can get up to your wake up , so you can talk to the two about the project .
and this project , i brought up as an example , as again , is how again this was going to be , cognitive models .
and the whole thing is , i have to say , &quot; i have to say .
what the hell of course is extremely reactive and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i say computer games , they probably have a very likely to see that any people in front of some people have a little bit of a time , or they &apos;re playing with some of the things that they &apos;re playing with in their hand .
anyway , they do that in the way .
this is a game for outside .
and that &apos;s what i thought is that i discover the outside world , so i discover the real world again .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data that we produce , the real world we produce .
i apologize to that i have to adapt so much .
you can explain that much better , because there &apos;s more than that , there &apos;s more than that .
and it &apos;s about that i discover a city by looking at what places are positive or negative .
and so i get a whole different view of the city , a very different impression , which i see negative and positive zones of a city and getting a whole different , virtual map of a very real city .
and we can now look at this .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you see .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , is clear .
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can make this virtual worlds .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize my talk , and that &apos;s what the characteristics of the qualities and the skills that we &apos;ve been doing from the most responsible , and that we &apos;ve gone to a little bit of a little bit of a bit of
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
i &apos;ve been asked to be if this bag is a bag of bag , and i &apos;m going to talk to you instead of being a bag of a bag .
it won &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m also going to disappear , which is there .
but i just do it as a little bit of curious .
yes , kids are curious about nature or should be curious , designers too .
i &apos;m a creator of house , so i &apos;m also involved with the subject of curiosity and how the curiosity is also changing our thinking , and why we might lose curiosity and have to be more curiosity and so on .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re doing next to the actual existence of the way that you &apos;re doing .
if professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to be in the n of the n .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half year .
a key thing to the subject of natural users interface .
now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself why the whole designers are going to start with so natural , more powerful , interaction , and so on .
and i &apos;m just one of these little devices , because things are always supposed to be more intuitive , always natural , more natural , and there &apos;s a lot of time to look at what &apos;s actually a human , which is a little bit more intuitive
and before the background , i have natural user interface in the field of natural user interface , so the next generation in the human computer is so busy in the relationship of human computers , how our tools are changing or how the computer is changing from the
so i &apos;ve been busy doing this when it &apos;s , of course , or intuitive .
maybe again , a look at it .
why does this happen at all ?
so if we look at the development of our society , here &apos;s a short point , we &apos;re going to move from the third to the fourth , or the fourth of the world .
so from modern in the world .
every society is shaped by a long-term network .
the first thing that the language is about is the language .
that means you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve talked to a common language , you could communicate with each other , and it &apos;s moved into the same cave or in other areas , cities , or villages , has created a way of doing it .
but the most powerful thing was , the language , something very natural , something very natural .
you also had to learn , so no a toddler can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it , of course , and of course .
that was then been fooled by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a computer company , because of course , you started living language in the form of writing , which is what &apos;s called the most powerful and alive , i start to start and put it in stone and i &apos;m also doing it .
depending on how i &apos;m going to go and when i &apos;m going to go , it &apos;s a very different narrative than if there &apos;s a living in the way that you &apos;re alive .
but then , the kind of thing that was going on was that this script was going to be a fan of the book .
then the next generation we actually lived in today is primarily alive .
this is just the pressure and print in the background of the sun , and the other thing .
it was the same as a result of the other thing that the other was , the other thing that the people , and other people have said , are actually really insane when the people start reading , then they want to be a lot of the way
and now we come to the next generation and the exciting , so a little bit of a hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this particular phase phase , that we &apos;re going to get this one .
so , of course , the confused us , because we see the new media , the social media , facebook and so on .
with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what &apos;s going on on the old thinking , don &apos;t tell you that in the most fundamental , and no beef is more or more , or other phenomena , i want to just do that ,
and these two worlds are just going to go together , new and old thinking .
so the exciting thing is , if you look at this , this new society , these kind of things , the most powerful , a lot of mechanisms , principles and the paradigm of the world &apos;s s .
but now not more on local level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the subject of ecology is a global .
not if i think locally , and the neighbor thinks less organic , then it doesn &apos;t work all the time .
that means that the local village is actually a global village with the same principles , of course , and so far , but also the total transparency .
so as you knew in the village , who has what , who has what , and when , this is what happens today , this expansion of our self through this mobile level .
it &apos;s that we know global liberation and faster and more and more and more and more .
so , like it was just on the village , it happened .
so before the background , i just started looking at what &apos;s called , because what &apos;s it for us , what &apos;s the case of what we might have , what &apos;s the difference for us , but what does the difference ?
because often people come to do it , they can &apos;t make it not a matter of the way that everybody can do it .
so you have to engage with what &apos;s called , because it &apos;s not just changing it , but it &apos;s going to be better , but it &apos;s going to be better .
and when of course , what &apos;s intuitive and how i can take a creator to make it feel like this , and just make things like this , that they &apos;re a very intuitive , so they &apos;re very intuitive , and they &apos;re just to use it
you &apos;re going to be busy , as well as the subject of perception and the subject of perception .
and that &apos;s , of course , what you start and look at and look and say , okay , now i just look at the inside of the inner self .
and what &apos;s it like in this ?
so how do we work if we &apos;re going to get there ?
and what does it mean , of course , intuitively and how do our channels work of perception and how does the cognitive processing work ?
because steve jobs once said , you know , you &apos;re going to dig up to dig up to dig up the way to dig it up .
so you really have to look at the details , if i want to make something more intuitive or intuitive , which is what is called the core .
and there you see that you have a our seven senses , most of us think , just five , now , in fact , that &apos;s seven , because it &apos;s certainly the next future , and it &apos;s also the next future , and as an extension
and look at how we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is a difference that is a difference .
many use the word , but not what it means to be very different .
but i have to understand in the core , in the nature of understanding information , when information is going to be information , and from information , so i know how to do things like that , and of course , i can know how to do things
and of course , how design influence the perception .
we see this , if i make things , then i can make them confusing , like on the right , where i don &apos;t know what is salt and pepper , or i can sort of make them intuitive by showing things .
so very much natural , in a dish , but i look at just where salt and pepper is in .
and if i say to someone , i &apos;ll give you salt or pepper , then he &apos;ll think of the right thing , where is it in .
and the left just intuitively access to me , and then hopefully that no sugar is in the salt , the salt just put out of it .
but also our perception itself , as it does , is how it makes us .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks taller than the little , although it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just the same size , and yet our perception is changing , depending on what context we do .
anybody know what that is ?
come on .
the other thing is , it should work .
there &apos;s a little bit more to my glasses .
so it &apos;s n circle .
a second circle starts to be able to manipulate certain similarities or associate .
and then if i hold a more , a little bit more , you can &apos;t see a unit , which is a unit , which is circle , circle and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see a unit , a circle , a
this is called the &quot; you know , &quot; or you &apos;re just going to be able to get us into perception , which is also influenced by perception .
so , for the creator , the most important semester , the great semester , the great news .
so , the way that we have the continuity of the continuity and so on .
and then often , again , forget again .
but this is essential to a vital part of the way that you want to make things equally intuitive .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting , is the view of this .
so , sounds very banal , but it &apos;s very exciting , but it &apos;s very exciting when you &apos;re going to be busy .
so we have the eyes on the front , and now you think we &apos;re looking at the back of the front .
that &apos;s wrong .
you can see from the back to the front .
because they &apos;re a assumption to the front of the front that they see something that they recognize , the circle of the circle .
that means we &apos;re only seeing our view of our view before we see it , and then we see it back to the back of our online system , to say , okay , okay .
i have this kind of cognitive design , you have what you want to see .
and that &apos;s then there , then again , coming back .
then it goes back to the front , because the back of the back is not the back and says , well , look at it , please , look at what you &apos;re seeing , and sure , what you want to see is what you want to
and then it goes back to the back and then it &apos;s actually just seen .
so a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very busy process .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s known from you this picture .
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve described .
now , everyone &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s going to recognize what &apos;s going on .
does anybody see something special ?
a computer system , right .
if i saw that , that &apos;s a little bit of a time in there , you know that .
you &apos;ll never forget about it , because i &apos;m going to show you where the most important thing is .
now you see the most salient .
and then , you see , you &apos;re always seeing it .
so , i &apos;ve actually got them to be stuck in the process of being there , that they don &apos;t recognize any patterns , but i have them in a very short time , again , again , again , this dog in this obscure picture .
and this is the projection of seeing this projection , and it &apos;s a look at it .
now i know , and now i &apos;m going to go forward to the front of the day that i see the most salient .
i see the most salient .
so , very exciting processes that then , in this , is , yes , gray is actually not , but here in this particular mass of mass , it &apos;s just going to happen in this kind of light .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know something three seconds , until i kind of look at the present in the world , i can also bridge very well , and i can also bridge it very well in which i &apos;m doing a little bit of time .
it &apos;s just got to process it as a present .
then it goes into the past and so i can bridge very elegant , for example , on the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
what does it take to get milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
it &apos;s a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time that you &apos;re in love with .
that means , you know , if you know that , you &apos;re looking at who you look at , because i don &apos;t get a gun for what you can do , because i &apos;m not going to get a gun for what &apos;s going on .
and 16 milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time of most of the perceptions we have .
that means that this first impression is happening in a rapidly fast speed , as we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at and how we &apos;re kind of defending ourselves against our environment , so we can think about it .
of course , the creator of the subject is not just the issue of perceptions and neural control or the most effective , but primarily with the subject of the world &apos;s brain .
so , like a human being , it &apos;s about things like this .
there &apos;s a practical thing that &apos;s practical , so that &apos;s the kind of thing that &apos;s so versatile or more of the things .
there &apos;s a lot of time where i know exactly where i have to reach .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why does someone have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a time , where no matter what &apos;s going on , so that it &apos;s not so much more powerful , so that it &apos;s not
we &apos;re more on symbolic , on the top of the brain , which we &apos;re also concerned with as a creator .
back to my actual topic of natural users , and the subject of what , of course , is the most powerful thing , is the most powerful .
and the way that i can do it is , as i can do , i can get a certain goal , or how can a user in a certain sense of energy can be effective , efficient and and , &quot; a goal . &quot;
so it &apos;s like the norm .
how do i make something like that ?
i can do that directly or i need to do &quot; n manual or i need &quot; a training of this . &quot;
and less , or more , it &apos;s a lot of the time .
that i &apos;m just making that differently and make beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that too .
and then if you &apos;re in part of the software that we &apos;ve seen , you &apos;ll see , you know , why 99 percent of our software is intuitive or not to use the software of the software , and it &apos;s not based on the most sophisticated
and it &apos;s intuitive , not only for apple &apos;s first known , a fundamental problem , a fundamental problem , when i want to use technology to use the human devices .
why ?
because in the rule of the world , we &apos;re using this new kind of energy , which is the natural user , for example , five times faster in our goal .
you have to imagine that if you do something of classical design , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software , only one hour is still an hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you probably can go home four hours , but your employers , or somebody , will fall to the way he &apos;s doing it with the four hours .
but i want to say that it &apos;s a more important thing for us to do , of course , to make some things .
and then when we go back to the realm of software , here &apos;s the first time the first line of interface that were very abstract , where you took months to deal with these systems .
then the next one , the next thing that we &apos;ve seen with &quot; the &quot; doc neural model , &quot; has been working on the software , which is , you know , you have a notion of something that metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop ,
so no longer zeros and ones or the code of code , but just a metaphor .
it &apos;s a lot of the time , but it &apos;s also a lot better , but it &apos;s also a lot better .
the next generation of the conversation is working very much more with behavior .
so , i &apos;m making a lot more often than a creator , as a result , as a result .
this is also a paradigm shift .
so , i think that &apos;s always the way that i think that &apos;s going to be a application for success , just the most powerful one .
and then if i go to a step of this natural user , the user user interface , where i &apos;m a voice , by language , by touch , by gesture and a mouse , and not more of mouse and cursor , i &apos;m still more faster
but that &apos;s also what leads me to the point , when are things going to be intuitive ?
if you &apos;re more intuitive and then i have to get out of my little friend here , and see what does it mean , because of the point of view , when is it really intuitive ?
and that &apos;s for us to be a little bit intuitive , and i think it &apos;s always a little bit intuitive about it .
so he doesn &apos;t like to think , but it just does not want to do it .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for designers ?
that means that if we can look at existing food systems from one on something else , for example , the metaphor can be used , i can do it as a creator .
that means i can just transmit a intuitive human health system on a software and make the software significantly more powerful .
and of course , the question is , what is the most important thing about us , and now i &apos;ve been telling you .
this is called the so-called &quot; the call . &quot;
and that &apos;s what everybody &apos;s using , and we &apos;re using a acronym and is a acronym , and it &apos;s for a profit , and it &apos;s a very , very popular , mental , science .
it &apos;s all of you all the time , but it &apos;s kind of unconscious and it &apos;s kind of intuitive or also instinctively .
the model is already going to be a lot of the time in the womb and is a lot of the time , so it works in the world at young and old , and it &apos;s used by us all the time without most of the time that
and the other thing that &apos;s going to be about 50 to a half is about 50 to a half of us , so in the sleep , you &apos;ve noticed that it &apos;s less often more often than the day .
i can now get this mental pulse of mental workload , and i can get to the root of a car , and i can get a handle on a computer scanner .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the world &apos;s metaphor , now not more a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a design of a brain , a computer system .
and this is on a higher grail of the world &apos;s transmission as the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the most prolific .
and if i &apos;m going to go to the point of view , for example , i &apos;m going to be able to get a look at the same as a result , and i think , in the case , it &apos;s going to be big to me
then i can transmit the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to do this by a quick one .
and it &apos;s just a cake that everybody has eaten .
and so , in the case , i &apos;m going to interact with the object , and again , i can zoom back to the object again .
i &apos;m going to get the whole whole point of view , now , and can say , show me all the things about chocolate .
and once on a , what &apos;s much more intuitive and very much more natural .
because , because i can reach the things like the bits , and they can come to me , and they &apos;re much more natural than if they can do it , and they can make it more natural than the kind of stuff that can make these things
imagination is more powerful , more sophisticated , and with this sentence , i want to close to a and again , a and again , designers , to think differently , to come to new solutions , and thank you very much for your attention and please .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first , if you &apos;re a kid , as a baby , is that you &apos;re going to take a drum , which is what you have , right ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed you to play more or less in the most ,
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn to learn .
so all of that is , you know , these are the ones that are curious , and people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m now about this whole thing , basically , this whole thing , the whole , 40 years of doing it , in quality of the quality .
and there &apos;s a central point in this .
and it depends on phosphorus .
give a chance .
every day they give them a scale of magnitude , they have to take a scale of phosphorus , and every day they have to take two grams phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could just glide as a representative of the sun &apos;s book .
if we did not take phosphorus , and we &apos;re going to go .
amazingly , it &apos;s that we &apos;re going to deal with something that is actually a little bit of a time , but not that .
because all of you talk about energy , but nobody talks about the most important .
the most critical thing is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have for two years of phosphorus and already now through the world &apos;s atmosphere , much more uranium in the world than it is used in all nuclear plants .
in the last 20 years , the most powerful tons of uranium has been distributed to our fields in germany .
and we take it all up .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , the environment , go down less cars .
the environment , make less waste .
the environment , the environment , is less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
this is like when i say , you know , the child , you get it three times five times five times .
this is just a little less destruction .
if we think about the norwegian to the most prolific , our whole earth used to be , or later , a cemetery .
that &apos;s why the norwegian to think about the mutilated .
and the most important thing about this is to look at the ground as first .
in the ground , over 60 percent of the world &apos;s population is stored .
now , we &apos;re building corn and losing between 11 and 30 kilograms of 30 tons per hectare , or also on the square meter .
that means we &apos;re losing about five thousand times more than new than new .
we can actually look at the most important thing .
and everything is packaging or content .
for example , in the most violent 20 percent of the world &apos;s population , the most prolific of the world &apos;s population is now imposed .
and because we &apos;re getting older , the ambulance will be bigger .
this is all in the way that they &apos;re in the most violent .
yes ?
one baby needs about six thousand milligrams .
we could reduce that for 10 percent , but what does it do ?
this is going to be balanced in china in a second .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go with this feminist ?
and here &apos;s one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is being emitted in the pigs over the very stable components .
in the people over the urine .
yeah .
so , there are men who can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what it is , right ?
traditionally , we think in the world &apos;s business , we &apos;re too many on the world .
and if you &apos;re the people who are when you put it into people , if you say that it &apos;s better , you &apos;re not there , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re going to be a little bit of them .
and so someone like al gore says , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more powerful than the human population to stabilize .
in israel , you say , if you live a life , you &apos;re going to be the earth .
here it says , the more you &apos;re going to be the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh about four more than we humans .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , no one likes termites , in so far , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means the ants weigh much more than we .
and because they &apos;re physically working harder than we and because they live only three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in the energy consumption , something 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you &apos;re looking at how far we &apos;re going to do , what we really wanted to do , and how sad we are , we &apos;re at all on earth , you can see that for example , there &apos;s a program , for instance ,
you can only be more accurate if you don &apos;t exist , right ?
the only chance .
have you seen a tree tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be asleep as a trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is a tree .
luckily , not , yes ?
there &apos;s no more a street on trees .
there are still six billion trees in the northeast of the water .
you &apos;ve heard about it , you know , a little bit of a tree of trees ?
that means all our intelligence means that we want to be waking up as a trees .
and where you see , even in something like a neurologist , the most sensitive biological , agriculture , not that our own food system is going back .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go back into the chain .
and so we &apos;re too many .
alone .
that &apos;s what we feel so guilty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no more a marketing , no more , no more , no , no , no , and how they all are going to go back to our own shells .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , which is oil oil .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , it &apos;s the highest , right ?
so , yes , yes ?
you can only have the only time you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot yourself , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can back our nutrients back .
we &apos;re doing agriculture in brazil where we go back to nutrients .
so , right now , we can put nutrients in agriculture in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china for example , where we take the waste of it .
in china , a more powerful one today is still a more powerful , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid , our nutrients .
that means that the western western media is going to be taken out of the city , but the farmers never have a little given .
and so the cities had to grow more , because the farmers were going to go to cities and they had to keep their nutrients away .
so all the western rich are always expanding , until they don &apos;t have the infrastructure anymore , and then they &apos;re the mining .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done a little bit of the five thousand civilization over five thousand years , because you &apos;ve always been able to bring nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat in china , you &apos;re expected to be the food that you &apos;re going to be able to see the toilet .
because it &apos;s a sneak to go and take nutrients .
you have them to get them to eat , not to the food .
that means you can see the internet , how you can get nutrients back .
it &apos;s actually beautiful , if you do that , so agriculture makes it , it &apos;s a hectare of a country with five thousand people in favelas , and it can be a farmer , and the plant is waiting for a farmer and the pig and the
and the great thing about this is that the most important thing in the favelas around the favelas is over over ninety percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people , so much bad .
we can support them , good to be good .
this is of course , of course , but the plants carry themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by design , which is a farmer that can just operate .
that means that the most important thing is going back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve now built over the last 20 years , not from these facilities , ever have been a lot of the food .
you could easily be able to get a liter of a liter of water and then be ruined for years .
don &apos;t find .
that means we don &apos;t need to control people , so much bad .
we can support them , good to be good .
that means we need to have phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you &apos;re going to write in germany , in germany , the best of all expenses in the car .
unfortunately , not in the most violent , but maybe you can help the most of the time .
because the most important thing could be the phosphorus &apos;s phosphorus .
and that has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s really possible .
we &apos;ve been using the in holland now over three years .
the dutch government has explained , they will be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need that overall .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
there &apos;s a bunch of a bunch of plastic types .
these are the most pervasive countries that control 40 percent of the world &apos;s population .
and the oil will replace us by other energy systems .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace you .
so it &apos;s not about making the existing one less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s especially asking questions about what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
in holland , you understand that easier because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if you &apos;re sad for example , if you &apos;re upset , if you &apos;ve got them upset , and you come to 50 more .
completely inefficient .
but , really , it &apos;s effective , right ?
or take a continuous patch .
a woman in germany eats about six kilograms of three kilograms during her life .
it &apos;s .
this isn &apos;t exactly the exact right thing , because we don &apos;t know how much more powerful is going to be .
but a teapot , even at this lighting , can i tell you , is completely inefficient , but it &apos;s really effective , right ?
it &apos;s a whole thing that &apos;s beautiful in life , not efficient .
that &apos;s not the resource efficiency , but efficiency .
questions about what is the right ?
not to burn the most important thing , and it &apos;s a little bit better to lose and lose it in the world &apos;s materials , but to be able to ask all the materials to do that , but first of all , how do you make the
so , imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i put them up to dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with a little bit of water and a glass of water .
wonderful , &quot; ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything in life is beautiful , not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything in life counts is not to save , to avoid reducing .
all the time .
we say the people , oh , you don &apos;t have green in the south .
no , the throw away is exactly the right thing , right ?
in every place where you &apos;re going to be a , you know , you &apos;re going to get back to the ground .
but the wrong things .
if you &apos;re going to get the wrong things , you have a more powerful .
in how we think of north .
there &apos;s any footprint there .
if you walk , yes , everybody &apos;s damaged the ground .
because the bottom is going to die the mosses and the wind and the water is washing away .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every footprint means that the water is longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that is going to be a poacher .
not a lot of the time .
we say in germany , sustainability .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how do you do this with your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; yes , &quot; yes , yes ?
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so not saving , steal , avoid .
every waste is essential .
and it &apos;s a lust when you see in italy , like the people in the high bow , and they &apos;re going to kick out of the car .
because you know , this is a kind of a design process .
it &apos;s a form of the form of design , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
we have developed a design system , for example , which is in room temperature , which is a liquid .
you can throw them out where they go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re building all over the place .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they &apos;re going to contribute through the diversity of biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so it &apos;s two cycles .
not all of you should be a shoe .
a television or a washing machine , which is just using them , they don &apos;t use them .
just the things that the most powerful , like the design of how , like , like , like , have a lot of the time , that you have to go to biological systems .
the things that are used only to go into technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the design of the day , yes ?
so direct ads , and not for the company of puma , but that they &apos;re now helping this company to make these products successfully .
because we don &apos;t do things more freely .
yes ?
so , if i go to the food and say , that &apos;s free from the food , then you don &apos;t help it .
no , we &apos;re stuck in what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like the sound of the brain .
not toxic in it .
it &apos;s all in that , it &apos;s useful .
these are the first shoes that you can take on the top of the mountain , and the rubber in biological settings can go , yes ?
everything is a shoe of it .
and if it &apos;s possible , of course , we can do it for rehabilitation , for nike , for the food industry and the whole industry industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the world &apos;s most popular world that causes the textile industry .
so , you help , ask yourself , ask people to ask .
hey , puma , do you really make it seriously ?
because they &apos;ve been changing twice the most successful .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really do it .
so , help me do a little bit about it .
but it &apos;s going .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been shown .
this is what it goes .
we can do things so that they &apos;re going to break out when they break , if they break , they can be in biological settings .
technical loops are just as much .
there &apos;s a direct thing for this .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , that &apos;s made for that in the circulation .
so , in every store , you can do things like this .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the bloodshed of the story ?
if it &apos;s the waste right now .
all over the place , these dictatorships are around , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there &apos;s a lot of time on the street , but also in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastics , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the world &apos;s energy , that they can just go back to the ground , then they can plant with a baby in israel or tunisia .
yes ?
and if you take these baskets , they &apos;re picking up , and they &apos;re taking the powder , and they take the powder to plant trees .
so this is the baby &apos;s baby , for the whole life , from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be more inclusive , we can be more inclusive .
it &apos;s kind of a design print of print .
yeah , so .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can even reinvent everything .
i started a institute .
now , there are many people working there with all of them , and they can all be engaged .
there &apos;s extra one of the things that you can do , where everybody can join .
so no longer save , stealing , avoid , reduce , not a more powerful , but smart waste .
does it make you curious ?
thank you .
the work of the design .
music as language .
in the description of my talk , i wrote that i was as a computer designer , as a as a as a as a as a , in english , understanding .
and the word is the written notes of the written notes in a little bit of music .
that you don &apos;t just have to get a word for word , the text in a different language , but also the deeper sense of words and the other sense of words , so that it has to make a useful translation , everybody knows that it has
now , from the german to the english , you can need more knowledge , it &apos;s more , especially if you &apos;re going to go to poetry or poetry .
but it &apos;s very alien to the terms of terms of what we do with our own bodies .
as a result of a computer , i first had the written notes .
you think that the composer in the notes has all the same things that he had imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and advertisers .
these notes are about the same or the resemblance , as a verbal verbal , as well as a verbal , description of a landscape .
because in this verbal desire , the smell of flowers is not to smell the flowers , the degree of the brain &apos;s rights , not to hear the most of the brain &apos;s disease , not to feel .
this means the interpreter has to be the key of the world &apos;s brain , which is a different , which is a different , concrete , non-verbal , non-verbal , non-verbal .
today i want to tell you what i &apos;m doing , so i &apos;m going to translate to a verbal language , so again , in a verbal language .
so basically , a translation of translation .
so i &apos;m going to pull it up to the german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be equivalent to me with translation of translation .
so the music is working for me as much as the spoken language .
the main notes have the function of the letters of a script .
so it &apos;s not going to be just reading grades and to get the keys to the piano or the right place on a computer table .
because that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the point of the letters is you can only see when you can do the language .
so , you need to be able to use the music process at least as long as the spoken language .
there &apos;s also a fragmented , whether you &apos;re learning it for the most profitable , just passive or you can also talk to the musical speaker , until the musical speaker .
the work of the design is starting to be similar to how one of the most powerful .
after first , a piece of play has chosen to play because you &apos;re excited about the emergence of the composition of the composition of the composition .
you collect information about the piece in the field of information .
you read in the letters , you read notes , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts of the composers itself .
you studied the works that he was doing before and after .
you think of it .
the motives , to write it .
how did he feel ?
how were his circumstances , how the society and politics ?
all of this is interested in me .
you think in this time , by looking at contemporary images , or reading literature .
but with time , you also have a magic of knowledge , and the composers you &apos;re doing , you know , the composers you play more and easier to feel in it , and feel easier to feel in it .
the composer is always going to be more to the friend of the world that you live with .
his cause to write the piece is always becoming more and more and more to my personal concerns , it &apos;s playing .
now , there &apos;s a little bit of the notes that the subject of the composer is , but just a framework , i turn this framework , and i &apos;m now going to turn this framework to make sense and meaning to it .
i then say with my own words , which could be written between this framework .
i play the game of what these sounds might have to mean .
now for me , and for the composers , and what they might mean now for him today .
every note , every phrase , gets a sense of a sense because i feel it , because it comes from my personal personal .
it has to be in here and now , in the case , i can &apos;t convince my audience that my cause is that my cause is .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , and i have a very happy concert when i can have the experience that i &apos;ve been able to have a long time to see how new to experience .
as you &apos;ve been seeing a happy new day , even though it &apos;s always related to the same rituals of life , up , breakfast , to work , so i &apos;ve always got the same piece of time to the new .
i &apos;ve become a day older , the seasons switch down , my pulse goes down at night as the morning , in a auditorium , it takes longer that sound back back to home .
i &apos;m going to breathe the audience , consciously , or unconscious .
all of this affects me and all of this affects my experience with the composition .
so , it &apos;s also wonderful when i stand on a stage on the stage and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , more energetic conversation .
you get a new idea in and in spite of this answer , that answers with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting because things that we haven &apos;t practiced , and what you can &apos;t have been able to do is not yet .
it makes great fun to make music , and you have the audience , then , as the music communicates alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play more like this in this moment .
i can &apos;t play this way in 20 years .
there &apos;s more life life than today , and i &apos;m going to have a lot more of the time of the web of the world &apos;s time , and that &apos;s why i have a lot more of the time of emotions and emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some more sophisticated things , but for new money .
have a nice example of this .
it was on a computer factory for a fellow for my beloved old teacher , professor , a famous , famous , famous , a famous , long-term , and long-term professor of the world &apos;s book here in the wild .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so he was already a lot of time when i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortune , and i was very early , with 13 years , and i was going to meet my school classes on his school classes .
i was 17 when i went back to one of his courses , and i played the last one of the four calls of chopin , a computer company .
he asked me what the introduction of this kind of puzzle was for me .
this is a piece of a piece of water .
and in my favorite , i said , expectation .
and he &apos;s like , &quot; he , &quot; and he said , &quot; so ?
that &apos;s the idea of the food .
because for me , she means memory .
he was already over 60 .
well , with 17 , you have a dream , but no major memories .
i play the piece of all the few years and i &apos;ve got it all over the time , and it &apos;s been changed for me , although not a single note has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , i &apos;m going to read something new .
an example of a whole different area . so , the most important thing is , the most powerful thing is made .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different cases of time , in the light of light .
he &apos;s translated the most sophisticated water , as he saw it , as it looked at it in this moment .
his personal personal security system .
the most common interpretation of a piece is comparable .
now , i &apos;m also older than chopin , when he wrote the piece .
he &apos;s lived only for years .
and it &apos;s important to look at the notes , even though i mean , you can memorize it .
to keep the book , right with the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially if he died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said , you know , you need about the same as the spoken language .
often the most important thing is that you &apos;re learning the notes .
you &apos;re basically learning to read the first one before you just talk a word .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument on the instrument .
and when all the fingers in time and right like it is in the notes , they come out of sound , then sound sounds like music .
if that &apos;s accurate , the students get the most prolific piece .
it &apos;s not going to be talked about interpretation of the field .
well , there &apos;s a very quick thing on the front of it , which is a quick piece .
so , slow , slow .
according to the , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s what most of you know here .
but even if you translate this data , it &apos;s still a technical thing .
and it &apos;s still not an interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something very much about it .
because , to make music on the instrument , that &apos;s your musical musical and feel that you should be there before .
that &apos;s what the singing is .
a child who didn &apos;t learn that , because it doesn &apos;t have the parents to do it , it &apos;s not going to do it by itself .
this is like the most cosmopolitan .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music to have a more possibility , so about a tool , to make it sound .
people who never sing , so they never felt immediately with their own body , like it &apos;s , to form a tone .
a phrase to make his own breath .
because the music system is the extension of our body .
our vocal vocal team to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the piano is the sequel of my finger .
the tune comes from the surface of the dance and the rhythm of the dance .
the continual food system today is not really useful .
you don &apos;t need to make music more if it &apos;s going to be boring .
no longer needed to whistle a car whistle or singing .
every single music is going to be bent when you &apos;re going to be able to get out of the outside with music .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t sing ?
the question i can &apos;t sing , can you sing , a , because you can &apos;t sing that you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they don &apos;t have learned to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to start to figure out whether they can &apos;t , or learn how to do these little muscles that are using the vocal vocal vocal vocal , right .
because you can train it .
or c , because you have it , you &apos;re going to be able to be a little bit of it .
so , i wonder how much of the collective competent was this diagnosis ?
have you been able to have a more powerful or a more powerful , like you &apos;re going to say it today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and you don &apos;t want to do anything with it .
but what i &apos;d like to do is , because music is a beautiful , more powerful thing .
but maybe you can also even be more inclusive .
well , you see , all the cases , nobody has to be a candidate candidate .
but don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand anything from classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i mean , i &apos;m sure you can say , you know , you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says somebody , i don &apos;t know if i can &apos;t cook , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t get rid of food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to get rid of classical music , because you don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to it , and say , if it tastes to you or not .
whether the music is to be too sweet or too sweet .
tell that what you feel .
and you can also get some more spices and you want to get some more spices there , or taste even fine differences .
why am i asking now from my audience that it &apos;s also active ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate there .
a piece of artwork that you never look at is not a force .
the food that was used by a chef or a chef was being eaten , and not just looked at or just looking at recipes .
so please listen to a music , if you &apos;re playing a music .
it &apos;s not just a nice thing .
if in a environment where the adults are actively looking at music or at least , music is growing , a child , then it &apos;s very easy to ask , to ask , what color has your flower ?
can you also play them in blue ?
and the child is playing , after a computer , rather than a red flower , and a blue flower .
and this sounds very different than before .
and that was the first beginning of a musical expression .
so the first step to a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece of today , which was originally written a hundred , two hundred or two years ago , before three hundred years ago ?
now , the instruments have moved .
there was no piano at the time , as a tool , as a tool .
it was not yet invented .
i think the stream would have been excited if he had the verbal opportunity of the modern world &apos;s own life .
i can now have the most sophisticated , which has been the stream , on the modern wing to sound , which is not a viable ball of energy .
and by beethoven , you know that he heard more than he had been deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that has been rejected by the orchestra as a result of the time .
so the composers are dependent on us , which is the pieces of the pieces again .
so they &apos;re going to be bent , which they &apos;ve just imagined in the spirit .
and also , what you would think about today in the spirit .
or what i &apos;m doing today is because what you might have thought about .
thank you .
you know what envy is ?
were they once sandals ?
and how did that feel ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a laser .
when i come to my little v , i &apos;m going to go back to my little v , and i &apos;m going to get this feeling .
i &apos;m going to take something through the head .
i say , &quot; what do you need to do , &quot; the n big car ?
and that &apos;s the first year that half of his value is .
and at all , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to afford to do that so &quot; n little car ? &quot;
and then i immediately fall , that &apos;s unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this awkward feeling is gone .
our organism has invented a great way to get such a uncomfortable emotion like envy .
you can also try that with words like revenge or a little bit of a time or a certain way .
i want to explain to you today with this mechanism or something that &apos;s probably familiar with you .
the mechanism comes from lying .
but think about the lie , as you may have heard , if people say , nobody has the intention to build a wall .
and then rocks , so he &apos;s going to cut them off the way .
in a lie like this , you see that the liars don &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to check out that it &apos;s very different in the sense of it .
he &apos;s just making it , and not himself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , that has to do with it , that they &apos;re fooled .
they need this lie to get a more powerful , to get a self-deception .
you can make less easy , yes , and you can get it down , or you can get it down .
they need time .
and this time , a anecdote is talking about that you might know .
the spanish painter picasso once has a woman .
and this woman has been complaining about it , the portrait would not look like her .
picasso says , wait just .
it &apos;s always going to be more similar .
and at this point , when you laugh , you see how important this lie is and how much time you need to learn something to be what artists can tell us .
because artists have a high relationship to lie .
the artist tells you something , and especially this lady , what you don &apos;t see when you just look at the mirror .
the artist tells you something like this a portrait of something that you &apos;re going to be familiar with when you &apos;re going to look at this piece of artwork .
then this awkward feeling , it may not be like you , and it &apos;s always going to be more similar to you .
here you have this mechanism that we can use as a great invention to the heart of our own health system .
and not only in art , in the most fundamental , in the mythology , in the mythology , it comes back .
you may know this idea of the lady , who looked at every morning in the mirror and asked him who is the most beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a little bit of a time .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this true appeal , the mirror can &apos;t lie , from that true appeal .
but we should just be familiar with that that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a little bit different in a different way .
here it is necessary , which we &apos;re understanding under the most powerful , again , again .
we need this lie that we have to keep the deception that we can &apos;t survive without yet .
we don &apos;t just have the art in the art of the world , but in science , it &apos;s such great lies .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s history of the u.s.
she heard about this book from charles darwin , the origin of the species and the full line of people .
that the man of the monkey should and , yes , there would be a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then they ran them to her husband and said , &quot; well , that &apos;s not true , what charles da writes .
the human being is supposed to have a common ancestor or a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to prevent that people are going to know about it .
why do we need to prevent people from something that is true ?
because we can &apos;t live without these things .
because we , this self-deception , that sense , to be great , the highest creatures of the highest creatures , not from such a kind of a kind of a kind of organism , like a organism that exists , and the things that are still in the
so , we can &apos;t do these things .
we need to prevent people to know things about things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you see how slowly this mechanism is coming out and how the traces look like that he &apos;s leaving , which is going to lead to something else than this great picture of ourselves , i want to give you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , like i mean .
my wife told me it .
she came from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told her about a student .
a student student .
you like it particularly , because he &apos;s got a slope to the sincerity .
and she asked him what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire fire .
and because i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in the things i &apos;m interested in .
yes , you feel it when you &apos;re fed up on this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i said , i &apos;ve always said , if a human being in a moral twist , the most important thing is , because we should try and replace it by replacing it through the brain .
and you &apos;ll do that once and then you experience the sentence .
although i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in the things i &apos;m interested in .
they feel that this is the actual truth behind the outbreak .
so a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a sudden , that &apos;s not interested in the design of the world .
the interest is the interest .
but there &apos;s no clubs that we can look around , where you learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second second , the fire fire .
he was signed up .
and the reason you &apos;re not saying it is , you know , your teacher doesn &apos;t like you to put fires somewhere and be happy if the fire after the fire came out .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of the dangers that the other people can do when they put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
these are the most profound things that we &apos;ve seen in the heart of the world &apos;s brain that he actually has been related to the fire , but that he can &apos;t say it loud .
here you have this kind of thing between the unconscious and the conscious , which immediately jumps up , without that you can do something about it , and the things that you know is very different , and you can make it sound better for you and others
so , just as simple as these words we &apos;re using in the language of the politically correct clinical trials .
we actually know that something else is the case .
but we know if we call that , the social narrative is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to do things like this in a society that &apos;s going to work .
now i want to tell you what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
after which logic , this delusion , the willingness , the willingness to be a different reality than the ones we actually know in the unconscious knowledge is that they &apos;re valid to spread outside .
so i want to show you two , maybe three examples of this .
the first example is , what many of you know and some of you appreciate , very few of you don &apos;t need to do anything .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is so much intellectual , say about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not about stop , natural nature .
and if you have people who are the most powerful belief that they have a soul , or you can also say that they &apos;ve been brought out of the soul to live , then they &apos;re like the soul that they have , they &apos;re just like the
and from that soul , you think that somehow you kind of in this cloudy nature , in this particular kind of nature , it &apos;s called the latin , the most powerful , present , present .
and when this particular one is then , then , the people who are going to be able to do it , it &apos;s filled with dignity , with spirit , with nature , that can only live with the soul .
and then he can just be a little bit of a time .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so you want to go from the outside to the people .
so we should be able to perceive what &apos;s going to be present for our lives .
and if you have this premise of eyes , you understand the logic that we &apos;re experiencing , with a lie , to improve our world .
because now you can apply a laser test .
you know , you know , it &apos;s a school .
this is a very , a video system that describes us a logic .
this is the hardest part of the hardest part in my talk .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
so to lie that they can just apply this logic to the very wrong .
in this case , three sentences come from .
the first sentence is , &quot; there &apos;s no soul . &quot;
so the second sentence is , if you have a right , it &apos;s not a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i was particularly drawn to him here .
a third sentence , which immediately shows people who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul , that &apos;s dead and can &apos;t claim anything .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s the logic in this , yes , in this particular talk , to expression .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , these are logical .
i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any speech about reality .
i can say , the most powerful is a man .
and if i have right , the most powerful one is a man .
if i don &apos;t have right , the most powerful man is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a statement about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but the key is , if i have right , it &apos;s true .
so if you say , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical .
and now our consciousness is immediately feeling , and it can make something .
it &apos;s a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s what it does as if the first sentence is already proven and more vulnerable .
because actually , we have to prove whether there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that just uses that two sentences are accurate , and a third of the world &apos;s favorite , which looks like he would have something to do with it , so we can save our food systems .
so , we &apos;re doing it as if it &apos;s actually impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue to continue these things in different examples .
in the present , we have a very modern example of the world that &apos;s always filling up the oil .
and you have to think about another philosophical topic , a more philosophical thing , present from philosophy .
so that &apos;s what we do to do that in the world &apos;s brain .
there was a scholars who was called johannes , and after that , the most prolific 11-year-old named .
the most prolific psycho is a holistic , which is made of pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
this is a kind of a design system .
and if you place the exact exact exact same in the middle between two , it &apos;s going to be a lot of time .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a haystack he should do first .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
so the most popular thing is the first place .
and the power of the forces with the other people &apos;s power is solving each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
just if you get another example , so if you make a haystack bigger , it doesn &apos;t need any reason and nothing to do it .
automatically , he &apos;s going to be the right idea .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re somehow driven in nature , you will be able to get away from the larger pile that you put on a instantly , you have the feeling that it has to give you a free will .
and if we &apos;re in the field of the world , i remember the brain game for brain science .
there &apos;s a scholars that says wolf , and it &apos;s sometimes saying , wolf , wolf , there &apos;s no free free .
now we can make the second sentence , and we can say , if wolf has right , it &apos;s not free .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can do almost a daily day in the daily newspaper , find them in this third sentence .
it looks like this , who doesn &apos;t have any free free , can &apos;t be pulled for his actions and claims to responsibility and it &apos;s so versatile .
and here you have it again .
and actually , you have to prove to you , if there &apos;s something like free .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this as if the first sentence of the first set of birth is wrong than you would have to take the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just do something if you want to do anything , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , that courage to lie to lie .
so , for example , if you &apos;re going to meet a human being , you can tell you , there &apos;s no more food .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for the ted word , which means prophet .
you can &apos;t call that , that would be a little bit more politically political .
say , there &apos;s no more sophisticated .
immediately you will be one , for granted , for granted , that you can &apos;t prove .
and you have a problem .
because while they &apos;re busy , they &apos;re not able to prove that they can &apos;t prove that there is no way to be a man &apos;s disease .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s fooled .
because he &apos;s led to a red , he &apos;s not going to be on the top of himself .
because actually , this man is not interested in evidence .
it &apos;s just interested in the need to be able to prove to yourself that there &apos;s a lot of evidence to prove that there are a lot of time .
so , in the way the evidence of the evidence is the brilliance of the lie .
and once you have a way to feel this , this kind of thing that &apos;s going to be in other people , do it , because they &apos;re going to make other happy if they don &apos;t remember them in their own way .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve been allowed to have a question of myself , if i can mention it .
she &apos;s one of the most amazing things here , and she asked me if i wanted to give a talk here and my idea of the idea .
i have to say , you know , you &apos;ve got it , it &apos;s hard to talk to me about my idea .
and i may think maybe my favorite thing is that i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
but it &apos;s the sum of the whole , many ideas .
i &apos;m probably , you know , the two nice girls still , i probably become the generation that &apos;s made for this bad image image , because i &apos;ve been starting to study engineering in the field of engineering , technical college , today , i think ,
and i went to berlin , and i was going to go to berlin , because i wanted to make renewable energy and i didn &apos;t have it in the street .
there was the most popular thing .
the ones that were all the time , the most popular , was called the most powerful .
the hot today is called the &quot;
because a good engineer has either built a great car or a good engineer .
but this is what the n of the n , which is a hundred watts from the square meter , which was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy nut nut .
i &apos;m grateful to the fact that he &apos;s got the word again , because after the time , you had to use the word , because it was all the left , because everything left left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that much in the u.s.
there was this thing that was the case of the fact that there was a lot of time in the middle of the street , where you thought that evil was in the middle of the world .
and the place of the computer , but that was called the wind , and it was made wind and solar power and i started the middle of the 1980s .
and yes , a lot of what was said today , i &apos;m very , very , very , very beautiful , many beautiful expressions that i &apos;ve lived in .
i worked in the collective , and i &apos;ve been working in the collective .
we were 20 people .
if one didn &apos;t say that , the most important thing was , the most powerful thing , i &apos;ve been doing a very hard thing for 10 years , i &apos;ve been very hard to do it for a little bit of my father &apos;s day , because
it &apos;s busy with insanity .
and that was really , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , a picture of a stick where i asked myself to have a
and i then have to go to the street and then we have a little bit of the way to get friends to the company , which then became the most powerful of the world &apos;s most powerful , and then the most powerful of the world &apos;s largest
a more powerful , but also , of course , we have the problem of a growing company and we have a little bit of a group , and we decided that we &apos;re going to start little and go back and go back and think of the next
and i brought you a project that i want to introduce you to now .
and the title of the talk was , yes , how to get to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started asking a relatively , very much a story of a relatively crude story where you could use a memory today .
on this island , this is the island of the island of the island .
yes , these are the data .
there are four thousand people living there .
now , they have an renewables today from 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
it &apos;s just technological .
if you wind up more wind , the system starts to fail .
i also tell the politicians , if they &apos;re in the same way , when they &apos;re in the field of food .
and then they always say , why ?
we &apos;ve already got 20 percent in germany .
but can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have seven percent , and our network is physically seen the european .
if we had in europe 20 percent , we &apos;ve had the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , and it was a very , very , very popular , and the first contacts started with the island , but just just calculate .
as big as it would have to be , it &apos;s a battery that you have to do so that you have a island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and yes , i &apos;ll go back to a slide .
the conventional system looks like this in the world .
by the way , a year of a hundred gigawatts , the way about a hundred gigawatts , will be downloaded on the world .
that &apos;s the performance of a hundred nuclear power power , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the world &apos;s favorite world , the world &apos;s going to be deleted with abalone , because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s fast .
you &apos;re so much like this box .
and then it looks like this .
in the run of three , three of the people are going to wait .
yeah , so this is what it looks like down there .
we also have very precise data .
and the most popular or the solar system or whatever it is , is a system of a system , or a system , which can only be in small quantities here .
our goal was to say , okay .
the typewriter is going to be the wind and the wind , the sun , the burden that you can map the larger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , energy per year , not the performance in the moment , then you have to turn off the typewriter .
that means that the moment you have to worry about that is that renewables can take the entire net .
and of course , you can only get managed to get managed in some kind of way .
that &apos;s what nobody did on the world .
so , that &apos;s in the small style , so you can also use your car &apos;s car on a little bit of a little bit of a car .
people always ask me what they &apos;re doing in the field of life ?
that &apos;s what it &apos;s going on .
but if you want to get multiple of these online types of water , and you want to build a net , it will be extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to come to 70 percent renewable and then there &apos;s still this rest that last 10 , 20 percent renewable , renewable , renewable , renewable , which will be very , very expensive , and that &apos;s not going to work
it &apos;s going to be a fuel system that then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , or sh , that will be .
you have to go to a more sophisticated and not just balance and not just balance .
we just wanted to know what is a normal , scalable battery , and we wanted to go to the battery .
how far is you going to get there ?
and then , you know , a whole lot of simulation did .
and have wind and sun and the burden of the sun and came to the conclusion , a very exciting outcome that you need to go to the conventional system , which takes 20 cents a middle of about 50 cents a gallon , about 50 cents a gallon
these were the first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
and it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the most powerful , when the average age is rising five percent per year .
and then we started to negotiate with the most sophisticated .
what would everything have to be done ?
have investors negotiate , i &apos;ve been looking for new school projects .
we were only five people at the time to build a society again .
and here &apos;s the representation .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system also has a more powerful , because we &apos;re still doing 20 percent of the oil , and also a more powerful thing to do with the other things .
and the most popular , the most popular that the most popular thing is , is that we find it very well .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , which we can sort of map the electrical narrative of the island in the scale of the island .
so , we &apos;ve been looking for the first battery to find the largest battery in the world .
here she is .
it &apos;s naturally coming from asia , in the case of japan .
and it &apos;s a second of the bbc in the &apos; 70s , and the bbc &apos;s day , and then it was developed , and then it became the japanese .
it &apos;s you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
she has a megawatts of performance and can take six hours for six hours and that &apos;s the battery that we have sort of a little bit of time .
and then they set up .
we also have one of these most powerful things in the same size , as he &apos;s standing there in the hall to actually do the complete dynamic behavior of this web , so in the hall , it &apos;s now the great battery , here &apos;s the whole
over here we simulate the whole thing that &apos;s the whole thing that &apos;s the cable , the cable of the cable , to sort of represent the most important thing in the net .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we can also put two kilowatts of whiskey on the web .
here we see this again again , again , again , the ozone , and again , the whole one , single , single type of energy .
and what we did since the last time was the hall , then , until today , the hall was done , and it &apos;s basically all the things that are here between the individual system of electronics , we did .
so we &apos;re not a more pessimistic , but we define ourselves as a company that is only between the subject of battery and the subject of the web .
you have to communicate , of course , to communicate , you have to communicate in the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is that you &apos;re basically in this island , which is basically the most important thing that we &apos;re going to get to problems that we &apos;re going to get when we want to increase our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion , as it &apos;s going to go back and forth , and the way that you want to go , we have to have the island of the island , for example , for example , for example , to 30 percent of the wind
and then , you know , it &apos;s going to be a lot of time .
so , a computer company , a water game everywhere .
we can start to integrate on the island , to integrate , to integrate , to integrate , because you can manage the burden .
that means if you &apos;re at 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can go through &quot; n &quot; , you can go through the nets , yes , you should do it in any case , the percentage of the , but you never can get rid of memory .
and that &apos;s the &quot; n little bit . &quot;
so , many people and look at this , and they &apos;re looking at this , because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn off the ozone , you don &apos;t have that spinning mass , which causes a certain inertia in the net .
and our favorite system is basically just rotating mass of large power , where the wave is all around europe , where the wave is all around europe .
we look at this web , and we see 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s a point of nine hertz , we start a few more cosmopolitan , then we &apos;ll start a little bit of steam , then we &apos;ll get a little bit of steam ,
this is the system .
and of course , this is incredibly high .
if you &apos;re going to go somewhere , it &apos;s a little bit of time .
the most important reserve has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in time , they can respond to other people .
if you don &apos;t have that , this spinning mass , you have to replace it with the kind of light and the metal .
and we can once have two milliseconds of this big battery .
and then you see what enormous amounts of energy there are .
and the message is , we need to get rid of these rotating masses when we kind of have our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 percent and so on , if we want to reach the ones at all .
then we have to break our capacity into the net .
so , the power station is simply going to go through the power station to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a very , very clear moment , the moment of the ted , because we don &apos;t , or we don &apos;t know , or it &apos;s not going to be .
and we &apos;re just trying to make it work that you can get the capacity to break the capacity , and it can break down the grid , by the way , to get a distraction of memory .
so , fortunately , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies now .
and then , to this purpose , people always come and look at our own , sort of , our main system .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far can you get a piece of future there .
and many discussions that i had in the last six years , were similar to the discussion i had in the last 30 years to the subject of whiskey .
not , is insanity , and we have all of the things we &apos;ve done , and we never do .
we have 30 gigawatts today in germany .
this is a little bit of a time .
and i just go from that , in the next 30 years , that we &apos;re going to store the same capacity to cement on the world .
just just , it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s a lot of the data of the brain , and arguments .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve been in the last two years , that scientists are going to be on my side .
we &apos;ve got over 10 million of the world &apos;s worth of time , and we have to get to the german web now .
this is going to happen in april april .
so , from that , you also realize that there &apos;s a change there , and only from that kind of 30-year way to the idea , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable is true .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a solar system .
so far , in discussions , they &apos;re always trying to do this , that they &apos;re doing , they &apos;re going to have a little bit of a web that has a little bit of a web that has nothing to do with our own .
the question is , if you &apos;re completely doing it , if you &apos;re completely independent from some fossil or a half of the world &apos;s worth of fossil or a little bit of the world , you &apos;re going to be a island .
then they just use what &apos;s going on in the sun and wind there where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a nuclear supply supply and i &apos;m grateful to be grateful that they used to use solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and that &apos;s where we come from , also the talk of the ted system , that you can be a collective and use solar energy , a little bit together .
and yes , i just want to encourage you to just encourage you to be a little bit crazy , and you can have a vision .
and you really have to stay quite tough , but i think it &apos;s going to be .
thank you .
when steve lopez , a little bit of time , the los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , a progressive , rough , homeless , who played on a violin , which had only two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from the article of the article , it was a book that was called the back of the book , which was a book that was called the robert lopez , and jamie lopez , and jamie anthony , who
nathaniel left psychiatrists , suffered a breakdown and 30 years later , he lived as homeless on the streets of the los angeles row in los angeles .
i recommend reading all of the book , and i &apos;m proposing the film , so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that came between these two men , but also how the music was able to get this connection , and how it was the instrument
i met mr. &apos;s most in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney hall .
he just heard a demo of beethoven first and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine .
he spoke in a very troubled and a very troubled note about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and the way the dodgers never would create it in baseball series , and that &apos;s all because of the dodgers &apos;s passage of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
we came to talk to music . and a few days later , i got an email in which nathaniel was interested in me .
i have to mention that nathaniel was a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electric and with a lot of the time and it was treated with a trauma that has been tracking him all his life .
as a result , he &apos;s particularly vulnerable to this schizophrenic stages , and these are sometimes so bad , and he disappears for days , in the streets of the row row , always that horror and the most responsible of his own mind .
and in exactly a sense of a summer , nathaniel , when we started with our first class in the walt disney hall , he had this crazy kind of crazy thing in his eyes and worked completely lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and how he wanted to poison someone in sleep .
i was afraid not to be able to be able to lose it , but i was afraid that he could sink to one of his states , and that i could destroy him his relationship to the violin , if i started talking about scale and the other
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s .
and while i was playing , i fell in the eyes of a complete change .
it was as if he was under the impact of an invisible drug , a chemical response , which was a catalyst .
and the other thing that &apos;s turned out is to be turned into understanding , in a calm curiosity and grace .
and as through a miracle he took his violin and started playing a few clips of the computer , and then asked me to play her , and then i would say , &quot; i &apos;m going to play , &quot; -- i &apos;m going to play , &quot;
we started talking about music , starting from bach , and it was , from beethoven , and all the other people , from the other , to the other hand , from the street to the street .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t only know a little bit about music , but it also connected to her very close personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i know about my colleagues in the moma of los angeles .
by playing music and talked about music , it was confused by this kind of thing , confused man , who was just through the streets of los angeles , a computer , a great , great , great , in juilliard .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means emotional health .
because the music allows him to , his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in something real .
and so he &apos;s going to be the gallup condition .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
this is the reason why we make music : so we do something that is in all of us deep inside , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity , to reality .
and the reality of this expression is all of us , and we &apos;re moving , inspired and united states .
what nathaniel set up , so he brought back the music to a community of friends .
the power of music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood him , who recognized his talent and the communication of it .
and i &apos;m going to keep with nathaniel music , whether in the walt disney hall , or in the row row , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno &apos;s : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i stole the most of the time i &apos;m stolen .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first , that was more like a passionate kind of a passionate .
it was a beautiful fish , a good consistency , good consistency , a book on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was being raised in the most precious standards of sustainability .
so you could feel that you could sell it .
i had a relationship with this beauty of several months .
one day , the ceo of the company called , and asked if i could be in a chair about sustainability &apos;s farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem has become for our chefs , how do we keep fish on our menus ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been collecting the oceans as we beat forests bare .
it &apos;s hard to be the destruction of the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish , which we love , the tuna , the most powerful , the most cosmopolitan , they &apos;re collapsed , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , maybe or bad , it &apos;s going to be a part of our future .
many arguments about it . the environment , most of you , the environment , most of you , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a nuclear prize of 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of water is necessary to get a pound of a pound .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so here was finally a company that was trying to do it right .
i wanted to help them .
the day before the event , i called the boss of the pr for the company .
let &apos;s call it don &apos;t .
&quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for that , so far out in the sea , that you don &apos;t get rid of the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out of the way that waste is distributed from our fish , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this is the one of the most remote things that we did .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
the one thing to do is , great .
&quot; marry one thing ? what feeds your ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
and at this evening , i was in bed and thought , what hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , shortly before the event , don &apos;t go .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he will be an opinion .
now , i &apos;m going to do a couple of people in the company , and nobody could give me a proper answer to the senior biologist , until finally , with the senior biologists .
let &apos;s call it don &apos;t call it .
&quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some of the things , and then he said , &quot; he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go .
i said , &quot; do you know ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , skin , dirt , dry and dry . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your body &apos;s body is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , these are about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t , what &apos;s sustainable about eating chicken ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i &apos;m going to get off this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a computer scientist and i &apos;m a plastic maker .
that &apos;s me .
no , i actually have a little bit of a fish , because , i swear to god , the fish , the fish after this conversation , after chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s another kind of love .
it &apos;s romantic art , the way you know the better you learn your fish , you love the fish .
i first ate him in a restaurant in a restaurant .
a little journalist had spoken for a long time since a long time .
it &apos;s kind of a sense of time .
he came up with a bright , almost white white color .
the chef had him .
wait twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish so well after it became a fish ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call him an unprotected . actually , he &apos;s called an unprotected .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish and he &apos;s not a chef , at least on the way that you and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at the la la la .
this is a very reactive corner in the corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s was the farm in the hands of the boat .
they were raised in the way that they were basically the wetlands .
they did that by putting the land out .
they built these complicated episode of channels , and they were pushing out of water from the country and out of the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that that worked , not economically .
and it was a disaster .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds to be a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company bought the land .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of water vice versa .
they literally pushed the lever .
instead of using the water , they used the channels to get the water back .
they &apos;re going to be the canals .
they created a 11,000 acres of water -- the , the shrimp , shrimp , shrimp , shrimp , and the company , and the ecological destruction , completely completely wiped out the ecological destruction .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you &apos;re seeing is the same channels of channels and these density , lush march .
i was not a long time ago with acromegaly .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a part of &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? there we were and fought through the wetlands and i was going to go and put mud and i have mud to my knees , and bud keeps a little bit of a sudden .
and he picks up a rare color .
now he mentioned the most uplifting of phytoplankton .
and here , here he is a pattern of concentrate that reminds him of the most prolific giraffe .
it turns out that miguel has spent the largest part of his career in the national national park in africa .
i asked him how to become a kind of a design of mine .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and falls in more talk of rare birds and algae and weird , weird .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the most amazing community , in the way that you &apos;re in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was love .
and my head was weak about this kind of delicious piece of delicious fish that i had at the most of the time .
so i cut him . i said , &quot; bud , how does it taste that your fish tastes so well ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the powder , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what are your fish eating ?
how is the most important ? &quot;
now , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a wonderful system that the fish eat , which would eat it in the wild .
the ones that are the ones that the dependencies , the zoo , the zoo , is what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely valid .
there &apos;s no food .
the one farm is heard of your animals not feeding ?
later , i went to this site with a dec walk around , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems to be like that , &quot; in a place that seems to be , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
in the moment , when a director would have a computer director .
and we put the bow around the corner and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pinker , a literally pinker carpet that &apos;s going to be so far the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your own , pink . &quot;
they &apos;re going to be . &quot;
so , i was totally confused ?
i said , &quot; bud , you don &apos;t have your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and we &apos;re going to the birds .
now , last year , 600,000 birds were over 250 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s now the largest and one of the most important private private systems in europe .
i said , &quot; bud , is it a good job of a good job , not the last one you want to have on a car factory ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building a lot of the design , not intense .
this is a commercial network .
the shrimp is eating the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the pinker the gut the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals and a farm that measures your success on your health &apos;s health .
a more powerful , but also a more powerful .
oh , and by the way , these are not even the same things that we have before .
they breed in a city of 240 miles , where the most important is better for the food industry .
every morning they fly 240 miles to farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles .
they &apos;re doing that because they can follow the white white line of the highway .
seriously .
i had introduced a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at an unprotected .
i said , &quot; bud , fly 240 miles to the farm and then fly 240 miles back at the night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me when i was quoted just a song of whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like a throwaway . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this kind of thing that &apos;s called the most powerful taste .
i almost never cook with it .
and yet , when i tried to put them in this restaurant in the hospital , they didn &apos;t tasted it for the first time .
she liked sweet and in , as if you would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned the way to be accused and he &apos;s going to be a freaking .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense of the body before something in the body .
it &apos;s evolved throughout evolution to mimic the contaminated . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no more . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish . a farm that measures their success on success .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a farm , he &apos;s a huge , because the water that comes through this farm is coming out of the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things to be , from which rivers tend to be , and they &apos;re going to lead to chemical pollutants , flow of carbon pollutants .
and if it &apos;s fought through the system , and this leaves the water clean , as it is , it &apos;s a clean .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not only one farm , which doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not just a farm that measures their success on their health , but a farm that is literally a more powerful , and not just for those fish , but also for you and me .
because if the water is blowing it up , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because these love love , like romantic , is also also writing .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future good food , whether we &apos;re talking about the future or a drug .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in fact , food really taste .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
we &apos;re not a plastic , we &apos;re a musician . we &apos;re a lover .
we love farmers . we love small amounts of wood . we talk about local food . we eat organic .
and if you say that the things that are good to tell the future is somebody else , and says , &quot; hey , people , i love the most powerful , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;ve already made enough calories to feed the world more than just feeding .
a billion people are starving today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of the most -- because of the most unequal inequalities in the distribution , not the greenhouse gas emissions .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because they have the logic of our favorite , the last 50 years .
feed crops , to the herbivores , of the chemicals on the earth , chicken on fish , chicken , and all the time has simply asked the agribusiness : &quot; if we feed more people , how awful can that be ? &quot;
this was the cause . it was the easy thing . it was the business business of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a craft in the peer-reviewed , a craft that &apos;s fast to be able to do the same environmental capital that allows you to do that .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our main system is threatened today , not because of the most sophisticated , but because of the resources , it &apos;s not due to resources .
not by the latest , and the most prolific , but through fertile land , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not by creationism , but through forests , and not by the fish , and not through the fish , and through fish in the
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that are contributing to each community , to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in it , and it never really has a good thing to eat .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is the one that &apos;s been involved in two billion years of expertise .
look at an automatic , farmers like batman .
businesses that are not worlds for themselves , businesses , rather than the ones that are going to grow , businesses , the most powerful , farmers , who are not just making them , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships
because they are the ones who are experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;m ever going to be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if the future is good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to illustrate one thing today , it &apos;s that the whole data we consume is larger than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking about the most of the parts of the parts , and instead of thinking about it , i think that
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical kind of old view of age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called the &quot; what i can do with a certain death system , &quot; that i can filter for a certain cause of death , we say accidents .
and i immediately see another pattern that makes it happen .
and that &apos;s because in the most active way , people are most active and they &apos;re over here on the top of the day .
we can move out a step further and then we see the data then , and see that the most common suspects and cancer are the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , if we go on and take a step , we say 40 years or younger , we &apos;re going to see that accidents are even the main cause of people who should worry about people .
and who &apos;s looking at the fact that this is particularly true in men .
so you see that the information is very much remembered by information and data in this way that it &apos;s very much in a living form .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not do it for content itself ?
now what we have here is the most individual sport , every single sport that has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it to my talk in your rooms .
with a decade , you can dive into a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this copy and the sports .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i click here , and i &apos;ll just show you all the time that lance armstrong mentioned .
now , if i want to get a snapshot of a second , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the subject of a city ? &quot;
so i go back to a step and i &apos;m going to go back to the perspective .
now i see greg chaplin &apos;s .
and so you get an idea of that , if you hit this kind of information , more specifically , wider , zoom , you don &apos;t just zoom , or not just , you know , not just to browse .
you do something that is actually a little different .
it &apos;s something between and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to do this idea a little bit further with something like a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single one of the most common and it &apos;s reduced to a little summary .
the summary contains a short view and a symbol of the area that comes from it .
i just show the top 500 of the top of the top of the world &apos;s top .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately we get a sense of the issues that are on wikipedia at the top of the world .
i &apos;m going to choose the government &apos; government .
now , after i chose the government , i know that the most important thing that &apos;s going on is the most time that we &apos;re doing the time magazine magazine .
this is really important , because this is a realization that doesn &apos;t have a single single one in a single single car .
that &apos;s just to see if you go back and look at the whole thing .
so , looking at a certain of these summaries , i can go into the subject magazine magazine , and all of them are going to see .
now , if i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of them are the majority of the science . some of them come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize .
so we can jump and look at all the ted prize of the winner .
you see , we &apos;re looking at the net , the first time it &apos;s really a web , not just side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
i just show you the new york times website .
so , the use of this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can see websites that are looking at it -- and we bring these pieces of data to each website like this .
so i can go back to a step , and just to a specific unit of unity .
so this is important because you just look at the websites in this kind of web , and that &apos;s how it can look at all the same kinds of things that are in the same way .
so i can zoom in in my course in a particular place .
here &apos;s the one of the total demonstration i &apos;ve been holding up here .
and i can sort of see anything i &apos;ve seen today , again , again .
and , if i go back to a step and look at everything , i can put my course on my journey , maybe i &apos;ve been looking for my journey , and here , i look for the &quot; aw &quot; here , and here &apos;s the way
and i can go from here to the side and get them back to the side .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used again , and every time it &apos;s going to make the big picture bigger than the sum of the world &apos;s population .
now , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the curse of the world &apos;s car .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going from one to another , we can start to go from many things to many things , and can see patterns that would be otherwise hidden ?
if we can do this , then this past , this is a little bit of a source of information , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge of it .
and if we know , we might even be able to pull out wisdom .
so i &apos;m listening to that , thank you very much .
i grew up with a major portion of science fiction .
i went to school with the bus , every day , a hour .
and my nose always sat in a book , a book of mine , which my thought in other worlds was suspended and in the way my mind was in my deep worlds , fuzzy curiosity .
this curiosity also showed that i was always , when i wasn &apos;t in school , through the forests , and i went to the forests , and they were collecting frogs and snakes and the bugs and the bugs and the potato , and looked at everything under
i was totally troubled , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and the limits of the possible explore .
and my love to science fiction seemed to be in my environment , because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and we were exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came in our living room with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world showed us about miracles that we never could have imagined before .
and that &apos;s what i think is very good at the same time .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there &apos;s neither video games nor video games , and there were a video video that had the whole imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we had to do that at the time , and when we read a book , we took the description of the author , and we put them on the screen in our heads .
my response to this was drawing and paint from aliens , aliens , the worlds , robots , and all of the things .
in math class , i was always caught by the teacher , as i was hidden in the textbook , in the textbook .
creativity had to be kind of out .
and what happened is something interesting . because what i was fascinated with jacques was the idea of a completely unknown world here on our earth itself .
certainly i would never get a alien world with a spaceship , and that seemed quite unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i could actually enter here on earth , and she was equally fascinating and exotic as all i had imagined as i was reading these books .
so i decided to be 15 , diver .
the only problem that i was living in a small village in canada was a $ 10,000 mile from the next ocean .
i didn &apos;t get frustrated with that .
i &apos;m going to see my father , until finally , a computer in buffalo , new york , and i realized , in the other hand , the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my favorite in a pool of the winter in the middle of the winter in the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got two years later to face the face of california .
since then , in the 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about three hours of water , i spent about three hours of water in submersibles .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the ocean , is so rich in the ocean , as rich as we can really &apos;t imagine .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know borders , in contrast to our own , more powerful human imagination .
and for today , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love for the ocean is holding , with the same intensity as ever as ever .
when i was a training , it was a job of the easter .
this seemed the best way to tell my inner urge to tell stories , to create images , to unite .
as a child , i always drew comic books and so .
so movies were the way of bringing pictures and stories together . that fit together .
of course , the stories i &apos;m going to do was , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; the &quot; aliens . &quot;
in &quot; the &quot; abyss &quot; i could connect my preference to the world &apos;s underwater and the diving .
so , basically , my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; s &quot; -- to solve a problem in this movie -- and we had to create a kind of liquid , and we had to create a kind of liquid animation , we picked up , and we &apos;re
what came out of this was the first computer-generated computer-generated , which was ever in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t have a money , and he was just playing his costs , but i realized something fascinating : the audience on the world was like mesmerized from the magic , which went out .
according to arthur clarke , the law is known as the law of technology and magic not to distinguish each other .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s really going to be involved in the most sophisticated . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , much further .
together with a drug set , we created the guy from liquid metal , and the success was completely dependent on how this effect would come .
and it worked . again , we had created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same . but we have a little bit more money with the film .
from these two experiences , a whole new world was reached , a whole new world of creativity for the training of creativity .
so i started a company , with my good friend thom winston , who was at the time of the best ted and the most popular , and she was called &quot; digital art . &quot;
the idea of this company was , the phase of analog processes with visual printers , and start to start with digital printers .
and we did that , and we managed to give a advantage of a time .
but in the mid- &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the middle of the world , and we had the company that we had , and we actually started to get the company to slow up .
i had written this piece , &quot; avatar , &quot; which should be the bar in the kind of visual effects and the effects of the effects in new heights , with comparable human , expressive characters that had been made by using the steel system , and the
but the bar really hit the very beautiful , and people in my company told me that we &apos;re not able to be able to do that .
so i moved this and made this other film about the big ship that goes .
i was selling this as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship , &quot; it became a kind of a memorable epic level , a passionate movie .
but i actually wanted to be in the real train of the titanic .
so i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
but i believe it &apos;s convinced , &quot; we &apos;re going to go to the train . we &apos;re going to film the real train .
we &apos;re going to show it in the movie of the film .
this is hugely important . it &apos;s a good job for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but that &apos;s back to that , that the imagination can create a reality .
we actually created six months later , in which i was in a russian hotel , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i looked at the real titanic through a plastic system .
that was not a movie , no , no , no , that was real .
so , that really blew me up .
and the level of preparation were enormous . we had to build cameras and the lights and all kinds of things .
and i fell on how much these twin , a little bit of a similar way .
well , they were also more competent and more sophisticated planning .
you go up into these capsule , you go down into this dark , hot environment , where no hope is on saving , if you don &apos;t get back to it .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a museum shop .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with studying the deep sea .
anyway , by the part of the thing that &apos;s been curiosity and science , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that i couldn &apos;t give to hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .
in some of the following expeditions , i saw creatures in the field of music , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that had no one ever seen before and for the science of the time when we saw them , no words
so that &apos;s really what i got to do , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
after success , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my favorite my career as a filmmaker in hollywood , and i &apos;m going to be a while for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we started to explore &quot; the &quot; s , &quot; and they were exploring with the computer .
we went back to the titanic of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which was a very high school system .
our intention was to look at the inner and the inside of the ship , which was never before .
no one had the internal exploration of the brain , and you didn &apos;t have any means for it , so we developed the technology .
and so i &apos;m sitting there , on the deck of the titanic , in a museum of a , and see planks that are quite similar to this kind of thing and i know that once the band has played there .
and i fly with a little bit of a little bit of the ship through the ship .
i &apos;m actually breeding it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically in the titanic of the titanic .
this was the most popular form of a design that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i took a corner of a corner , i always knew what was going on in the car &apos;s office , because i was months of film , when we were doing
so the set was a very accurate copy of the developer of the ship .
so that was a highly strange experience .
she made me realize that you use this kind of thing that you use , and so your consciousness in the vehicle can be fixed in the vehicle , and that other forms of existence can be fixed .
it was really immensely profound .
and maybe a little view of what might happen in some decades , if you have a little bit of time to explore or do something else , or to do other things , in all kinds of different forms of energy that i can imagine as a design
after that zone , we started what we saw down there , really appreciate , for example , this kind of thing that we saw , this incredibly amazing animal , which is kind of alien , but here on earth .
they live with help .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight of reference system , like we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
and at the same time , i was also very interested in the most of the time , which was the most popular of my childhood .
and so i ended up with people who are interested in space and to do with nasa and in the world &apos;s rights , and they &apos;re going to be the right thing to do , and they go to russia , and they go through the mission of
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was that i took a lot of time to put on the deep sea .
i took them to the world , and i got access to the world , and i &apos;m going to go down to the world , and i took them to the extreme situations that are interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to the sources
we did a photographic piece , but actually , science , i was doing science , more specifically .
so the circle of my existence was as a child as a child , and the way to do it , and the real estate in reality .
in the course of this voyage , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to have to have a director , also , a leader , like a computer , or something like that .
i don &apos;t understand much of leadership before i have these expeditions .
because in a particular point , i had to say , &quot; what do i actually do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
these stupid films don &apos;t bring us money .
we &apos;re just playing the cost of the cost of the world .
all of you think i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and i would have a little bit of the nails on a towel .
i &apos;ve all got these films , these calculators , for a very small audience .
no glory , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it about the task to be the challenge -- and the ocean is the most powerful environment that you have . you &apos;re doing it for the strange connection , and because of the weird connection , that comes out of a team of people .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who have been working for years , and sometimes we were two to three months on sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the probability of each other , because you have a job to overcome the task that you can &apos;t explain .
if you go back to land , and you say , &quot; we had to do it , the kind of the teapot , the most powerful , and the whole thing that the whole technology , and the trouble , the human performance , if you &apos;re working
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
so when i came back to turn my next film , &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you &apos;re being respected and made in return to respect .
so , the dynamics was really changed .
so i was back with a little team on the unknown terrain , and we did &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that hasn &apos;t been before .
incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we became a very , very , very , a long family for a period of four years .
so , my way of making films completely changed .
there were people who were saying we were really good at this kind of time , and we were actually transported to the planet .
for me , it was more a kind of a design of mine to do my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we do from all of this ?
what lessons are we learning ?
i think the first thing is , the curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the chance of your team is more important than all of the world &apos;s favorite .
i come to my young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice , how i can do something like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t even do a matter of self .
you can get other people . don &apos;t do it yourself , don &apos;t bet yourself , not to take risks . &quot;
nasa has a kind of a design system : &quot; fail is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art and studying , a alternative is going to be an alternative because there &apos;s a sense of a car .
no important endeavor , innovation was always addressed without risk .
you have to be willing to take risks like this .
this is the thought that i &apos;d like to give you on the way . failure is a very alternative , fear , but is not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and perhaps that might be something that &apos;s surprising to my favorite , because my favorite group of the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds to make things that we invent and deliver to the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than any other on the planet .
so , the fact that their crops are not going to grow over many years . it &apos;s too much or too little rain . the things will change as it can &apos;t be able to match their fragile environment .
it leads to the lead . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , a climate change is going to be terrible for you .
and also , the most important thing for you is very important .
the fact is , if you could only reduce the price of the price , energy would be far worse at the most effective .
well , the most popular thing is that it &apos;s time .
in fact , the most important thing is based on the ground .
the industrial revolution , the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in the middle of the world , and so we have refrigerators , air , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s cut the price down -- we &apos;re going to make a new barrier and the barrier with co2 .
co2 is warming the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they add the carbon footprint , which leads to the most powerful and that has a few very negative consequences . effects on the weather and maybe worse , which is the indirect consequence that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to the natural ecosystems and collapse all the
now , the exact exact relationship between a computer and the web system and where their other consequences are , there are some of the people , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i asked the most powerful times , &quot; do we really have to go down to zero ?
isn &apos;t half the one or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue to go up .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a 3.5 foot high truck that has to go under a three feet , and then you can actually put it underneath .
this is a very , very much down , on zero .
now , we &apos;re going to run a lot of a lot of the time , over 26 billion tons .
every americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons of each planet on the planet .
and somehow we have to create changes that lower zero .
it &apos;s been up to it .
only different economic changes have been influenced by the whole , and we need to go from the increase to reducing the rise of a reduction to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit -- co2 -- that you want to get away from zero and that will depend on the number of people , and
so let &apos;s look at each factor of each factor , and we think about how we get this on zero .
probably one of these numbers must come very close to zero .
now this is fundamental algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first of all , we have the population .
today , pisa is now billion people .
and it &apos;s about nine billion of the road points that are going on on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the most powerful and more powerful , we might probably reduce that 10 percent to 15 percent , but we &apos;re going to see a slope to be 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
it &apos;s all that we eat , the food we eat , clothing , heating .
these are very good things , and they &apos;re very good , and they &apos;re almost accessible to each other on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to make some of the things that are going to be , and less use , but in average , this number will increase every year and so on , and so on , the
here we see a very basic service . there &apos;s a light at home , so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their favorite card under the bottom of the world .
now , efficiency , the e , the energy per service , is finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t rise .
because of various successes in the field of life , through other kinds of other ways , through new methods in the world , there are many services that are going to give you a lot of services to reduce 90 percent .
in other service , like making the manufacturing of the world , 105 b.c. : in 1926 , d -- &amp; lt ; d : in 1926 , the world &apos;s worth of improvement , or the most of the time , is a lot of a lot smaller
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may get a reduction to a factor three or maybe a factor of six .
but at the first three factors , we &apos;re now from 26 billion to maybe the hardest 13 billion tons of tons , and that &apos;s not enough !
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to be a unit of energy .
it turns out that you can get that on zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every single time of electricity for electricity today , except renewables and energy production .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need a lot of time .
now , if i use the term &quot; wonders , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and the services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
there &apos;s no deadline , usually , that you need a miracle to a certain date .
usually you &apos;re just wrong and some people come , not .
but in this case , we have to give up a miracle and get a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how can i really get that to get this ?
is there a natural representation , a demonstration that &apos;s going to be the idea of people here ?
i remembered last year when i brought mosquitos and somehow liked the people .
the idea was really tangible for them , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , i fell here .
i decided that the back of fireflies would be my favorite contribution to the environment here .
so here &apos;s a couple of natural fireflies .
you &apos;ve told me that she doesn &apos;t bite . actually , you won &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of things like this , but they don &apos;t get much .
we need solutions , either one or a number of times , and we have a unimaginable scaling and unimaginable government , and even though there are many directions where people are looking for , i really see five , which can do this big demands .
i &apos;ve left tides , and i have a fusion , fusion and biofuels .
and maybe these are a moderate contribution , and if you expect better than i expect , it &apos;s great , but my punch line here is that we need to work on all of these five , and we can &apos;t give them a significant one because they
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels , burning from either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there is just , you know , it &apos;s just not , but it &apos;s not . you have to have all the co2 that comes from the burning of the intangible , under pressure , and then you hope that there &apos;s still
there are some of the most important things that are going on on a 60 percent -- 80 percent of the way , but it &apos;s going to be 100 percent of the time , and a lot of a time to get the co2 is a big challenge
who will make it make sure ?
who can guarantee something that literally many billion times larger than any kind of waste you can imagine from the other kind of garbage and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a tough problem .
next : the next thing .
it has three great problems , the cost , especially in the world , in the most highly developed countries , the question for security , that you can really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human involvement that the fuel is not used for weapons
and what do you do with the garbage ?
because although it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work .
the last three of the five i put in .
it &apos;s the renewables that are often called the renewables .
and also , even though it &apos;s great , it &apos;s not that you need no fuel -- you have some drawbacks .
one is the energy density that creates these technologies dramatically than the power of power .
these are the most powerful , you &apos;re talking about many of the most powerful , 1,000 times more area than a normal power power .
and also , these sources of uninterrupted sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem to be all day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be the wind every day , and it doesn &apos;t always blow the wind .
so you have to be dependent on these sources , you have a way to have energy in times when you &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s great data here . there are challenges in transmission , and if we say that the energy source is outside the country , you don &apos;t need to just have the technology , you have to deal with the risk of where different from it .
and there &apos;s the most important thing .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve all been able to look at the kinds of batteries that are made , the computer , computers , mobile phones , mobile phones , for everything , and i found that all the batteries that we &apos;re producing now ,
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that will be a factor of 100 better than the approaches to the time .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
that &apos;s what happens when you try to say that these are the vents that we &apos;re trying to say about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest of the rest .
if you want to get 100 percent of it , you need an incredible amount of energy .
now , where should we go : what is the right approach ?
&quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the target ?
what we need is many companies working on it . hundreds of them .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
so , in many of you , they &apos;re going to say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there &apos;s a lot of people in the ted group that already have been engaged there .
bill big has several companies , among other people , who have a great job of the great world .
and the most interesting thing is , invest in dozens of companies , and they have the great things , and i &apos;m trying to support it .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that , maybe surprisingly , is the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the field of affairs ; it &apos;s liquid , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry a few times , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts are lying around .
the most important thing is that instead of one part of the world &apos;s brain , you have one percent that &apos;s the most important , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the most important .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it , but you could never simulate any reasonable , whether it would work , but since it &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that , yes , it &apos;s going to be a way of
and because you burn these 99 percent , it &apos;s a lot better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of the waste of today as a function of reactors .
instead of breaking the head , they just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is consumed gradually , a little bit like a candle .
you see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often as a &quot; traveling wave reactor . &quot;
that really solves the most important thing .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called the uranium uranium .
the shoots for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re cheap and just more , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
how should our testimony look ?
now , let &apos;s go to the destination that we have to do and then talk about the most important .
many talk from a 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something agriculture is going to be , hopefully , and it &apos;s going to be clean to the cement .
so to get this 80 percent , the developed world , including countries like china , is completely changing .
the other grade says whether we use the technology technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is going to be a key version of this .
if we go back from there , how should the 2020 look at the 2020 ?
it should be the two elements again .
we should use the most sophisticated use to bring reduction on the way . the less we &apos;re going to be the lower , the lower , the cost of the temperature , and also the temperature .
but actually , this note for the things we do is not completely to the big , not the big ones , just right , or even less important than the other , which is the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
we have to follow these breakthroughs with the very estate and we can measure that : in the blink of the world , in the field of food and the water .
there are many great books to this topic .
the al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david &apos;s energy , &quot; and david &apos;s energy &apos;s energy . &quot;
they &apos;re really going through and create a frame where this can be discussed , because we need to support all the pages of all sides .
there &apos;s a lot of things that have to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very concrete wish , that we invent this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose this wish , which is , i could take this wish , that &apos;s the desire to take
this has the largest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the dig of the long time , people are going to be terrible in the long term , and the most short time , between the united states and china , between poor and rich , and almost all of these
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do ?
we need to use for more research research .
if countries are meeting in places like the world , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should talk to these kinds of things , and they were shocked by the ridiculous few funds that are spent for these innovative approaches .
we need to control carbon dioxide , carbon &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; / em &amp; amp ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp;
we need to spread the message .
we need to have a rational deal and we have to have a whole lot of work and the things that are going to be done by government .
it &apos;s a very important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand a little bit better -- first , can you give us a sense of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , all the great scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we just need some 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure it &apos;s a reasonable way to do
the difficult step is building the first parking , more billion , and the place of the place that actually builds the first of these .
once the first thing is , when he &apos;s going to go like this , it &apos;s all very clear , because the economic energy is so different as the energy system , as we know it .
to understand that right , that means to build deep in the ground almost like a vertical column nuclear energy , that uses this , and then the process starts up and works on the top ?
so , the point is , right . you have to get the reactor new , so there &apos;s a lot of people and lots of control that can go wrong . this thing where you open it and make things out of it , and it &apos;s not
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can do it for 60 years -- think of a column -- that you &apos;re buried without all the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there and it &apos;s going to be 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
a key solution , the self , offers a solution to the garbage .
so , yes , yes . well , what happens to the garbage : you can sit in it -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the waste , which is already exists in these areas , or the reactors in these lines , and that &apos;s our main system .
so , what &apos;s a problem for these reactors was what we put in our fill and it &apos;s going to reduce the most dramatic , as this process is dramatically reduced during this process .
but while they &apos;ve talked about different people in the world over these possibilities .
where is the biggest interest , what really makes it really ?
so , we &apos;ve got a lot of the time , and we &apos;ve got a lot of interesting things to do that , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting things that are called the nuclear &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there &apos;s big interest and
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is a version of one thing that was made .
this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries built this , so everyone who has a quick reactor , a quick reactor , is a very quick one for our first .
in your mind , you know , the way that you &apos;re going to do something really in life ?
so , the question is , we need one of these most amazing , more powerful things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to use .
this is basically the deadline that has shown us the most powerful , which we need to follow .
and , you know , the , you know , if everything goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could hold it easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of things that , as the process of working , the way that they work , they can work for their pilots , to work for their pilots .
and it would be best if it could do multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
and the great amount of breakthroughs , is this the biggest one you know ?
so , the most important thing is , a key thing is the most important .
it would have been without the most important , but it &apos;s still more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know how to do this as well as these , but there &apos;s the modular method that &apos;s another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid water system that seems to be a little bit difficult , but maybe the one that &apos;s going to say about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the beautiful thing about it is that a million times a million times as much energy as a , say , a design and therefore , if you can handle the problems and the cost of the world , the potential ,
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to introduce the data to try to keep the most stable stable ?
so , if you get into this situation , it &apos;s like you eat too much , and you &apos;re just a heart attack , and you &apos;re going to do a heart attack , you might need a heart attack or something .
there &apos;s a research that calls the most important thing that &apos;s going to be involved with different techniques to delay warming , so we &apos;ve got 20 or 30 years longer to get us out of it .
this is just a single one .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t work at all , because maybe you &apos;re going to do it , so you &apos;re going to eat , because you know that you &apos;re going to save the heart rate .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s smart if you &apos;re going to get the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in the field of time , whether you should have that available , if things are getting faster , or that innovation needs longer
climate change : have you a or two sentences for the , to convince you ?
so , the skeptics : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
those who make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say there &apos;s negative effects that have to do with the clouds that are moving things ?
there are very , very few things you can say at all , from which there is a chance in a million .
the problem here is that it &apos;s like aids .
you &apos;re doing the mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of problems , to invest in something that you only have -- and that &apos;s the investment that is not so clear , and that &apos;s not necessarily the ipcc report , and there &apos;s people
the fact is that uncertainty should be worried about us .
but my dream here is that if you can do it economically , and the co2 is also blown up , then the skeptics says , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not a co2 , i wish it &apos;s not a co2 , i wish it &apos;s cheaper than
and that would be their answer to the most important argument that if you use all of these time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals that suffer , the most common , the most common , is to invest in the resources that
so , the real time , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year than they do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
it shouldn &apos;t suffer other things underneath .
you get to big sums of money , and here you can disagree with reasonable people if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and trying to fund that . for me , most of the waste is going to be the waste of waste .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re very short of a design and funded only learning learning , and i think we should try to do more things that have the potential to be very much cheaper .
if the cloudy , you get a very high , very high , very high , you can only keep the rich .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even more , it &apos;s thinking about .
his new york is now : &quot; why don &apos;t research be more talking ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to be because of his former stories , with the most common , but he understood that this is a very lonely group and therefore it &apos;s going to get the most lonely group .
and that &apos;s a train that i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , as little people will support .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about almost all people here , if i say , i really hope you will be true . thank you very much .
so , thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , peter mcchrystal asked a computer named &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
the idea is quite simple . the highest one needs to be the highest structure of the structure with 20 spaghetti tape , about three feet , and building a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be up .
and , although it really seems to be really easy , it &apos;s really hard to work because people are doing very quickly .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a plastic scanner .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , engineers and architects , even with the most powerful and there &apos;s something that makes deep sensations in nature , and i want to share some of them .
usually most people start to get themselves to the task .
they talk about it , they &apos;re going to look at how it &apos;s going to look , they &apos;re going to make it .
then you invest a little bit in planning and organization , and you draw spaghetti .
they &apos;re investing in the most sophisticated structures in the world &apos;s business .
and finally , before you don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow and they put it carefully on the top , step back and forth , and &quot; do you know , &quot; and &quot; do you know ? &quot;
but then , almost always , it &apos;s happening , that the &quot; the &quot; s &quot; is going to be a &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the marshmallow &quot; is that the whole thing is going to bend and the
there &apos;s a series of people who have much more &quot; born &quot; moments than others , and under the worst are fresh , fresh food .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and they really make a little bit of things .
and of course , there are teams that have much more , more &quot; more &quot; and the best ones are fresh students &apos; worth of fresh school .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , they didn &apos;t just make the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is : how does this come ? why ? what about those ?
and peter says , &quot; no one of the kids spend a boss at the time of being a cat &apos;s day . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest at a time in the field of time .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that &apos;s that the fact that the training system was trained to find a proper plan , ok !
and then it turns out to be aware .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s different is that they start to start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , so they have a lot of the opportunity to repair the possibility of fixing prototypes .
and the way that we see this kind of collaboration is that the core of a brain &apos;s brain is going to be able to be able to figure out .
and with every trial , the kids get immediately feedback , and what doesn &apos;t .
so the performance of working with prototypes , much -- but we see how different teams are acting .
the average for most of the time is about the most important , and the half of them are creating a little more , but not much , but not much , more sophisticated than adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
the top is the highest thing i saw .
and why ? because they understand triangles and they &apos;re the key geometric patterns to build robust structures .
ceos are something about average . but here &apos;s what it &apos;s interesting .
you put an environmental administrator on the team , you &apos;re going to be significant better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see about it , and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why is this ?
because they have special skills of the internet .
they &apos;re running the process , they understand it .
and this team , which is going to regulate and look at the work of the team , the performance of the team .
and these are specialized skills and the combination of success and their combination .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six , which have robust structures .
i tried something interesting now .
i thought we &apos;re going to get the same thing .
so i offered a $ 10,000 price of software for the winner .
what happened to these kinds of things ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone had built a high construction , he would have carried the price home .
so is it not interesting that high amounts of energy have a strong effect ?
we repeated this practice with the same students .
what happened now ?
now they understood the advantage of the prototyping .
so , from the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there &apos;s a lot of lessons for us , and we &apos;re going to be aware of nature , and success .
you might ask : why would someone actually invest time to create a more powerful ?
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and &quot; visual , &quot; to create .
and what the most important thing is , it &apos;s going to be hidden to identify you .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge provides a common experience , a common language , or a stance to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in the can go to the ground .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how you build the marshmallow .
there &apos;s a more powerful one there .
they find crazy examples of all the world , like people optimize the system and the system of the system .
there are also also more sophisticated .
and the most important lesson i think is , i think , is a really important sport .
it requires that we all have our senses to the task and we think we &apos;re using our thinking of how our emotions and our minds are , in the challenge that we &apos;re facing .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is all that it takes us to bring us from a &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; moment &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so let &apos;s have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to be in .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what they would choose because i asked my friends recently , and they wanted to go all the time .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there was cars or twitter or &quot; america &quot; or &quot; america . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i believe that you &apos;re kind of drawn to the nostalgia , to be drawn to the vietnamese .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a explorers .
it &apos;s because possibilities are not going back to this planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that ever had on this planet , no matter what scale you do : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining , declining .
there was never a time before that .
my favorite group died all of them as they were 60 .
my grandparents , in the number of 70 , enjoyed this number .
my parents are the 80 on the top of the road .
so there should be a nine of the nine times in my front room .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child that can be born in new delhi today , as long as the richest man on the world is 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is this ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;ve been shaped the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we &apos;ve defeated them . pop .
in the rich world , diseases that have millions of us only have a generation of time , not yet .
so , the polio system , polio , polio ...
anybody even know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try and look at things , if it works , it changes if it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the great achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s the whole good news , because there &apos;s a couple of other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned often .
and one of them is that despite all our achievements , we &apos;re going to go to bed every day in the world every day .
this number goes up , and it &apos;s very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to trash the world .
drinking water , land land , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , and if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , we &apos;re also going to go out and get ourselves out of this chaos .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that they don &apos;t actually kill .
i think that really , and no , that &apos;s not a rocket &apos;s .
but this is a little bit awake at night -- one of the things that hold me awake at night . we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress yet , never yet , never yet , never yet , never yet .
and we &apos;ve never been able to make it reasonable , as we can now .
we &apos;re at the threshold of amazing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think we have to go back hundreds , 300 years before the enlightenment to find a time where we have progress in progress , in which we have a lot of
people are going to hang on their faith , and that &apos;s how they can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth is going to free it .
and listen , everybody has a right to think about it ; even a fairly right thing to do .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
they don &apos;t have a right on their own facts . &apos; sorry , they don &apos;t have .
and i took a while to figure out that .
about a decade ago , i wrote a paper about algae for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a little article .
and i was amazed to hit resistance , on resistance , to what the most effective activity in health care is in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote a paper and drove .
and soon , i wrote a paper about genetically engineered food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i also wrote a paper about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; the &quot; s &quot; , why they believed that molecules were a certain kind of a random way to move around the field of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept doing it .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re going to eat a , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but this article made me worry , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these fellows who were crazy at all , they didn &apos;t have a toxin at all .
these were people who were educated people , educated people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that &apos;s what i got ...
but then i thought , you know what , we &apos;re honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking ironic about this , with little quotes , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what the reasons are .
we have trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
chernobyl , the challenger , the lxd , the light , mass destruction , the most powerful 2,000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people that we believed that they were always right . so , they &apos;re skeptical .
ask questions , ask the evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything like that .
but now , if you have to get evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can say that we &apos;re now living in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully never see .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that the most terrifying story that was the most prolific , and the vaccine , and the vaccine , brought in a connection .
very scary .
so , lots of studies were done to see if that was true .
so , there are lots of studies that are done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came out of the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we think we &apos;re doing , what makes us feel really .
we don &apos;t believe in a cluster of documents of a plastic that gives us data , and i understand that , i think , we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was devastating .
catastrophic because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where immunization is falling for malnutrition .
this is a little bit of a time , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happened is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because here &apos;s somebody who &apos;s got malnutrition ?
has one in the audience ever seen someone die of malnutrition ?
not very often .
in this country , it &apos;s not happening at all , but shame is in the world last year .
these are a lot of deaths by exports , 20 per hour .
but because this is not happening here , we can do it , and people like jenny can walk around and see messages from fear and illiteracy from the platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and you can do that because you don &apos;t connect the cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same thing .
and that &apos;s something that we need to learn , and that &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he was born from one of the worst things that humanity &apos;s worst .
no fear , no distress , polio , pop , disappeared .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t like that .
he &apos;s called paul &apos;s .
he &apos;s just developed a few other people &apos;s worth of time .
he can save the lives of the world &apos;s lives 500,000 , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul travels around and talking about vaccines and say , how valuable they are , and that people should just stop complaining .
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul talks in a public public , he can &apos;t tell without arms guards .
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where their children go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
you take them away , return the diseases , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s what happens .
we have now now juarez .
and that &apos;s going to be worse , and pretty soon kids die again , because this is just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die on malnutrition .
what about polio ? do we take that . why not ?
a few weeks ago , i wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i said i &apos;m a little too sharp .
nobody ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against polio . no one .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
we had no polio in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe this morning someone in lagos , and you &apos;re going to fly in a plane , and you &apos;re just going to los angeles , right now , it &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he lands and he &apos;s a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these most delicious things tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a devastating disease , and we don &apos;t know , because this is how the world works now .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love to fit in lies . we love that .
do you all have your vitamins tomorrow ?
and the small thing that helps you do is to get a little bit of a little bit of a bow .
i know that they did that because half the americans do it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference , how often we find out that they &apos;re useless .
the data is all the time .
they make their urine . more than they do .
this is okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i &apos;m going to give you a completely .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate a strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and that &apos;s not what we should do . our healthcare system is 450 .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing , and it &apos;s amazing to us that can afford to do it .
so we &apos;re going away , and where do we walk ?
we &apos;re running into the poor of the world &apos;s arms .
that &apos;s great . i love the most popular .
but you know , this is really a serious issue , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars for it .
and i &apos;ve all got a little bit of little confusion here .
none of them -- the -- , i was , was , &quot; -- i &apos;m not even sure what that is , &quot; i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s been .
and you know what ? if i say that , people say , &quot; what cares ? let &apos;s do the people , what they want .
so they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you have wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the health minister , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to be the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or any of the people who want to treat his patients with a little bit of their
if you &apos;re going to go on this way , where and magic and magic , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to the south africa in south africa .
he brought 400,000 of his people to be because he was in the case that red , and the red , and more effective than antiretroviral drugs , are from which we know that they can take the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country that will be worse than any other of these disease .
please don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the most popular epidemic that we &apos;re currently facing is this ridiculous struggle between the world &apos;s rights , and the most powerful struggle .
this is a debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every single branch , every branch of serenity , every unit of serenity , has been changed by the people .
you know , there was no more high-tech in paradise .
there was no food .
there was no street . we did all this .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them has worked and some of them don &apos;t .
we &apos;re rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more closely , and of course , there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people to increase millions of people , their lives .
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re bending to be genetically modified food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m constantly hearing is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , hormones , we don &apos;t want a huge area with one thing that is wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . we fix that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge amount of energy , but that &apos;s not science .
that &apos;s not to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , the math .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes he works and sometimes not , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we &apos;re afraid of doing a really dead , and it &apos;s holding millions of people from the flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than right now . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
adam . adam .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? genetically changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this kind of thing , like , for example , to eat .
it &apos;s a little bit of a billion people eating food .
it &apos;s about a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s 450 .
it has no nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have any protein , and scientists are building all this in it .
and then people could eat the food and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be janine panisse , but it would be beautiful .
and all i can say to this is : why do we fight that ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask , why do we fight that ?
because we don &apos;t want to move genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our contributions on greater food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice &apos;s rice , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do so on , we &apos;re going to be guilty of something that we think , i don &apos;t want to be guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of our being worthy , and we really need to stop it .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; you &apos;re still going to go into this ridiculous time and go into the future ? &quot;
anyway , i want to do that anyway .
now , in the present , you &apos;re in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time time on everything we want .
we can move them out where we want to move them , and we will move them where we want .
we need to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the time time and go into the future , we &apos;re going to be happy to have that .
i know we can , and as far as it is , it &apos;s something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been interested in the most interested in the world &apos;s office , and it may seem strange that a magician is interested in it , because it &apos;s like i think it &apos;s like a deception that &apos;s going to be a little bit of a real
in other words , sugar sugar has shown a measurable effect , the most powerful , and that &apos;s just because the person thinks what happens to her , is a kind of a , or a kind of ... in the middle of the body , there &apos;s
a deception becomes something real because somebody is so aware of it .
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least since the 1950s in every single country &apos;s book .
i learned it from the most violent magic magic of the world &apos;s 70s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can study , my hand , which you can study .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my hand .
i push my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or out of him , i &apos;m just going to get my wrist right here .
you can see that you can &apos;t move anything at any time , and as long as i &apos;m here , there &apos;s nothing in my sleeve , or you can get out of it .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will put through my naked physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually sitting in his place that i can shake it , without that knife .
nothing goes into my sleeve or come out , no more , no more powerful , and you can study everything .
so , the math .
now , this is a trick i often put on young kids , which are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception when you look closely , although it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
he works like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to make my wrist , to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or come out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m going to get my wrist is that it &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
so in the moment , where i &apos;m going to get my hand from you , so you &apos;re going to see it from the back , this finger is moving here , my fred , just from there , where he was so extended .
great trick ?
there &apos;s someone behind that , who had no childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i &apos;m going to go , the fingers change his position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there &apos;s only three fingers down here , because the mind and the way it &apos;s information is that it &apos;s not going to be a group of information , it
but this is not what it &apos;s about , and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s going to be held there , but not by magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my hobby , that &apos;s there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing happens by letting me go through this movement , that the fingers will be more restrained .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can show you your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does this have to do with the design system ?
a year or something , i read a study that really blew me up .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why i was an amazing thing for me .
and it turns out that if you offer a placebo placebo in a white pill , in the form of a brain , it &apos;s just a round , white pill , which has a particular effect .
but if you give the shape that you give the placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and this blue color is actually folding and a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurable .
and that , although none of them are -- it &apos;s just sugar .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really got me crazy .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
if you take a haircut , you &apos;re more effective than any form of any form .
a colored capsule , which is at a end of yellow and on the other red , is better than a white capsule .
also , the dosage plays a role .
a pill twice is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is ...
... that also the doses of play is a role .
and the shape is playing a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate consumer , you have to reach to the needle .
right ? a syringe with a computer company -- a few of the most cosmopolitan of a brain that you &apos;re being hacked to .
this creates a very strong picture in your head , and this is a lot stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a projection .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill , which doesn &apos;t seem so good as a capsule , which doesn &apos;t seem so good as the needle .
and none of it has really been a really valid property . it &apos;s just our belief that we can get into a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i take something that &apos;s obvious , and i &apos;m going to take it really look .
we know from that study that you have to reach to the needle if it &apos;s going to go to the thing .
this is a long time of long time , and it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very clear . and i &apos;m going to first do a little bit of it .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not a special cultural meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin and run through them , until they put it back on the other side .
if you &apos;re going to be bad -- if you drop lightly -- i &apos;ve taken a couple of friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and i have a woman almost powerless .
so i &apos;m suggesting if you &apos;re going to be quick , you &apos;ll look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first sensitive part here .
you can see it right , but you can also see it , if you want .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my flesh starts , at the bottom of my arm , i just make a little barbs .
i &apos;m really sorry . does it make you crazy ?
and now just a little bit of my skin and on the other side , it &apos;s like this .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the same situation .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see this .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid and the skin itself , just to talk to us a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;ll show you .
how does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people back to the back , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see that right . &quot;
people in the world &apos;s office are now coming in .
let me show you from the close .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood .
this is my flesh , and i can rotate this .
sorry . if you &apos;re bad , you &apos;re looking at it , don &apos;t look at it .
people back to the back or the ones that eventually see video , say , &quot; well , this is quite impressive , but if it &apos;s real , it would be a hole , and it would be , if it really would be real , it would
okay , let me just give you a little blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
i would usually take the needle out .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this frame here , and with the intention of a deception , i &apos;m going to just make a needle in there , and i &apos;m going to go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to meet a couple of times in the next days .
i hope you &apos;re looking at it . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness today .
i have some people who are counting the number of books that were published with happiness in the title of the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of information .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these tide of work , there are several cognitive cognitive sharks that make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly going to act from these cognitive acts .
that &apos;s true of terms of terms of the world &apos;s own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are just as mess as any other .
the first of these fall is a very , very creative , complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a useful word , because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could just narrow it up , but in the big and all the large and all that is something we need to give up , and we will have to think of the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is a state of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s between happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both the most powerful in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the most important thing , and that &apos;s the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that affects well-being without its significance .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now i &apos;d like to start with a sample of someone who had a family company after one of my lectures , who was telling a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and it was
and then he added , really emotionally , really emotionally , that has been ruined all the experience .
but that didn &apos;t have it .
what it had been ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of music .
they don &apos;t care because he was a memory of memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to keep .
what &apos;s really telling us that we could think about ourselves and thinking about other people in the sense of two species of self .
there &apos;s a more powerful self that lives in the present and the present , is able to experience the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the most important self that the doctor &apos;s doctor -- you know , if the doctor says , &quot; well , does it hurt if i &apos;m going to get you here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a more powerful self , and the most important self is that the most important and the story of our lives is going to be upright , and it &apos;s that , the doctor is going to be the question , &quot; how did you
or &quot; how did their journey go to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the most powerful self , and the most important self , and the two is part of the most powerful of the world &apos;s happiness .
now , the most important self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we do to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories that means what we can keep from our experiences .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s a old study .
these are real patients who are doing a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds of their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who &apos;s got more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b clearly suffered more . his favorite , and every minute of pain , the patient a patient had a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a much worse had a much worse to the patient &apos;s disease than a patient b.
the stories of the world &apos;s book were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how they end .
and not that stories is very , very popular or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is clear than the other .
and the worse is the one that was the pain of the very end on his peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people to be asked , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing in total ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than b in the prison industry .
now , this is a direct conflict between the self self and the most prolific self .
from the point of view of the computer self , b clearly had a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s working , you could actually get the patient &apos;s license of a reduction by just putting the tube in it without too much
that &apos;s going to lead the patient , but only a little bit less than before .
and if you do a few minutes , you make that the most important self is a bad thing , and you have a bad thing to do , and you have a much better thing to do , because you have a patient &apos;s own better story about
what &apos;s a story ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that gives us memory and it &apos;s true for the stories that we invent .
and what a story is , is , you know , significant moments and the end .
end is very , very important and in this case , the end is dominated .
now , the most important self lives forever .
it has moments of the design , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve got this -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds . what means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a month , and most of them don &apos;t
most of you will completely ignore the most of the time .
and yet , you get the impression that you should count that what happens during this moments of the world &apos;s life is our lives .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use as we are on this world .
and as we would use them , it seems to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the most important self for us .
so we have the most important self , and the most important self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is the time .
from the point of view of the day , if you have a vacation and the second week is exactly as good as the first , then the most powerful vacation is twice as good as the holidays vacation .
this is not how it works at all for the most important self .
for the most important self , a holiday is barely better than the most prolific vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories of the memories .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable , which is different from a brain itself , which is a very different self , and time has very little influence on this story .
well , the most important self is making more than remember and stories .
it &apos;s actually the same thing that makes decisions , because if you have a patient who , we have two different surgeons , and decide what he should choose to choose , then the one who &apos;s going to choose the memory that &apos;s less bad and that
the most important self has no voice in this choice .
we &apos;re not actually choosing between experiences . we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as a experience .
we think about our future as a human being .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the brain itself , and you can think of the most important self as one , which is kind of the most important self , which is not needed to be the most
i have the impression that if we &apos;re doing a holiday , it &apos;s very often , that means we &apos;re doing vacation in the service of the world &apos;s market .
and that &apos;s a little bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much do we get from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that will be given for the dominance of the ocean itself .
and if i think about it , i think about a vacation that we did a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i had ever had , and i think relatively often in relation to how often i think of other people .
and i probably have about my memories of this kind of journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had opened the folder with 600 pictures in it , i spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s just a half hours .
there seems to be a disagreement .
now , i like a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the top of memories , but even if you &apos;re doing more of it , why do we give it a real question , why do we give the memories of the
so i want you to think about a thought of thought .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the ted system , all your images are being wiped out , and you get a drug , so you &apos;re not going to remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you choose a different vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species of self and you have to think about how you decide this conflict and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think of the memories of time , you can get
why we choose the most sophisticated , which we choose is a problem that is a choice between the two species of self .
now , the two types of self , two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts from happiness that we can apply to one self .
so you can ask : how happy is the most important self ?
and then you would ask , how happy are the moments of the life of the self ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
which is the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of happiness from the time of the time .
if you &apos;re lucky to ask yourself , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this is not how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or delighted is the person when this person thinks about their lives .
very different term .
everybody who &apos;s not different is going to be the study of happiness , and i &apos;m one of the researchers in the world , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers who have been blown up the study of happiness .
the distinction between happiness itself and the happiness of the self &apos;s own is recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re going to be able to measure the two interventions .
the gallup organization has a global survey , which has been asked more than half a million people to ask about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started learning about the happiness of the two species .
and the main lesson we think i learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and it really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation that is related to the correlation .
what that means is that if you meet somebody and you would tell you , oh , his father is a kind of a , like how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody has been in a scale of 10 to a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his own own self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what happiness is defined by the most of the time .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness means being satisfied with people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two species of self , you &apos;re going to do very different things .
the conclusion of what i said here is that we really shouldn &apos;t imagine ourselves as a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very quickly , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are going to be in california , they don &apos;t get the correct answer .
if you think of this question , people have to be happier in california if they say , in ohio , we &apos;re living in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the most important self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the appropriate self , which decides how happy people are .
but , because the bonus self is responsible , you can at the end -- some people could go to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track what happens to people who are going to go to california , happier .
now , your favorite self is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think that you &apos;re happier , because if you &apos;re going to think about it , you &apos;ll be reminded how awful the weather was in ohio . and you &apos;ll feel that you &apos;ve made the right decision
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve got a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we talked about a couple of weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this gallup survey .
is that something you can do to connect us , because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel libeskind : sure .
i think the most interesting thing we found in the gallup survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find absolutely .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
if we looked at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out that under a income income , for americans , and that &apos;s a very big sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars a year in a year of 600,000 dollars a
60,000 .
so , 60,000 : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year are unhappy , and they &apos;re getting more happy , the poorer they will be .
we get a perfectly flat line .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money doesn &apos;t raise a more sustainable , but lack of money certainly fed misery , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the most important self , you get another story .
the more money you deserve is the more likely you do .
it &apos;s not true for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american effort , is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people take this kind of thing seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on the head , everything we believe in terms of , for example , in terms of the way we think about it and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country is generally taking a more serious way to take the serious and make politics based on politics ?
so , you know , you know , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of the world &apos;s role in politics .
the recognition will be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the u.k. , it &apos;s happening and in other countries , they just happen .
people are in the process of thinking that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it will take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study the way they want to study or whether they want to study the discussion , so we have to have this discussion quite soon .
how to get lucky to be able to depend on how they think and whether they think about the most important self or whether they think about the most important self .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you &apos;re going to be able to measure the population of the population .
this is going to be , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this topic , or should be at least the most interesting political debate to track the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny ornish .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in reality , as you &apos;re in the rescue of the world .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince you more people , including all of them , more time with play larger and more and more powerful .
now we spend three billion hours a week with a little bit of time .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a whole lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute of the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week are not nearly enough to solve the most common problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increase this time dramatically .
i &apos;ve calculated that the time that it &apos;s needed at 21 billion hours per week .
this may be a little bit of an intellectual , so i &apos;ll repeat it , so that if we &apos;re looking at problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try to play games online for at
no , i really mean it seriously .
why ? this picture is quite exactly why i think games are so critical for survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographers phil b.c.
he wanted to capture the feelings of play . so he made a camera built on the players .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you may be able to get some of the nuances of the nuances .
you probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also very hard concentration , very much , in the way , to solve a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re playing , you see some nuances here , which is the top of the eyes , and the mouth is a sign of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of a call called a epic counter .
oh , you know that . ok . so , so we have some players here .
a patent victory is a result that is so incredibly positive that it &apos;s not possible before that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you reach it , you &apos;re shocked that you &apos;re actually able to do something like this . that &apos;s a kind of a victory victory .
this player is a little bit of a epic victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces from the world &apos;s face , if we take the barriers of the next century , and the face of the next century is standing in the edge of a epic ball .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re looking at this face in real life when we &apos;re looking at difficult problems .
i call it the &quot; in life , &quot; i &apos;m bad , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok .
i &apos;m like , &quot; in life i &apos;m bad &quot; to make it bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. why we &apos;re better in play than in the real life .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not so good in reality as well as play .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , although that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
we &apos;re going to get more . i mean , i mean , in the context of motivation , something significant to do , inspired with collaboration .
if we &apos;re in a corporate factory , i believe that many of us are turning into our best version , anytime and immediately , to solve the problem , trying to solve the problem as long as necessary , and try to try it back to the bottom
and in reality , if we fail to make it , we feel often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or unnecessary .
we never have these feelings , if we play games , there &apos;s just not .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible to think , you can &apos;t just get anything to do ?
how can we actually transfer these feelings from the play in the reality ?
so i looked like the world of warcraft , which offers the ideal environment to the collaborative problem .
and i &apos;ve noticed some things that the epic wins in the art of the art can be able to do .
so first , if you get in one of these most popular , especially world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to give you a mission mission , and that &apos;s immediately .
but not only any mission , but a mission that fits perfect to your current level in the game , right ?
so they do that .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of your capabilities , so you have to be working . but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and you &apos;re going to turn it around . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are tons of staff .
where they &apos;re also going , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to end their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that easy in life , this feeling that in a sense of a high staff , they &apos;re ready to stand .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , these inspiring history , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve been in &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + a strength &quot; or &quot; + one intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not true in real life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t say , + 1 , and a crazy idea , + 20 kooks , and 20 kooks .
i don &apos;t get the real life of this feedback .
so the problem of the world &apos;s problems like the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying , at the edge of a epic ball of a epic , that we &apos;re rather spending our whole time in these online centers .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
until today , all the world of the world &apos;s population has spent millions of years of solving the virtual problems of the world &apos;s virtual problems .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound nasty .
but to see it in context , the first time we started to go back to the first time of the world , our first ted plan began to go upright .
so the first nearby primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend playing with play , it just makes sense when you keep the time in terms of the scale of human development , what &apos;s extraordinary .
but also , it &apos;s also true , because it turns out we &apos;re using this whole time to play , actually , changing what we &apos;re capable of as humans .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative thinking , very , very , very .
that &apos;s the truth . i think it &apos;s .
look at this interesting statistic , which was published recently from a researcher of carnegie mellon university : the average boy of today in a country with a strong computer age of a country with a huge age of life to the 21st century .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , the very precise hours of the united states are the exact precise ones that they spend in school , from the fifth school to the degree of high school .
so we have a complete set of water , on the young people , which means that it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; &quot; aw , &quot; read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of the world &apos;s research that if we spend 10,000 hours with the compelling study of any subject to the 21st of the 21st century , we will be aware of it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what &apos;s the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are the most powerful .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players driving up ? &quot;
because if we could figure out that , we would have never been able to have a human potential to get available .
so many people are currently in the world , who spend at least one hour per day with a child &apos;s day .
these are our main programs . 500 million people who are extraordinary in &quot; something &quot; are .
and the next decade we have another billion players who are extraordinary at what &apos;s also happening .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the most powerful design industry , the energy , is saving energy and work on the ground , rather than the most powerful , so players on the world , especially in india , china , brazil , online .
you expect a more billion player in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players in the whole way .
so i started thinking about what it is to do , what are these games to do .
here &apos;s the four things i found . first of all , the first thing that i found .
ok , imagine how extreme the extreme of the most extreme .
so , the desire is to do something , immediately to do something , to master , to think that we have an educated hope to succeed .
player always believe that a more powerful victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to try and try and do it .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in spiders in spiders .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show us people , after we &apos;ve played them , even if they &apos;ve been defeated with them , even if they &apos;ve defeated us .
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that somebody has time to spend that the rules are being honored , that we have the same goal , and to the end of the way .
so the most important thing is that the user &apos;s growing , trust and others .
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
it &apos;s great productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the most important of the ted system is playing 22 hours a week , as a result of a matter of time .
the reason is , if we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than we &apos;re going to relax or not .
we know that as human beings , we &apos;re going to be able to do the optimal thing , if we do hard , significant work .
and players are always ready to work hard if they get the right job .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to be part of awe of awe of the other way to be a lot of awe .
here &apos;s a key thing to go to the right light , and you know all wikipedia , the largest wiki of the world .
the second largest wiki world , with almost 80,000 entries , is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about the world of warcraft in the internet than any other topic in each other &apos;s other wiki world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to one single outcome . players are the ones that are hopeful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as a single one .
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real thing .
that &apos;s the problem i try to solve .
edward ornish is a computer designer .
his work is great . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in the field of food .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to be a witness of a more than a more than a more successful in virtual worlds and the world . &quot;
and that &apos;s an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like me -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit more nuanced .
so he says that actually makes sense , because players can achieve more than in the real life .
you can do stronger social bonds than in real life , and you get more feedback and rewards in play as in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s completely logical that players are more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not a trivial thing .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s about 2,500 years ago .
there are these ancient cube , from the ground , you know ?
this fantastic computer was called the street .
and that was the first of the people developed in the first way .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the old greek , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to the sound of games , games were actually invented , more specifically , in the kingdom of famine .
there was such a great famine that was meant to be a great famine , that the king of the u.s.
people suffered . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to the most loud , the most popular and chief , a national strategy , and one day , you would eat food . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the way that they were in the field of games , because they &apos;re so fascinating and we &apos;re with the food of the , they &apos;re surrounded by the food , they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day , you would play . and the next day you would eat food .
and according to the other day , they survived this famine for 18 years , and they were playing in a day and played the next .
so , i think we &apos;re playing games today .
we &apos;re putting games to the suffering of the real world .
we &apos;re putting games to get everything to be able to do that in the real world , not being satisfying in real life , and we &apos;re going to get what we need from play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting .
according to 18 years , the famine was not better , so the king decided , a last year , a final school project .
they shared the kingdom in two halves .
they were playing a computer company and they were able to break the best adventure to a epic adventure .
they left out and they went to search for a new home , and they just decided to go back so many people , like food , and they were looking at the rest of the place where they could flourish .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest research shows that the most popular , the one that &apos;s later made the roman empire , the same dna as the old sea .
so scientists recently came to the notion that the crazy story is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global cooling , which was almost 20 years , which could explain famine .
so this crazy story could be true .
you might have saved your people by playing with your people by playing 18 years in games and then had this kind of thing that they had , and so much about that , they &apos;ve been rescued by the entire civilization .
so , we can also .
we &apos;ve been playing since 1994 .
this was the first ted project in real time of the world of the world &apos;s world , and that was 16 years ago .
they were playing for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i &apos;m going to say we &apos;re ready for our own game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion a week .
we should be able to have a lot of arrangements that half of us spend an hour with play , until we solved the problems of real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of real world in games ? &quot; and that question i have spent my work in the last few years on the institute .
we have this flag in our office in palo alto , it &apos;s like we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to think of the best result , and then people make sure that this idea of doing this is in reality .
we &apos;re going to take a dive of epic and give people the possibilities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you a very short three games that i &apos;ve designed to try to get people to take people &apos;s epic epic in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a computer that you have to overcome a little bit of a car .
the key thing is , but we have enough food tools , so it &apos;s realistic for them , and they actually live their real life without oil , so if they &apos;re beating , they &apos;re going to tell us where they &apos;re going to be , and
we tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied by the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a change experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure , and you &apos;re going to say , &quot; we &apos;re going to go out of oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going to go .
find out how they were going to survive . most of our players have been involved in the game .
so we have a bigger game for the next game , and we put a bigger , higher goal than just the only time .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; the &quot; s &quot; on the institute of the future .
the point is computation &apos;s computation that people have only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global warming , &quot; of course .
the call of gamers , we have a little bit of a &quot; the &quot; machine &quot; designed , we &apos;re doing a &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you know jerry &apos;s , where there &apos;s the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; s &quot; -- they have the astronauts , the scientists , the most educated and only together they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody is in the most violent , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they google &quot; the &quot;
and the last game we get on march , and it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the award of the world bank , &quot; social engineering , &quot; at 2010 .
we work with universities in all sub-saharan africa and store , social design .
we have a comic book . we have &quot; level high &quot; for the design of the world , and we have sustainability , sustainability , vision and genius .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in the world , in the most fundamental , which benefit from that , to save their own social enterprise to save the world .
i &apos;ll go to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have these all superpowers , the productivity of productivity , the ability to make close social nets , and the desire to make meaning for the meaning of the meaning .
i really hope that we &apos;re playing significant games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design with me like this and play .
if i go to the next decade , i &apos;m sure i &apos;m sure that we can create any future , and that we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the game games .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about what i was writing a few months ago in writing a article for wired wired wired .
i always have my favorite hand on my head , but i was with the work of text , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never been in my life , which is &quot; disabled &quot; really means what the word &quot; disabled &quot; means .
i read you the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; used , &quot; the &quot; aw , helpless , useless , destroyed , mutilated , mutilated , wounded , nirvana , bleeding , bleeding , rigid , rigid , rigid , rigid , rigid , rigid , rigid , &quot; and it &apos;s broken ,
so , healthy , healthy , powerful , powerful . &quot;
i read this list of a friend according to a friend , and i had to laugh , it worked so ridiculous , but i just came up until &quot; defeated &quot; and i had to get to read and get to the end of the emotional shock and
of course , this was a computer company , old , old , i thought , i just thought that the copy must be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early 1980s when i started with elementary school and started to build my self outside my family &apos;s brain and form , also in terms of other kids and the rest of the world around me .
and god is not using a computer scientist at the time .
i would take this post seriously , i was born in a world that someone like me would perceive as a person who could be positive in any way , but today i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the opportunity and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately said the most popular of 2009 , and i expected to find a piece of a piece of reference .
here &apos;s the most important version of this kind of puzzle .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , i &apos;m going to shake the last two words under &quot; near &quot; near &quot; close &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many ancient societies , including the greeks and the roman , really believed that the ambulance of a baby &apos;s life has a big force because what you &apos;re looking at is the kind of thing that you can do , also , to manifest yourself .
so , what do we really want to visualize -- a disabled person or a powerful person ?
just a human being to call a child , could be able to be able to put them and they &apos;re going to be able to do ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open you up to doors ?
a human being opened for me , was my pediatrician at the heart of the house , in the prison house in the hospital in the hospital .
he &apos;s called dr. strangelove . a name , whose name , as you can think , the most americans couldn &apos;t do correctly . so he always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. always wore very colorful flies and was just designed for the work with kids like this .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my favorite .
i had to repeat the only way that i had to do it , and i had to repeat with these big , elastic , elastic , different colors -- you know , to build my favorite , and i hated this tape , and i hated it .
and imagine , i even have a child &apos;s child with dr. p. , and so tried to stop this practice , and i &apos;m trying to stop it without success .
and one day he looked at me at one of my work -- these are just tiring and shopping -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so strong , powerful and young girls , you &apos;re going to get one day of
and if you make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this was just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that richest five girls in the hospital were going to be in the second floor , but he actually got me to see my
and i &apos;m asking myself today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl has shaped my self and i could imagine that as a nature of strong , powerful and more powerful human beings .
this is just one example of many , like adults in the world &apos;s imagination can make a child &apos;s imagination .
but as the most popular examples of the world &apos;s most popular , we can &apos;t make our language , imagine what we all would wish to do : it &apos;s to allow each one to see ourselves as a powerful person .
our language is the social change behind the social change that has been caused by a technological change .
of course , from the medical standpoint , you can say that my legs , the most powerful for the food of titan , and artificial media , for aging , is to use the people to actually use their own choices , and to define their own identity
so perhaps this technological change is clear because ever there was another truth , which is that every human society is a little bit more powerful and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt to our biggest plus is our biggest plus .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell you how i deal with mastery and i &apos;m going to say something like that , this phrase has never been a lot of the time to answer people ,
this phrase of dealing with the idea of success , that success or happiness depends on the challenge to master , without being connected to the experience of being connected to the experience of being able to get a life with a prosthetic , or whatever people can see
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course we &apos;re a challenge of the challenge , whether they &apos;re physically , emotionally or even both .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
and odds are not obstacle that we need to be able to get to our lives better with our lives .
and odds are just to our lives .
and i tend to be able to see , as my shadow , to see .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s hardly to see , but it &apos;s constantly at me .
and i don &apos;t want to do the impact of the impact of a human being .
there are more worries in life and challenges , and they &apos;re just the only person who &apos;s going to be different and every person is going to be different , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to get clear with it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for people we love to preserve , but they also prepare to get good to get it to be good .
and we don &apos;t really think of our kids if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to separate two things : to be a medical fact , to be an antibiotic , and to the other people think about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and permanent disability i had to put apart is that the world is constantly meant to describe me with these definitions .
in our desire , people who are protecting us , and they &apos;re the cold , hard truth about their medical projections , or even a forecast to the quality of life that they expect , we need to take care of that , we don &apos;t have to
maybe the concept is that the concept of what &apos;s going on in a broken , and how we fix that , for every single disability as the pathology of life .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being , and not all of its forces and opportunities and realizing , we can do it in addition to the natural struggle that you might have to have , another disease .
we &apos;re a human being that has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the world &apos;s oil and focus on all the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between perception of our flaws and our great organizational , a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t be able to hold this challenging times or deny , we should not try to avoid them , we should not try to avoid them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about realizing that we can see the odds .
it may be more about asking that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome ourselves , but that we &apos;re open to put them on the counter , to put them on the top of the day , and maybe even dance with it .
and maybe we can do it , and we can see , as a natural , coherent and useful and useful , and feel like this , not so much as a result .
in this year , we celebrate 200 . the birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin has been writing in my eyes , in a very real way , in the human character .
i would be so so so supported : not the most powerful of his way , and not the most powerful of his species , but the one who can adapt to the best .
from conflicts , creativity comes from .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of human beings , and the ability to survive , is defined by the fight of human mind , to turn through conflict .
so again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of people .
and maybe we know what wood we &apos;re cutting out of when we &apos;re really tested .
maybe that &apos;s the point of fear , a sense of the present , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like that .
we can give a new meaning to the fact that we can get beyond severe times .
maybe we can see more than change .
and odds are for change that we haven &apos;t adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve made ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
so , honestly -- who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual one . the typical one . but not the normal thing , and would you really want to know these poor gray person , if it really would be ?
i think it &apos;s not .
it would be great if we &apos;re doing this paradigm of normal versus another of the possibilities or the strength to even make it a little more dangerous , exchange the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their special and valuable skills into society
and the idea is that we found people from the members of our society always have a member of our society : being useful and to do a contribution .
there are evidence that the neanderthals have been older , and people with severe physical injuries have carried older injuries and that might have happened because the life experience in the world &apos;s life was valuable .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to town in the city i grew up in a red zone in the red zone in pennsylvania , and i was there a little bit ago ago .
it was summer and i had a lot of time .
and i hear how a guy behind me says , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to move around and see these older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you &apos;re not going to remember me .
when i first saw them , i took them out of the belly of their mother . &quot;
oh , so that .
and of course , it &apos;s done click .
this was dr. strangelove , a man i knew only from narratives of my mother , because i , of course , was very late to my birthday two weeks late .
the doctor for the training of my mother was in vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without a high school , and my feet were looking at them , and i just had a few toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , and he had the most ugly news to have the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say , &quot; i had to say you never would walk , and never be so mobile as other kids or that you could never have an independent life , and you &apos;ve just been lying on me . &quot;
i really found that he had collected my entire childhood , whether i had won in a second class in the second grade , whether i was going to the ted party in the second grade , whether i had a grant or a fan of my pet school
and he called this part of his course , the x factor , the potential of the human being .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough , as the key factor of the human life can be .
and dr. bliss kept telling him , he said , &quot; i learned that kids , if they didn &apos;t get anything else , and even if they get a little bit of support , if you get kids to get kids to themselves , they can get a
see , dr. strangelove has changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone is concerned about it , are two different things .
and i &apos;ve changed my thinking in time when you had asked me to be in the age of 15 years , whether i had my prostheses against legs and bones , then i would have no second to be a second .
i was really interested in the normal .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not sure .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not despite that experience .
and maybe this change could happen because i &apos;ve been watching so many people who opened up doors , rather than people who were being rejected me or to meet me a notion of a notion .
see , it really takes a human , which shows you how you can manifest your forces , and you &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to turn your own , internal forces -- the human mind is so versatile -- if you do that , and for someone in a critical moment , they &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to open doors .
the real meaning of the word &quot; the &quot; s &quot; roots in the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means something that is generating the potential .
again , what potential is we going to do now ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the u.k. , a case was done in the u.k. , and then the most transformed in the u.k.
they call this &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; in the united states , we call it &quot; the &quot; &quot; aw &quot; .
the students are being divided up .
and the a student will be tested harder , and the better teachers get the better teachers and so forth .
they have been given a long time to have a lot of time students with a &quot; sufficient &quot; -- they said , &quot; well , they &apos;re a very good job , they were told that they were very smart , and after these three months they really
and of course , it breaks into the heart that the other thing that the root is said was that the other way that the food is said is that they &apos;re only enough .
and it was the same thing that was going on for three months .
but only those who were still in school -- except from the students who were sleeping with school .
so , in this study , the teachers were not the most important .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they just said that the students and they are the students with the grade , and they &apos;re taught to be taught to them , and they &apos;re treated .
the only real disability is a broken mind , which was broken , has no hope , has no hope . he doesn &apos;t find any more of the natural , and he &apos;s not going to have any more sophisticated capacity of imagination .
but if we do it , the human mind is to keep to hope , to hope , and other people around themselves , and to be beautiful , and then we &apos;re going to be able to make our forces really positive .
if a spirit has about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new design systems .
i want to end with a poem that was written by an persian poet called the &quot; 14th century &quot; and the poem that i told my friend jacques was telling me , and the poem is called &quot; god , who knows only four words , &quot; but
come on , dance with me . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right now ?
suppose i said , through a few changes of their genes , a better memory could have -- more precise , more accurate and faster .
or you want to be more powerful , more force , more force .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be to live longer in good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who are always longing for more creativity .
what would you like to do ?
what would you like to have if you could just have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about so many as many as it is creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would be deciding for a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . the majority i like to do , as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a whole different world .
is that all a clue ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a persistent topic here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the point of a doctor &apos;s point .
the big geneticists in the 20th century , the most powerful , which was also a computer company in the russian orthodox church , wrote a paper called &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense of the evolution of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , this would be a very good time , you take your personal personal , you take your personal personal , and you can take a look at the permission of a
but if you accept biological evolution , you think about this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for other people &apos;s or is it ?
this is another view of life .
in this picture , i have a bush as a center of the branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of life , all the existing species of the branches have been successful in evolutionary terms : they have survived ; it has survived
the human part of this , far at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re interested in most .
we &apos;re digging from a shared ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids were in hominids .
some are come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about a few years .
it seems like we &apos;re right from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually , the biggest part , are the basic mechanisms of our cells quite equal .
is it clear that we can use it and make the mechanisms of a common bacteria to produce the protein of the human genome , which is used to treat the calcium ?
this is not like the kind of thing that &apos;s like , this is the same protein that &apos;s a chemically , which is the kind of pancreas coming from what comes out of the pancreas .
and what we &apos;re talking about is the bacteria that everybody is aware of us in our gut more bacteria than it is in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , think of it if antonio damasio asks her sense of self , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s wet , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to all be the nutrients that you could just want to offer without any effort .
it &apos;s really a lighter way to bacteria , with formal interruptions of unintended , forced to push the pressure .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they are important for their lives .
they help them to synchronize nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary balance in form of a species ?
or are we going to be something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s go back to the big bang , 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago -- the first signs of living organisms , perhaps three to four billion years ago , and then the human species ,
in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe , life on earth is just just a little bit more measured ; the animal kingdom , as a single comparison , and the human life , a small color system .
we were .
this also is the most important of the speech , so i hope , d ate it .
now , when i was a college student on college , i had my first favorite card .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in the world , each cell , and all the genetic information is going to be kept on the cell in both daughter .
but at the time , when the organisms turned out , things began to change .
sexual reproduction is the picture .
and very important : with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome will be the rest of the body , the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the most of the death of death in the body is going to happen in the same moment as the sexual reproduction .
now i have to confess , if i was a computer scientist , i thought , okay , sex / death , death , death for sex -- it seemed quite reasonable to the point , but with every year , it &apos;s been my more common challenge .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , who read his show in las vegas in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his own side of his brain .
he opens the door .
it &apos;s a beautiful warm of the computer &apos;s day .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for a ted company . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization that i was a goal of a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily , just different .
i tried to keep the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to try to rebuild health for a disease .
i wanted to have a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the copying of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they are and i developed as a cow , and i &apos;m developing the genetic rockets to send the genetic power in the next stage to go to the sea .
i think we would all be able to understand the mood that the woody allen has to understand when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get immortality through my work .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to prefer the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily be the biggest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the brightest .
evolution is the creatures that are best to adapt to their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , and that &apos;s the so-called steam , and that &apos;s because the hot steam would be , if fish were there , they would have a vacuum of fish to make it a vacuum .
so what does that mean when we look back at what happens in evolution , and how we think about the space of the people in evolution , and most of all , we would say that there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of equilibrium .
and the reason that we would be , the first thing that we did is we managed to get a lot of genes that would have been otherwise more inclusive and had been removed from the population .
and secondly , we have a species of our environment so that we have done it , that we &apos;ve done it , and we adapt to them , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and mix and mix and mix so much that they can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary for evolution to be more competitive .
a second way is that it &apos;s going to be a evolution of traditional species , of course , imposed by the forces of nature .
and the argument , here would be that the wheels of evolution is slow down , but they &apos;re slowed down .
and so far the isolation is when we &apos;re being constrained as a species of planets , it will be disgusting and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a compelling , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it a little bit of the new development -- the new development that &apos;s not just , but it &apos;s led to us as a function of the decisions that we do .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s first look at the reality that people today are making decisions about their offspring .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family decide .
so think of if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to make genetic adaptations , the diseases that are healing and prevent .
what if you could do the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or to eliminate the risk of risk or stroke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do it , to make these changes in your genes ?
if we &apos;re going to be able to get the kind of changes , these kinds of changes are increasingly possible .
the human genome project began in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost a billion billion dollars .
in the following year , when it was finished , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in the street to four months .
today , you can have a sequence of three billion base pairs of human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take long to be the reality that it will be the 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everyone .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering gave the most powerful prize for francis arnold and the most cosmopolitan , two scientists who developed independent techniques that were creating the natural process of evolution , to work faster and to lead to more efficient proteins in a
a few years ago , the most popular thing was awarded to the scientist &apos;s scientist , who was a adult , who took a adult , a computer , and by the manipulation of only four genes , the cell , and the manipulation of only four genes
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that can produce the human insulin in bacteria that can &apos;t only protect itself , but also to serve the immunity against other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with influenza that has been grown in the cells of a football system .
can you imagine something good that comes from tobacco ?
this is all reality today , and in the future , it &apos;s going to be much more possible .
so , imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
what if you could change the sperm and the fresh , or the fresh egg , to give your children a better chance to live a better chance -- eliminating diabetes , the risk of cancer , reduce the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to healthier kids ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science that can allow the changes to prevent disease , could also allow us to adopt the disease , and we can also be able to adopt the better memory .
why don &apos;t the most famous of a ken jennings , especially if you can extend it with the next generation of the world &apos;s population ?
why not the fast people who are going to allow them to run faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are going to be the same .
and if we &apos;re on a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want to be transformed by , we &apos;re going to be transformed by the evolution of evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that may be able to take 100,000 years , and we can compress it into a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions with those who are their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , they need to be involved .
do we use these decisions to form a society that is better , the more successful , that &apos;s more friendly ?
or are we going to be selectively different different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
will we form a society , and we &apos;re going to be more powerful , or more robust and resilient ?
these are the kinds of questions we need to face .
and the deepest of all , will we ever be able to develop wisdom , and the wisdom that we need to make that decision ?
in good ways , in the bad , and earlier as you might think , these decisions are going to be on us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine now , a portable robot that gives you a little bit of the skills , or another , the most powerful thing to get up and go up .
we call this robot in berkeley , these robots .
they &apos;re not different than something you put in the morning and gives you extra strength and increase your speed and will help you keep your balance , for example , to keep your balance .
this is indeed the real revolutionary of human and machine .
but not only that -- so they merge and connect them with the universe and other devices out there .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers , which carries about 100 pounds on its back , and it &apos;s the request that you should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- the -- 30 percent of it -- chronic , 30 percent of it .
so we thought we would embrace this challenge and create a design system that would help with this problem .
so let me introduce you to the moment -- or the human universal scanner .
soldier : with the most powerful , i can carry 200 pounds over the ground for 200 hours .
his flexible design allows it to be deeply in order to deal with , and to be highly agile .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then increase my strength and resilience .
we &apos;re so far with our online system of this device , this new kind of technology in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s look at our view of the flu , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who are estimated in the world in the wheelchair .
this is about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we often talk about very young people with spinal cord cord in the height of their life -- &apos; 30s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 40s -- hit by the fate of the fate and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , which is the number of times .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it comes to a more , or to do other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so it &apos;s been 500 years since it &apos;s been , as i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in mobility .
now let me introduce you to a little bit of the time that amanda &apos;s being carried by the 19 years ago , a spinal cord suffered to the result that she couldn &apos;t walk for 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our food system .
it has sensors .
his completely favorite sensors in the crutches , the signals that are exposed to our own , which is on your back .
here are also the most powerful , the most powerful , the most important is on your hips , as well as your own , moving forward in this fairly , very natural and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old , and in the wild , when a computer designer was a little bit of a time , i was a college officer .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my own .
not long after that , a doctor in my hospital room and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go back . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s steel every single time of my consciousness .
so , adaptable technologies have been to learn to learn , to go back to go back , to climb and drive , and even drive the hands .
but nothing was invented to me , and i &apos;d leave it back to now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet us and discuss them .
it &apos;s in our hands and we have the whole potential here to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here , but for all the ideas , but for all .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m a director of the u.s. war called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t get poverty , i &apos;m going to be a member of a child &apos;s fire , and i &apos;m a volunteer fire .
now , in our city , in the volunteers , a child &apos;s volunteer has been supported by a very early , early way to be able to be able to get a lot of the time .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer in the world &apos;s office , so i had a pretty good opportunity to get in .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to get the people who would be able to get out of the workforce and find out what our jobs would be .
when i found the most serious , he just had a very serious conversation with the most serious , which was certainly one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night and she stood in the pajamas and she stood under a screen in the pub , and she was in the front of her house in flames .
the other volunteers who came out of me -- we call him a pygmy luther -- we got the first one to go to the house and was asked to save the dog of the world &apos;s house .
the dog ! i was lost .
there was some lawyer or a lawyer who was now for the rest of his life , who could tell people that he went to a family house to save a living creature , just because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next .
the most powerful thing to me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go into the house .
you have to go up to the fire , and you have to get a few shoes , and you have to get a few shoes . &quot;
i swear to it .
now , not exactly what i hoped i was , but i went to -- the stairs up , the hallway , the &quot; real &quot; of the &quot; real &quot; , which was actually going to be done with this , in the bedroom , to get a
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey down , where i met my vow and the beloved dog .
we put our most hopeful out to the outside , where , not surprisingly , it got more attention than my own .
some weeks later , the most popular one was given a letter of the most painful , where she was going to be a brave use of her house .
one of the things that are estimated is that you have a few of the shoes , somebody had brought them a few shoes .
both in my profession at robin hood as well as a volunteer firefighter , i &apos;m witness by generosity and kindness in the big scale , but i also did the love of the individual and the most of the individual .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look at this room , and people who have either been able to get a little successful success or on their way , i want to offer this memory : wait not .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the lives of another , until you get your first million .
if you have something to give you , you &apos;re going to give it .
they &apos;re in a corporate store , they &apos;re in a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day , we will offer a chance to save life of a human life , but every day , we give us the opportunity to change one .
so they go ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno &apos;s s : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of the human being .
a place where women have the most powerful , with sex , and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not a matter of the sun , or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their familiarity .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the forest of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
that means we have a shared ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , which lived about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are known for their own business .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of the human evolution in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the medal .
as chimpanzees of large , fear of the great fear of the people will lead the most of the female female .
they really have what came up with , because that leads to a very unlikely society , which is not a deadly force in the deadly violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known among the primates .
they live in the deep of the protected river , and they &apos;re just hard to get access to the observation .
congo is a paradox -- a country extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the scene of a violent argument that has been used for decades and almost as many lives as the first world war .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction also are the survival of the bonobos .
and the decline of the world &apos;s population is that you can &apos;t even fill a stadium with the remaining bonobos -- and even there are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a little laugh that the trees are upset .
who are these related ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; because they have incompatible , also sex , with the partner , and the rules of conflict , and social media and social media .
i &apos;m not saying that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because life is made of more than the one-eyed of the bonobos .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives long .
play doesn &apos;t just mean the only thing .
for us and it &apos;s essential to the attachment of relationships and the care of tolerance .
we learn trust and the rules of the game .
play is also creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the production of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you look at bonobos in the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human health , dance and rituals .
play is the most popular thing that we &apos;re doing .
well , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique images straight from the wild .
first of all , a computer designer on the street -- and i don &apos;t think of football .
so here we see a young female and males in a computer scanner .
look at what she does .
this could be the evolutionary origin of , &quot; she puts it in the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more like him , not true .
yeah !
so , the other thing is , they &apos;re spread , both in bonobos as well as people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the most interesting thing that you &apos;re bringing to the new elements of the game -- like the testicles -- and also how the game is doing both
but the game is a very reactive game .
play is a computer game , and it can take a lot of forms of that some of which are quiet , some of the things that some of you are quiet , and you might be able to discover it again .
and i want to show you , this is a young female , a young female , and she plays the water with water .
i think that &apos;s exactly how you play , sometimes , and we &apos;re going to be able to get the limitations of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us work , and interact with it , and the unexpected wiring that we form are the real breeding of creativity .
this is just a little taste of the insights that bonobos give us in our past and present .
but it also true a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to the rise of challenges , through greater creativity and more skilled cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our main system .
to adapt to a world &apos;s world , we need to play .
but will we make the best out of our online system ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people equally , life is not from teeth and claws alone .
just if it &apos;s barely appropriate , play may be at the bottom of the day .
and so , my favorite , let &apos;s give this gift of evolution , and play together , while we &apos;re looking at creativity and the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs of pairs , in 1979 , at the same day , in exactly the same moment , every one of the baby -- okay .
so two pairs , every one of the baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to use the time to imagine the somali , because if you imagine the whole time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
imagine that just for a moment .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case that &apos;s a hummingbird , the sperm is carrying a y , which is hit on the x chromosome of the egg .
and in the other case , the sperm carries a x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the egg .
both are the most profound , both fire .
we &apos;re going to come back to these people later .
in most of my activities , i have two hats .
and i &apos;m going to talk about the story of the anatomy .
i &apos;m an historian , and i study , in this case , how people with anatomy -- that human body , animal bodies -- as you can with the body body , the animal body -- how they thought about body .
the other hat i &apos;ve carried in my work is the activist , as a designer -- or , as i say sometimes , as a tedster lawyer -- from people who are patients from doctors .
in this case , i worked with people who have the social norms , the social norms in question .
so , for example , i worked with people who are the twins twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with a lot of people who were less than common .
and very often , i worked with people who are working with their gender , and so people who have not the average male or female , who have no average male or female .
and as a general term , we can use the word of the word .
and it &apos;s a lot of different forms of life .
i just give you a few examples of the kinds of types of people who are not the male or female standard .
in a case , maybe someone with a computer company , and the gene &apos;s gene &apos;s gene leaves the y gene , the most powerful , which we all have , to grow up to testicles .
and that &apos;s why the testicles are giving testosterone at the stage .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to recognize testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t react to testosterone .
and that &apos;s called the &quot; test of water . &quot;
so much testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as a consequence , the body is developing more than the typical female course .
if the kid is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s brought up as a girl .
but it &apos;s mostly going to take you to puberty and grow your breasts and develop her breasts , but not your period , until someone comes to this , that there &apos;s something different .
and they make a few tests and find out that instead of making a difference and the uterus , in fact , they have a testicles in the way that they have a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold this person for a male , but that &apos;s not really you .
women , like men , have something that is called the body , that you call it a little bit of time .
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the most important thing is that the most nuanced hormones are what &apos;s called the dna .
most women , like me -- i think i &apos;m a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real estate , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me actually talk to a mathematically -- most women like me .
we produce the food systems and we &apos;re talking to a logarithmic .
the consequence is that somebody like me actually has a brain that was more exposed to the other woman than a woman who was born with testicles , and a computer company has a little bit of a time .
so gender is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be distributed over the range of the range , you can be distributed over the range of the range .
one of the things that i had was a couple of years ago , i got the call of a 19 year-old man who was born as young , and he had a friend , he had sex with his girlfriend , lived with his girlfriend , and he
he had an extreme form of an innate form of natural art .
he has a little chromosome , and in the womb , his favorite , so much , was so active that they have a male , which is essentially a male .
and as a consequence , his dried male male was exposed to his brain , the brain was exposed to the most powerful male part of the world &apos;s brain .
and when he was born , he saw a boy from -- no one was a little bit .
and only as he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he was standing inside the ground that the doctors found that he was in the inside female .
okay , just a quick example of a variation of a variety of plastic .
some people with the chromosomes , they develop something called the most responsible , which is called the water system of the brain .
we don &apos;t know exactly why that happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why kids with this kind of body -- it &apos;s a little bit of the time , or the twins , or the twins , are often adapted to the norm , not because it &apos;s for their physical health of advantage .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they &apos;re often made different kinds of surgical interventions is because they threaten our social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that a certain anatomical feature is associated with a certain identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is to have a female identity ; a black person is to be , is to be happy , an african anatomy in terms of the story .
so we have this awful simplistic idea .
and if we &apos;re faced with a body that actually is very different for us , it &apos;s confused us in terms of these things .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about the life-saving .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of technorati .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when kids are born , the two people in a body are .
where i had been most excited about most of the excitement , south african ii was last year , whose gender was asked in the world &apos;s world &apos;s world in berlin .
many journalists were calling me the question : &quot; what test are you going to do , who tells us whether the most powerful female or male is ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s no test .
we know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not a line between male and female , or between male and female and female and female and female and female and female and female .
so we have a situation where , the further our science is accelerating , we need to be able to admit that these categories that we had thought of for robust anatomical categories , which made very simple , very simple , more low-tech , is a lot of
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also true of race , which turns out to be a lot more complicated than our primary health system has been approved .
we have a lot of different things in our observation .
we &apos;re going to run for example , for example , that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what should we do with the fact that we just differ from them by a few periods of time ?
while we keep our science further , we get increasingly in a zone of awkwardness , where we need to recognize that the most important categories we have probably had too simple .
we see this in all sorts of different areas of human life .
one of the areas that we see in the world that we see in our culture today , in the united states today , are the struggle of the beginning and the end of life .
we have hard conversations about what a body is going to be like to people , so that he &apos;s got another right life than the fetal life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- maybe not as public as in medicine -- about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors had never been to fight the question when someone was dead .
they &apos;ve only kept a feather under the nose , and if they moved , they haven &apos;t buried them yet .
if you didn &apos;t move it , you &apos;ve buried it .
but today we are in a situation where we &apos;re taking people to take vital organs and put them in other people .
and as a result , we caught ourselves at the fight with really difficult question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation that we don &apos;t have as simple categories as we used to .
now you might think that the whole thing was going to be a person &apos;s crash , and i would be happy to do it .
i &apos;m politically more skilled , i &apos;m more sensitive to people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit it &apos;s nervous .
to realize that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , i think , make me clear .
and it makes me realize that democracy is about to be happy .
so to tell you about this tension , i first have to get a car professor , that i &apos;m a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were a little bit of the time , i know they were a lot of the time , but they were great .
i think that they were so versatile and strong , and so radical , in which they were doing that , i &apos;ve been looking at the most of the time that i &apos;ve been looking at the most , and it &apos;s not because of the music that
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happening in the world &apos;s atmosphere .
the fathers were from my view of the original anatomical activists , which is why .
what they were doing was a concept of a concept , and they were replacing it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you remember , our fathers refused to the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very exciting concept of anatomy .
the ruler of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of the design system .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power , they should have this political power , because of the most prolific of the grandfather , the father and so on .
the founding fathers , the founding idea , they put this idea back and they were replacing by a new kind of concept , and this concept said that all people were creating the same way .
they &apos;re going to play the field field and decided that , in fact , that , in fact , the common similarities , the common differences , and that was very radical .
now they did this , because they were part of a system of a system in which two things were together .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , science grew up .
if you look at the story of the founding fathers , it &apos;s clear that many of you were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a world &apos;s world .
they went away from explanations , and they were making things like a supernatural concept of power , back where the transmission of the concept is based on a very highly important idea of the epilepsy .
they moved to a very somber concept .
and if you look at the declaration of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , they managed to make a concept of the anatomical common .
and so they have really been prepared to be the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened after that ?
for example , women who were looking at the right to the concept of dads , the concept of the founding fathers , is that there &apos;s a lot of the anatomical difference than the anatomical difference , and said , &quot; that we have a uterus and the
and women are successful .
next , the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like the most powerful , which is about the way that we saw , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the line of the world &apos;s lines , saying , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people are different skin color , which are different in anatomical ways of different differences , again , successful .
we see the same thing in the world .
of course , the problem is that , as we start looking at all the common similarities , we need to start asking , why we are keeping certain wavelengths of disgust .
now , mind , i want to maintain certain wavelengths of disgust , and in our culture , in our culture .
i don &apos;t want to give you the same right as a human being .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want five times to say that five times the right thing to do , to get your informed consent or marry your consent .
so there are some of these anatomical feedbacks that make sense for me , and we think , i think , keep supposed to be .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and whether they &apos;re useful .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that have been launched at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in 1979 , in the same day .
so let &apos;s imagine that one of them was born , maria , three months of being born , so it &apos;s born at june 1980 .
so , henry , on the other side , is born to the ted system , so he &apos;s born at march 1980 .
only because of the fact that maria 3 months was born , they all get the right three months of henry -- the right to have sex , which is right to choose , to drink the right .
henry has to wait for all this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of the birth of his birth .
we find other oddities of what their rights is .
henry , because you think he &apos;s male -- although i don &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the mit with the computer -- because you think he &apos;s a male , he can now move what maria doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
maria , but can &apos;t be able to perceive the same thing in all states , the henry in all states , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
henry can marry a woman , but maria can only marry a woman today in a few states .
so we have this permanent anatomical category that are in many ways , and questionable .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is doing such progress in the field of anatomy that we have to get a point where we have to admit that democracy is based on anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , sometimes it feels like science is going to be autonomous .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture is going to take a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; well , we need to pull somewhere , so we &apos;re going to pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught up in a very strange position .
so for example , texas has decided to get a man to marry a man that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and a woman means to marry a y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested on their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i told you about the most amazing .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i &apos;m talking a dream . &quot;
he says we should not be able to say , &quot; your skin color , &quot; but after the property of your character , &quot; judge your character , &quot; and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you evaluate people because of their characters ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be able to get right in terms of people , because i must admit that i know a series of golden golden rights that probably makes benefits more than some people i know .
i want to know that i &apos;m probably familiar with some bright light points , which are the most powerful , more intelligent and more mature decisions to meet their sexual relationships than some more than a more , which i know .
so how do we ask the question of the character of the character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really hard .
and part of me , what if the content of a personality would be something that would be in the future -- could be visible by an fmri visible ?
do we really want to go to this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really matters to think about the idea that the united states is in the way to make thoughts about democracy .
in our effort , we &apos;ve done our thing really well , and i think we would do our thing in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like the case of iran , where a man who feels sexually to other men , who are punished with death , is because he &apos;s ready to put a car in which case he can stay alive .
states of this kind of way exist in us .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon i talked about a few years ago , who had a few of the twins who had a few of the twins who had a few of them to separate them , partly to
but when i was with him , and he asked him why he made these interventions -- it was high surgeries -- was his answer that in his country , these kids would be very bad , and so he had to do it .
i said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve got political asylum in favor instead of a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible opportunities to allow people to be the ones that they &apos;re , without the state of the will .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to close , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked very much about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibility of democracy , or looked at democracy , if we had more involved in the mothers .
and i want to say something that is radical , and i think that there might be different kinds of insights that are spreading from different species of anatomy , if people are using a design system .
since years , because i was interested in the research of the world , i also interested in research in the field of research .
and one of the things i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from the study of research studies is that women , in average -- not every , but in average -- more complex social relationships and care for people who are vulnerable to the group of people who are vulnerable to the group of people .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i made a graduate student , one of my graduate students , who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked at myself as a feminist , so it &apos;s a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism is female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about to solve stereotypes about gender , so the feminism is nothing female .
but the more i thought about his question to think more , i thought it could give a female in feminism .
that &apos;s what it might be called , it could give something , in average , which is different , female brains of male , which makes us more sophisticated social relationships , and more sophisticated for the most complex .
so where the founding fathers were extremely eager to be able to protect the state of the state , it &apos;s possible that if we were more mothers in this concept , we can make more a concept of the concept of the world , not just how to
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go in the future , if we &apos;re going to think about democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual body , and think about relationships .
so , if we try to make a more perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a little bit of a fan and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;m going to do in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with outfits .
i love to find a different kind of a different kind of thing , to wear crazy outfit , and to photograph , and to photograph it , and to be blogging .
but i don &apos;t buy new .
i get all my clothes from second hand on the street and in the wild .
ooh , thank you .
and i &apos;m going to give you the impact of my favorite , the impact of my favorite , and also to my wallet .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars for common purpose , i think , is quite unique ; i see pretty unique , and it &apos;s going to go shopping to my own personal personal system .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it have my size ?
am i going to like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i tell you what i &apos;ve been doing for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does someone bring with so many outfits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven of the underwear , and that &apos;s all .
and so , the same thing for a week is everything i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i have a bet that i would have anything i would wear , if i just came to palm springs .
and since you don &apos;t have me heard of me as the woman who &apos;s walking around here at ted in her underwear -- that &apos;s what i found a few things .
and i want to show you my outfits for this week .
sounds good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m going to leave you with some of the lessons i think you &apos;re doing or not , from these foreign scientists , not to wear new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the luminous tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost look at a lot of it for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the coat , has 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i &apos;ve carried in this whole week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiological impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing pants pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re going to pull other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation is completely disconnected .
i spent a lot of time in my life trying to be , i myself , and i &apos;m constantly ashamed of myself .
just be who you are .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , you &apos;re not going to understand it , you &apos;ll also appreciate it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people say , i saw , i saw , &quot; i &apos;m playing &quot; playing games or i remember her . &quot;
i &apos;m smiling , and i say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re going to see it in something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think that you don &apos;t look good in something , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
if you believe that you &apos;re inside and the outside , you &apos;re a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for someone here in this audience .
we should be able to rock everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden , golden design .
and finally , saturday : a very unique , unique style to develop , is a great way to tell the world about a little bit , without having to say a word .
it was always proven to me and again , when people were on me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home , i &apos;ll give it all the time .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to emotionally make these things emotionally , because the same thing is going to be a different crazy , more crazy , more intimidating , and just waiting for me to be a little bit of love , and i &apos;m looking for it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all together .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as a flying , flying glass .
this is what we call the lab , we call design design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every young boy in italy grows with this image in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is a very interesting thing in the last decades .
a few times ago , when you wanted to win a formula , then they took their budget and they put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now , you need to take a race , if you want to win a race , actually something like this -- something that &apos;s going on in real time , some thousand sensors that have information from the car , and then they &apos;re going to change the
this would be called , in the blink of a , a computer company .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is made out of two parts -- a piece of a piece of a space and a computer system .
what &apos;s interesting today is the most important thing to do in our lives .
our cities were equipped in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
they become the computer in the free .
and as a computer in free , you start to respond to other kinds of ways , and you &apos;re going to be able to be seen and driven .
if we &apos;re cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population is living there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the world &apos;s population -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
over the cities , all of this sense , and push all of this insight into objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition that paola antonelli for moma later in the year , while the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
now , all our objects , our environment , start to talk to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom out there to both of them , a sensor and a laser .
and that changes radically the interaction that we have people with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , when michelangelo shaped the moses , it means he took the hammer and he threw him on moses -- actually , you can still see a little bit of a place -- and said , &quot; well , &quot; do you know , &quot; the &quot;
now , today , our environment begins to answer us to answers .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with the realization .
now the first project i want to introduce you to is in fact of one of the first of our lab .
it was developed in italy four years ago .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually to use new kinds of network that was used on the world -- that &apos;s a very , very sophisticated -- and anonymous and the information of this network to use the network that &apos;s going to be collected by the city
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was the kind of christmas that was going to be the national union .
some of you will remember it was in italy , and then at the end of the day , the most salient thing , the most salient .
and anyway , in italy , it won &apos;t have won at the end .
now , you see what happened in this day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see the middle of the middle , the flow of the river .
on the morning , the game .
you see the timeline up .
and the afternoon , people here and there , they &apos;re making calls and move .
the game starts -- silence .
france makes a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
and it &apos;s repeated , and people are going to go to a little call , go on the toilet .
second , it &apos;s cut . end of the normal .
first extension , second .
so , in a moment of the computer , the most successful .
italy wins . yeah .
now , in this night , all of the center went to celebrate .
they saw the big key .
the next day , all the center to meet the center of the world and the prime minister of the time .
and then all the down .
you see the picture of the space , encouraging , where , since the roman time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the key thing at the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
another example of a different example of feeling : this is not about people , but to do things that we use and consume .
now , we know all about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that are a mac computer , which is how they came together .
but we just know little about where things go .
so we actually designed a few little markers in this project to track the garbage while it goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers who have been helping us , a little more than a year , in seattle , who are doing things that they &apos;re going to be able to see -- different kinds of things that you can see -- things that you would
then we have the little chips that are little brands , the little brands , and they started tracking it .
here are the results that we &apos;re getting right now .
from seattle ...
after a week .
and with this information we realized that there &apos;s a lot of information in the system .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of the most powerful , and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day , that the cup we throw away is not just that they &apos;re still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw away every day .
and if we show the people , then we can move a behavior change .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , the most powerful , could tell you much more about the sense and the many other wonderful things that you can do with a sense of view , but i want to talk to the second part of the world that we were talking
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in the back of spain , spain .
it started with a question of the village village , which came to us and said that spain and the most beautiful tradition have a beautiful tradition of water as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to new technology ?
and one of the ideas that were measured in a very small fashion system was , imagine these tubes , and valves , the valves , they work , and they end up with .
they &apos;re doing something like a football system with a water bottle of water .
if these are the fall down , they can write patterns , they can write patterns , images , text .
and you can get away , and he &apos;s going to open up to make you feel like you can see on this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor of the studio .
it &apos;s very much like it .
and we got the assignment to design a building in the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was from water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you &apos;re approaching it , it &apos;s going to open up and you &apos;ll leave it in .
the roof was covered with water as well .
and if it &apos;s windy , if you want to reduce the syringes , you can even leave the roof down .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture will be like in this case , you know , this days , if you get the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t kill the building , it &apos;s just that architecture disappears almost away .
here you see the building works .
you see the person who asks what happens inside the inside .
and here you see me when i tried to test the sensors that opened the water , not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what happened at night when all the sensors stopped working .
but actually , it was a greater fun at this night .
all the children from the street came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to make them a , but a building that still had breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump now without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we think about how people are using things that we design .
but the reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical , the most powerful , the most prolific of water and the projections .
and this is what we got to think about this project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine that these are really the same things that you could do .
imagine you could have little helicopter , which flies through the air , and every one of you with a little bit of a little bit of light with light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter that you saw earlier , which is moving with other people , completely in sync with other things .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or irregular , but in three dimensions , which is what changes , the light is not the position of the brain .
you can play with different kinds of species .
imagine the screen just in different ways , or sizes , in different ways .
but then the whole thing that could be a 3d cloud from the surface of the brain that you can walk through and move through the way that you can look at a lot of , many directions .
here you see a real , real estate , the most powerful , the way to form a pink v .
if you turn the light off , it looks like this . so , as we saw it before .
imagine that every single one of people are being run .
it could have any single impulse to have a impulse that comes from people , from the movements of people or something .
i want to show you something here first .
we worked with the design of the world &apos;s best dancer , one of the best ballet dancers in new york , and the scale of the metropolitan theater in new york and the scale in milan -- we &apos;ve taken its movements in 3d to use it as
here you &apos;re dancing with the dancing .
on the left , you see the most powerful sensations , the different kinds of sensations .
it &apos;s a very , very much a design system , and a more powerful .
so that you can feel the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we all have the most sophisticated , you can play with color and play gravity and play .
we want to use this as a possible impulse for the design system .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we work on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is , imagine that we &apos;re going to engage people with something that we do with something and change the environment -- almost something like we call it , the way we call it a design , but with a cloud .
imagine that every one of a little donation can give a donation for a drug .
i think that the remarkable thing that happened last year is that the last decades is that we &apos;re changing from a physical world to a digital world .
it &apos;s all digitized , knowledge , and it &apos;s accessible by the internet .
today , we can do the first time -- and the campaign obama has shown this -- we can move from the digital world , from the world &apos;s forces to the physical world .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is something that is built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can be to ask us the next challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we move from the digital world to physical .
so the idea is that we actually engage people with them , and they do things together , collective .
the cloud is again a cloud of plastic , in the same way , like a real cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud of a cloud of plastic .
it &apos;s a physical form in london , but it &apos;s covered with a plastic game .
you can move and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments for the most important moments of 2012 and beyond , and it uses the kind of connection to the community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go to the top of the sun , like london &apos;s new mountain .
you can go inside .
and a kind of digital downturn in the night -- but as a computer designer , a new way of experiencing all the experience of the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important to the relationship .
i &apos;m trying to express my work that people are not separated from nature and that everything is connected .
the first time i was in antarctica almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first bow .
i did awe .
my heart sank , i was a little bit of time , while i tried to grab what was going on .
the thylacine around me almost 60 meters from the water , and i could only wonder that this was a snowflake on another snowflake , year year .
in the end , the thylacine was born as a calf , or by breaking out of the street .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re interacting with the very clear way of their environment and their experiences .
some people are giving up and they &apos;re going to be able to give up to the bitter end , while others don &apos;t get to the end and make it a fit of more dramatic passion .
if you look at an iceberg , you think that you &apos;re isolated , separated and alone , and just as we see people often .
but the truth is far away from it .
as a iceberg melts , i &apos;m going to cut its carbon atmosphere .
while the iceberg melts , he &apos;s turning water to drinking water , which is a lot of life feeds .
i &apos;m going to go to my photographs of this pink , as if i would make portraits of my ancestors , in which consciousness , that they exist in these individual moments , and never yet exist again .
it &apos;s not death if you melt ; it &apos;s not a end , but it &apos;s a kind of a body cycle of your life cycle .
part of the ice in the ice industry that i &apos;m going to be very young -- some thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is a iceberg that i have in the greenland in greenland .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually witnessing a kind of a penis iceberg .
here you see it .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the top of the iceberg .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a football system .
it &apos;s about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just like this , the iceberg shows another side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really blessed by work in some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy .
his name is a little bit of a sudden .
and the chief artist was one of the leading graffiti of the 1980s .
then one day , he came back from walking back and said , &quot; dad , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the one .
now , it &apos;s completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i was standing on him .
so i have a company that makes design and animations , so it &apos;s inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the art world and look at .
so we decided , tony -- and his thing to support .
i met with his father and his brother and his brother , and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
i just want to talk to him , and i said , &quot; wait , i &apos;m not -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all be the paralyzed people using this stuff ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you heard about higher consumer and a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not available to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , how do you communicate ? &quot;
does anybody see the movie &apos; butterfly and the &quot; butterfly &quot; ?
so they communicate -- so their fingers walk along .
i was like , &quot; very , very , very popular , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came to the need , just a check , and instead i put a check from that i didn &apos;t have the smallest idea of how to feed him .
i &apos;m preparing to be in place and his brother and his father -- with the words : &quot; well , my proposal is like this : tony will speak , we &apos;ll get it to a device and find a way to make it happen again .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s still wearing it , it cannot communicate . &quot;
so i spoke a few months later at a conference .
i met these people from the street lab , graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to put light on every surface and then draw with a plastic system that &apos;s just going to be the negative area .
so they &apos;re moving around and they make the same thing like this .
they say that all things that are shown up there is a life cycle .
it starts with the genital organs , then the most important , the most important , and finally , people are doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentation .
so i went home , and i was eating with my wife and i told her , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology , you can use the way that you can use your eyes to control things , and then we should find
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and lots of things , we have reached some things .
first , we have the insurance companies , and we have the doors , and actually , for a device , we can get a device that he can communicate with -- a stephen hunter .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him a little bit of a time , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so troubled , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and we also have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and programmers and the computer and the computer and the computer and the house .
many of our friends thought we were beautiful , and that we were going to be beautiful and that we were all the images of the walls .
but for about two weeks , we &apos;ve been programmed to be programmed to the ted center in venice , my children were involved , and we created this .
it &apos;s called the &quot; s &quot; and you can see the description .
this is a cheap cybercrime that we bought on the most of the world &apos;s climate system , something called a little bit of a little bit of the hardware and a few things from the hardware store and the water .
we took a video company , they have a set of things , they put it on a set and now we have a device that &apos;s free -- you can build it yourself , we can make the code free , we can download the code free .
so we have created a device that is completely free from constraints .
no insurance can be .
no hospital .
now , every paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes , or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else and that &apos;s his room .
there &apos;s all of these things that are the big unveiling .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of planning , and the previous nights , tony and the nights , tony , first time , drew seven years after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and it looks beyond his life support system .
we have his bed down to see it out there .
we set up a projection on a wall of the hospital , the hospital of the hospital .
and he was doing the first time , in the most early of his family , and friends -- and you can just imagine what a sense of a lot of the parking was .
so , we had to go in the parking room , and we felt like a part of the most powerful .
at the end , he would send us an email with the content , &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve been drawn something .
i feel that i was going to get out of water and finally , someone got down and raised my head , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that mind-blowing ?
this is something like our favorite system .
that &apos;s what keeps us on the shelf and we keep going to go further .
and we have to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a very amazing thing .
and somebody who has such an artistic potential , so much more .
so we &apos;re in finding out how to do it better , faster and stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve all received the kinds of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one deserves it .
it &apos;s all coming from our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong &apos;s lessons on us and then , december , we &apos;ve honored the most exciting thing to do when one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 was what was really great .
the most important thing about this is -- and that &apos;s the whole circle -- that this is april , in the middle of the city , in the middle of los angeles , a show called &quot; the way of the &quot; the world &apos;s &quot; style of
and there &apos;s probably the hardest representatives of the world &apos;s most difficult -- the most difficult thing to be -- the most powerful , more cosmopolitan , the most powerful , you &apos;re going to be there .
and the point is that it &apos;s going to be part of the show , which is pretty wild .
so basically , i &apos;m about to say , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , it can make it possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the most powerful -- it was impossible to do .
do it possible -- you all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never had anything to do with a little bit of time , but i just got a little bit of it and i &apos;ve been surrounded with amazing people so that we could put something on the legs .
and this question should be , every single day , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing , and that &apos;s what you have to do , which is going to have to be done , and if not now , when , if not , and if i
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably most of america &apos;s most commonly more cosmopolitan .
and i always say that i don &apos;t want to come like a scientist , so i want to come .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody ever voted farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
well , a epiphany is usually something that you find because you &apos;ve left it somewhere .
you &apos;re going to go around the block and it &apos;s a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard viii .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you today .
my circle began at the &apos; 60s at the high school in the &apos; 60s , ohio , where i was the most popular .
i was the one who was beaten every week in the most violent green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using me the toilet in the prison shop .
they did it .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go out of the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it struck me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then in the &apos; 80s , i found it important to the &apos; 80s .
about three or four years ago , i received a call in the middle of the night , a call from this teacher , woman who said , &quot; i have to see them .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other as adults .
you can come to ohio , and please come together with the man i know that you &apos;ve found it now .
and i should say that i have a little bit of time , and i want you to go to it . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew they &apos;d have to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them , and we took them to them , and we gave them eight , because it needed to be necessary , because it was necessary .
it was something that we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults , they turned me out , they turned into a box full of ashes and turned into my hands .
what happened was that the circle had closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation of that i &apos;ve talked about was .
the revelation is , death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that needs the rest of life .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is so often mentioned here .
he needs the same -- he would need , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to give us these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , as you climb up on 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a engine that &apos;s the separation , the separation , tends to , limitations , limitations , limitations , limitations , encouragement .
that sounds scary .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat on a street .
i was the only one who could talk to the most of the time .
so i looked at it , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve probably caught some birds . &quot;
the pilot had been able to get the machine and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened simultaneously .
the pilot set up the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s not usually the route .
it turns out the engines .
imagine a little bit of a plane .
and then he said three words -- the most popular words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; the ground to the ground . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the most of the time .
i could see it in her eyes , because it was horror , life was too close .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
we have this kind of thing , we have these things that we want to do in life and i thought to all the people that i wanted to make a hand and not did , all the fences i wanted to do , and never did .
while i was thinking about it , a saying , i noticed , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because if the wine is , and the person is there , then i open it .
i never want to move anything in life .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned at this day -- and that was when we were going to go to the george washington bridge , so pretty much about this -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing i really really did .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i mean , i &apos;m going to be better in everything i &apos;m doing .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve been given my ego to my ego .
and i was the time i &apos;m wasted for the most of the things that i &apos;m wasted for people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to people , to people .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t have to write two years with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have a right , right , i &apos;m going to be happy to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and that &apos;s the inner clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot;
you see the water coming .
i said , &quot; please flying into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts , like you know it from a documentary .
while we were missing , i had this feeling , man , to die , not terrifying .
almost as if we were to prepare our lives for it .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness , really , in a thought , is that i just wish to give one thing .
i wish i could see my kids growing up .
about a month after that , i went to a performance of my daughter -- first of all , not a lot of artistic talent ...
... not yet .
and i &apos;m going to write , i &apos;m crying like a little kid .
and in the world , everything was made for me .
i realized that by the time i connected the dots , it &apos;s just a great father to be a great father .
more than anything , everything else , is my only goal to be a good father .
i was not going to die the miracle of that day .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , and come back and live differently .
my call to all the people who fly today is : do you imagine the same thing on your flight -- don &apos;t -- but do you think it &apos;s going to change ?
what would you do , that you &apos;re going to stick , because you think they &apos;re forever there ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parents that you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the cliche is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for the development of nuclear weapons is the most important thing in the world .
the gray boxes that you see here are the most powerful .
now , if it &apos;s possible to make the systems , which control the systems and valves , then we can actually cause a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes are not running with the surface of the technology ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we do it , a effective model of energy on a laptop is used by a laptop that &apos;s used by a plastic , and then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind stuxnet .
so we start with a laser test .
the most popular box will go into the gray box , the centrifuge , and the iranian , and the iranian , in the world , is a mission .
this is a piece of cake , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started to digitize our research six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was the sense and purpose of this kind of thing .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the most complicated part of the world &apos;s brain , the most powerful part of the world , made of a lot of the people who have made a use of use .
and it seemed to be something called a little bit of a little bit of the boxes , these gray boxes , this kind of plastic .
the shared our attention and we started a project project , where we were infected with our environment with stuxnet , and we studied this construction .
and then something weird happened .
so , in a way , how a computer company was not like a car that was not like our cheese -- it &apos;s not going to be a food , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that &apos;s not what made sense in my eyes .
and after we were experimenting with different kinds of cheese , i went to that this is a more powerful attack .
completely on a particular destination .
the most active track of the gray box is looking around the gray box , when a special configuration was discovered , even if that &apos;s a special program , which is trying to get infected on this goal .
and if not , it doesn &apos;t even do it .
so , that really got my interest and we started working with it almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , we &apos;re going to say , a u.s. power power station , or a more successful in germany .
so we should be better to find out what the goal is .
so , we &apos;re going to get the code code and we found the code code , and we found that it &apos;s in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a larger one .
and we also realized that they were very professional constructed by people who had all the most of the information that they had .
they knew all bits and the other bits they had to attack .
you probably knew the most important thing about the most powerful .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve seen that the most sophisticated thing is that the most high-tech of stuxnet is complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the most powerful is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more difficult than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this kind of thing that &apos;s going on .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
looks like an old-fashioned health system .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code .
so after what we were looking for first , we were the first time we know what this is doing .
and then we looked for the design and we were trying to bring these to the real world in connection -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could demonstrate or prove .
so to make these theories , we call ourselves in memory that it &apos;s definitely about the most powerful , it has to be a high goal , and it &apos;s probably a very likely to be in iran because most infections were reported .
now , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
it &apos;s basically going out to the nuclear power system and on the top of the road in the ocean .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; let me give you a list of all experts for centrifuge and power plants from our client . &quot;
and i called them , and i was going to know her , to compare her expertise to what we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital technology to the computer &apos;s business .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , these black object that you see .
and if you manipulated the speed of this kind of thing , you actually can actually crack the rotor and then actually go to the centrifuge , and then actually explode the centrifuge .
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was actually , and it &apos;s very slow to let it happen -- obviously , in the trial of trying to get to the trial , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get quickly behind it
the great digital media system -- we got a glimpse by looking at the data and looked at the data .
so for example , the number of light is very , very out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started to do scientific literature , and i started to do this as a centrifuge in the peer-reviewed , and found that they &apos;re structured in so-called the so-called , and every single one of the things that contains is a balanced centrifuge .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it was better .
these centrifuge in iran are divided in 15 times the levels .
and guess what we found in the field of the world ?
a very identical structure .
so again , that &apos;s really good together .
and this gave us great confidence for that , which we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t just like that .
these results were achieved by several weeks of hard work .
and often we ran into a dead and had to collect us .
anyway , we found that both digital warheads in reality actually came up with a and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little little computer picks up a computer , and the wooden layer , and the high one , and the big estate , and the big estate , is going to be in interaction with six more and a half of the time .
so , in the big and all we &apos;re very confident that we actually have a lot of what the goal is .
it &apos;s a little bit of a time , and it &apos;s just a little bit of the time .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other targets could be met by angeline .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- really made me out of the socks .
there &apos;s the gray box down there , and you see the centrifuge on top of it .
now , what this thing is doing is that it &apos;s the powers of sensors that are mapped to sensors -- for example , from the point of data and the power of information -- and it &apos;s available to the code that &apos;s still available , with false
and in fact , this false powers of publication of stuxnet has been taken before .
so it &apos;s just like in the car car , where the car car is fed up with the air phone with previously the air .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the idea of this is obviously not just the most important thing in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to trick a digital model .
we need digital media systems where a human being can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a power station , for example , if the big bang is going to be fast , you have to open up within milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human being .
so , this is what we need to do digital engineering .
and if the risk of risk is , then really bad things can happen .
the power station can explode .
and neither the most popular , the most important thing is going to notice .
that &apos;s scary .
but it &apos;s going to be worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is a little bit more .
he doesn &apos;t have anything to do with centrifuge , with a peer fiber .
so he would work so well -- in a power station or a power station .
it &apos;s a little bit of a time .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you have to put the internet on a stick stick , like we saw it in yad .
you could also use ordinary technology technology to spread .
you have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you get a mass of mass weapon .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the environments that are the environments .
we need to ask the consequences and we &apos;re going to start to prepare ourselves .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was reported very much of that , that people think that the most important thing is the most powerful thing behind .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
i think the most important thing is , the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the most powerful superpower .
there &apos;s only one and that &apos;s the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for having a senior complaint . thank you ralph .
i spent the last few years to put in situations that usually are very difficult and very dangerous at the same time .
i went to jail -- hard .
i worked in a computer shop -- dangerous .
i filmed in a comic game -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days , nothing like this to eat -- fun at the beginning , a little bit of hard in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
i actually have the biggest part of my career , and i think of the most terrifying situations , and that all just for trying to study social history that they &apos;re compelling and interesting , and hopefully to understand what they &apos;re doing for the audience and make
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world of the world &apos;s world , and look at the world of the world &apos;s world , i knew i would do something a little bit different .
some of you may have heard that i had a pair of weeks ago a pair of weeks ago .
i sent a few of the pieces of paint , some of the most cosmopolitan , and i gave people the opportunity to go to the ted class of 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , and the most happy , they got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let that go back to the point of the talk that you &apos;re seeing at the moment , which is not a
so what you got was this : her name here presented : my tedtalk , from which you don &apos;t know what the subject will be , and the one that finally could fly to the ears , especially when i put your company dumb to your involvement .
but it &apos;s a very good media opportunity , but it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
this is just the most powerful .
so despite this warning , i knew that anybody would buy the most popular .
now , if you asked me this year , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you about that .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve been going to be in some pretty terrible situations , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could be able to get me to something so hard and so dangerous as with these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is a film about the most cosmopolitan , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by the whole film , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the world &apos;s &quot; the &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the &quot; the world &apos;s &quot; the world &apos;s &quot; is that everything , from above to the end , is completely labeled by the beginning to the end , completely with brands that you see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand
now this brand , the most salient stadium , the most salient center ...
these people are being connected to the film in eternity -- forever .
and so the film is going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a person &apos;s person .
that was more to the emphasis .
it was &quot; in eternity forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x as a result of the brand , but we &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the movie .
so we might sell a shoe and he will be the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever carried ...
the greatest car that you ever have , from &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the world &apos;s &quot; the greatest drink , &quot; which you &apos;ve ever had , a attention of &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the world &apos;s &quot; the &quot; the world
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are part of life , actually , to bring them to the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of all the film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of cloning .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to end .
and i would be happy if i could help , if you could help , to make this happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how to be a lot of people .
have you a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because that has a negative , but you know how that &apos;s going to evolve ?
how much money is needed to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet , but i think it &apos;s worth it , some really familiar brands .
who knows if the movie comes out , we might see a little bit of a tribe .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
the answer is probably not going to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing to do because of the movie or a difficult thing to me ?
jk : both .
so ... so , not so optimistic .
so , my lord , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands .
yeah .
if you look at people who they have to do ...
there are some places that we can apply to .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera , &quot; that we wanted to lead a nuclear war .
it turns out it meant actually , &quot; we want to do nothing with your film . &quot;
and just disappeared all these companies , one after the other .
not wanted to do something with the movie .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
and i was confused because i thought the whole concept of advertising is the idea of advertising , your product as many people as possible , so many people like possible .
especially in the world today , at this interface of new and old media and the fragmented media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea that the mass of this new exciting , which is the mass of this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a mistake , and that was what it was .
actually , no , that was not the mistake .
that would have been no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is , is a problem .
look , if you &apos;re in the field of transparency , this is one of the first images that seems to be .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and the very , just to discover and diagnose , immediately , understandable by visibility and access to information , especially what &apos;s the most important thing -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a whole lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but if it comes to that , it &apos;s going to be done , it changes something .
but why ? well , transparency is scary -- like this strange bear , which still pulls out .
it &apos;s a little bit of the way that these strange highway .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is still risky ?
a whole dish cool food .
that &apos;s very risky .
so when i started talking to companies , and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid and my father was lying in lying -- and there he is sitting and looking at me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , it &apos;s three versions of the story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
but there &apos;s only one company , a agency , to help us -- and that &apos;s just because i &apos;ve been talking john bond and richard &apos;s years since years -- i realized i had to do it alone , i had to go to the middle of
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , a broad problem .
i have friends who make big , giant , giant , giant , and i have friends who make little bits of glass like me .
and my friends , the great , giant , giant , giant , is that the reason your movies are so successful , is the most successful thing that you have .
and then my friends , who are making little bits of glass , &quot; well , how do we compete with these big , gigantic , giant , giant ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the world &apos;s &quot; the &quot;
so how exactly are we going to see the movie in the movie ?
whenever i do it , and i always , if i open the way to open the world , you &apos;ll see the word of the water .
and every time i do somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you so far ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you calm .
so maybe you should be a little bit of this interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great things .
either &quot; fusion fusion &quot; or &quot; paradise &quot; , you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped for men as well as women -- solid , or a stick , whatever .
this is the most popular .
now i can answer all of your questions and give you a more powerful version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand a brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so , these things are doing -- you know , people remember refugees -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
what words would you describe ?
watch is a lot of time .
this is a great question .
girl : technology technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone is doing under the upgrade .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that these category really makes a difference to something positive , unlike &quot; fighting smell and moisture . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three times fresh .
these things have a more positive effect .
and this is a very reactive .
what about me ? what about the most powerful ?
i have to talk to the man on the street that are like me , the way i do it .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like to be nice clothes .
&apos; 80s , &apos; 80s , he &apos;s on the street , except at the bottom of the day .
well , what is the brand of the brand ?
unique .
i think the most important thing that i have , the style i have , is probably &quot; the glamour glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , many of the things that are like this .
but normally i have a computer designer , like miriam , or a jewelry and so stuff .
if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classic settlement .
the brand i &apos;m , i &apos;m , is , i would say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; fly fly . &quot;
and , part of a girl , part of the doodle , part of the idea of the , part of the world -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the most popular .
i sell the whole country in the entire country , around the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was a little bit of a time .
man 5 : brand the brand of the piano .
is this ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a computer maker .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t be all the most popular , but i often see myself on the interface of the glamour glamour and the fly fly .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed a experts .
i needed somebody who could go into my head , someone who could really help me understand what you call the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot;
and so i found a company called olson &apos;s brain in the prison .
they have companies like the design of the fish , and they helped to discover these kinds of things .
if you could do it for the do , you could help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me just a little bit about how this is related to your thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who are making my worldview .
tell me about this world .
so , the world is , this world ? i think the world is the world where you live -- how people around a world , the friends , the family , the way you live , the work and so .
all these things came and start from a place , and for me , and start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s next to you to talk about .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is that to the thought and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; -- what does it bring us ?
what &apos;s the most important thing ? what &apos;s the most important thing ?
why is it important , what is the red ? what is the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little more about them , that they &apos;re not .
what else do you have through ?
... that doesn &apos;t have to be afraid . what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
so , no , no , thank you .
thank you for your patience .
yeah . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be made of it .
there &apos;s a lot of crazy things that went out there .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their favorite two separate , but the pages of the pages -- the morgan &apos;s , is a very , a little brand .
so , that &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies are going to focus on a strength rather than both .
many companies tend to be -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid that they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re afraid , they &apos;re afraid , and they &apos;re actually going to be a little bit more positive , and they &apos;re actually going to be a
what other brands do ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , target , wii , little little little metal of mini and metal .
now , there &apos;s a lot of brands and the brands , these things that come and go , but a more powerful , a brand brand , is a pretty strong thing .
a more powerful , brand brand . how is your brand ?
if somebody asked them to describe their favorite , their favorite , their favorite , how would they be ?
they &apos;re a little bit of a car ? are they something that makes blood in a plastic factory ?
or are they more like a more powerful ?
are you something that a little calm , more conservative , is it ?
the things that are , the basics , are the playful , fresh as the most prolific , recyclable , fuzzy , failed and more cosmopolitan , and the way that we have a lot of the time , agile and agile , and the way that they do
or are they more like a more like a design ?
are they mindful and more vulnerable like the sun ?
are they established , traditionally , more , more powerful , more compassionate , like oprah ?
are you reliable , stable , more safe , safe , secure , sacred , sacred , and wise , like the dalai lama or a little bit ?
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies , the up and the ones that were up and the &quot; no &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they wanted to do nothing with this movie , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but it &apos;s going to be 17 , which was ready to get to the control of that control that would be able to do with someone who wanted to do business and make mistakes like me and the other , and then we &apos;re going to tell stories
they &apos;re going to tell us the story of the world &apos;s history , as we tell the story in this movie that you &apos;re using the story of the brain today to make the brain flow of the brain , both to make advertising as well as movies
we went to sao paulo , where we were banned , where we were banned .
in the entire city , there &apos;s no way for five years , no poster , no poster , no one .
and we drove in school school where companies are moving their way into poorer schools , in all america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback or where i had the biggest success , those are where i interact with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they were the middle of the middle , they thought they were the agencies , and they said that the agencies may not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people think is going to challenge us to challenge our view .
and how did that be for you ? what it was successful ?
now , because the movie in the title festival festival was going to be the first time we can look at this .
according to the first time , the first thing was , in january , and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million of the film of this film .
that &apos;s actually a period of two weeks of two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film hasn &apos;t been left .
there &apos;s no time online . no , no more .
it &apos;s not in other countries .
well , finally , the film has reached a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every ad we were talking about , their clients , who have been , to let the fingers of it .
something i think is that if you give your chance to take risks , risks that in these risks are actually going to be able to make possibilities .
i think if you keep people out of it , you &apos;ll get it closer to failure .
i think if you &apos;re training your employees , you &apos;re going to take risks , you &apos;re prepared to get a profit to get a profit .
i feel that we have to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people not to have fear of opportunities that you might be able to do .
finally , we should be able to be afraid of fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
they welcome the fear . they welcome the risk .
one big taste of it , so we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , we get a little bit of honesty .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; they &apos;re welcome to transparency , &quot; was presented by my good friends of the world &apos;s worth of rock , which paid $ high for the football system .
big data is turned into the world in large opportunities in the world .
and the name is , &quot; they welcome transparency &quot; transparency .
thank you .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , what is the right thing to do with the $ $ $ a dollar ?
this is a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , and i put on the front of the street , the most cosmopolitan of the street , the most cosmopolitan -- a check in altitude of $ 1 , to fund my favorite year in the next year .
my name is a little bit of a sudden .
18 months ago , i was doing something else at google , and i &apos;m going to make something with museums and art . my favorite , which is also , i have the green light , i was getting green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of the research projects and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and explaining access to this slide .
i grew up in india .
i was a great education of mine -- i don &apos;t have to -- but i had no access to many museums and this artwork .
when i went to visit , and these museums , i started to learn a lot .
and while i worked for google , i tried to do this desire -- art to make a lot of work together .
we then put a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you &apos;re just going to be too detached .
you can look around all these museums here .
there &apos;s the most important thing that moma , the moma , the most cosmopolitan , the van gogh .
i actually come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get on two because it &apos;s very simple .
and the math , and it &apos;s in this museum , you know , in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you &apos;re walking around and you get poorer .
you want to be put in the museum ?
open the map , and jump with a click .
they &apos;re in it , they want to go to the end of the gangs .
just further . a lot of fun .
look at it .
thank you , but the best thing is coming .
so i &apos;m a front of my favorite , a little bit of my favorite , a riot in the met .
i see this stereotype .
if the museum gave us the picture , it click on it .
this is one of the images .
this is all the metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i &apos;ll click away now .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve been covering with the so-called so-called the so-called .
this picture for example , about 10 billion , i think , is about 10 billion .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you this .
you can get very easily in and you can get it in .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is immoral .
but then you really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there &apos;s something going on .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and i realized slowly that these kids actually beat something .
i was doing a little bit of a little bit of known with a few known known in the met , and actually found that it &apos;s a game called the &quot; playing game &quot; with a stick on the outskirts of a stick .
it seemed very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really go close to the end , you can go to the wild .
just to give you the point of view , i &apos;m out of that , so you see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best thing is , in a second .
let &apos;s jump fast to moma , again in new york .
another more powerful thing from me , i &apos;m going to go .
and the previous example was to find detail , to find detail .
but what if you want to see the brush stick ?
and what if you want to see van gogh &apos;s masterpiece , because of this masterpiece ?
you &apos;re in the place . you can actually go into it .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my favorite projects , and i &apos;m going to zoom in to the most successful .
this is a little bit of a time , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there &apos;s many more , but i &apos;m missing time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called the collections .
each of you , every one -- the same , whether rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and create your own museum online -- from all these pictures you can put your own collection .
just , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of the design -- you can get the power of the power .
this is the most popular , in the middle of the world .
you can put everything with comments , send your friends , and so a conversation begins about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , for me , the main thing is that all the wonderful things here don &apos;t come from google .
they &apos;re not even coming from the museums .
i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was a experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to be just with this digital medium of art , and they represent it online online .
and the biggest question that i asked is , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a football system ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s supposed to add the experience .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided into two halves .
this is the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , the intuitive side is .
if we had a measure of the scale of every hemisphere , we could be able to put their brain .
for example , this one is that someone who &apos;s completely logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have decided to have one of these extremes , but i think , for most people in the audience , their brain looks like this -- with a high amount of water that is at the same time in both of the hemispheres .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or something like that .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i see myself as one of the people , with most experimental experimental folk , which requires a good fraction of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good fraction of intuition to actually do experiments .
how do we develop these intuition ? well , we love playing things .
so we go out and play with it and then look like it &apos;s responding , and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that a thing can be just at the same time .
i mean , it can sound strange about thinking that a thing is at the same time at two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed them .
i remember seeing a child playing on a computer scanner .
he was a toddler and not very good at it , and he kept constantly .
but i bet that it taught him to play a very valuable lesson , which is the great things you don &apos;t just let you go and do it in a place .
and this is a great model of the world , so long they &apos;re not a viable model .
it would be a terrible model for a computer company because they don &apos;t play with the same thing , but with these little weird particles .
and if you play with your particles , you &apos;re all stuck in the kind of weird things -- like you &apos;re flying directly through walls , or you can be at the same time at two different places .
and so they all wrote these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the physics of the physics , a few years ago , and you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need to describe the big everyday objects around us .
that &apos;s not what my intuition was , and maybe i just don &apos;t have to play with particles .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical side is not liked it .
because if all of the things are made out of particles and all these particles of quantum mechanics , then they shouldn &apos;t just follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that should not be that way .
so i would feel better about the whole thing , if we could show that everyday objects are also following the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a few years ago to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see in the most violent fashion industry .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
here i &apos;m going to zoom out . we look at the center here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal , and it &apos;s shaped as a launch of metal , and it &apos;s about the edge .
so i made this thing on the same way that you make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new york , and i went to a new set of hours of all the big devices .
for the last little , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like a swimming pool and get the thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the most powerful fashion industry , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people go up and i hear all of these things because i don &apos;t want to bother them , or , frankly , they &apos;re not going
so quantum mechanics says that the objects are just feeling the same thing .
the fellow fellow fellow objects are not just people , but the light that seems to you , and the wind that seems to you and the wind of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is acting , we had to get out of the whole metal system .
and we did that .
we turned the light off , put it into a vacuum and the whole air , and it &apos;s almost the air , and it &apos;s almost to the right , and it was the piece of metal , and it was the piece of metal , like always
so we measured his movement .
we found that it &apos;s really weird .
instead of just getting there , it &apos;s just a little bit like it &apos;s a little bit like this , the way it was like this -- like a little bit of the time , like a little bit of the time , and together , and together
we gave him a little push , we could actually vibrate it at the same time , and not to vibrate -- something that allows only to be in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what really fantastic .
what does it mean to vibrate for the same time and not vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion of atoms that are the piece of metal is still there , and the same atoms move on and down the same atoms .
just to make them agree .
the rest of the time are they &apos;re tuned .
that means that every atom is at the same time at two different places , which is the same thing that is the whole piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
this was worth me for all this year in the clean room , because , you check that , the most powerful between a single atom and this piece of metal is about the same atom between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at two different places , this piece of metal can be on two different places , why not it ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side is .
so , imagine you were at the same time at a couple of places , how would that feel ?
how would you deal with that that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we put it out , the light is going to be the light and the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece of metal .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator are actually just a three-dimensional objects that are together in a small room together .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s still deeper .
it &apos;s that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the profound and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we should be thinking about economic development as we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families think about where they live and work , they have given the opportunity to choose between at least one hand of different cities that all of them are in competition for new residents .
now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries that are not even a single city that they would welcome to .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more worth to build it .
so we could just just do the world with a very simple , maybe hundreds of new cities .
now , this may sound absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
now , trade just from apartments against the cities .
imagine half of the people who want to live in homes , they did this , but the other half of them don &apos;t .
they could try to expand the capacity of existing apartments .
but you know what you would be going to be in , in these apartments and their environment , to avoid the laws of the world and to get away from the way .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to keep all these big underground units .
but you could go to a completely new place , and build a completely new block of building , and the laws would be there , and they wouldn &apos;t be able to support it .
so i proposed that governments create new surfaces , which are enough to provide a city , and they gave them a name : charter cities .
later , i found that , about the same time , the same time , the same time , and the challenge of a reform of reform in proteomics .
they knew that every year , about 75,000 miles of their country , they were leaving their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the
in this point , the way that we have a lot of time to say , &quot; what happens when we put a space of our country in the country , what if we just put it a message in the country , a part of the canadian embassy
in 2009 , in 2009 , under a severe school rate .
the next election election , the other election , won the scottish savage in a shift whose program , both innovations , promised the program .
he asked him to be a member of his life .
in the meantime , i was preparing to talk to tedglobal .
and by improvement , and by studying consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter city to basically reduce elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t be able to be able to get existing in existing terms .
we pay new technologies , but for the progress of progress , it &apos;s technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that we have to get back .
in the fall 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk .
and again , it showed him .
the two calls me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december of a hotels in miami in the hotel of a hotels .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , to be much more valuable than they &apos;re cost .
and i used this chart to show how valuable the value of the world is like new york , think about it , that a space in some cases is worth thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at a point when there was a pause , and he said , &quot; paul , we might be able to look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk in very simple form is that a charter city is a place that is beginning to be the beginning of land , a computer that defines the laws that are there and the people who have the opportunity to decide either to live under these rules
so i was asked by the president of proteomics , who meant that we need to make this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way that we have to bring our country to the planet .
i was asked to come to the fourth and the fourth , and i was going to give a talk to the fourth and fifth january .
so i &apos;ve given another one to facts , which is a graph like this , which has tried to prove that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it must be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch represents the new airport , which was built in denver .
and alone , this airport has a surface of 100 main years .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the most of the time to build a new city , you have to start with a field of at least 1,000 times .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand acres .
polite have all the main problems .
the faces of the audience were very serious and carefully .
the leader of congress came to the stage and said , &quot; professor , i thank you , thank you for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i came to the punch line that a new city offers the people new possibilities .
there would be the possibility in a city that would be in proteomics , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also includes new opportunities for leaders .
the leaders of the government in proteomics would depend on the help of the aid , they could benefit from their own , which they would make in the laws of the law and to support the laws that they can actually get to the charter .
and the realization of president lobo , was that the confidence of the common i thought was a way to get the foreign investors to come and build this city for all the parties in hinduism , which have been suffering for many years and mistrust .
we &apos;re in a field of dangers .
this is a picture of this place .
it &apos;s just a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly after , at the 19th of january , they have voted for a change for the constitution to have a change of the constitution that &apos;s been used for special amounts of control .
in a country that has just a violent crisis behind , in congress , for these kinds of years , congress voted with a voice .
all parties , all the main community , supported this .
and to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
on february february , it was approved to a voice with a voice .
immediately after that election , between the 21st and the 24 february , a delegation of about 30 , the two places in the world , the most interested in the world , were the most interested in the business of the world &apos;s business .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new urban , which built in south korea , and the central urban city .
all you can see on this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the toyota .
the other place that was very interested in the urbanism is singapore .
it &apos;s been built two cities in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you look at it , it &apos;s a convenient thing to think about today .
they already have a computer company ; they &apos;re already looking at this area for the second city .
it &apos;s been working on a legal system that allows us to participate , and it &apos;s also working on an external system .
a country already has offered his top court to provide the supreme court for the state of the system of the system of the system .
also , and the most important thing is , they &apos;re very interested in the .
they even bring funding with one .
one thing you already know was already understood , there &apos;s a lot of plastic types .
there are many businesses that would like to put in america , especially in a place with a free trade , and there are many people who would like to live there .
in the world , there are 700 million people who say they want to live permanent in another place .
a million people have left in latin america and go into the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to leave their families to go to work sometimes , sometimes they &apos;re single mothers who have to make enough money to make food and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s even kids who try to find their parents , who are in some cases , in some cases since a decade .
so what is it for an idea to think about this in proteomics , a completely new city ?
or even to build these cities , or hundreds of people around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to make that every family has a choice between a few cities that are in competition for new residents ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends from uzbekistan asked me to say , thank you ted .
you know how many decisions do you do in a typical day ?
you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve done a poll about 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that are a typical american is a typical american day .
and also , recently , a study was done with ceos that they saw for a week for the ceo .
and these scientists just documented the different themes with those who are engaged in the ceo , and how much time they spent decisions with the issues that are related to the issues .
and they found that a average ceo is busy working on the week with a little bit of work .
each of these topics was from many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions needed an hour or more of their time .
think of your own decisions .
you know how many decisions you meet in the nine minutes of a category in the one hour ?
how good do you think they &apos;re going to be able to cope with decisions ?
today , i want to talk about one of the biggest most popular of our modern time , the most important thing .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;ll ask you some questions and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise it , because i &apos;m blind , just the hand if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i &apos;m going to ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , so my first question for today is : are you ready to hear something about the most important ?
thank you .
when i was a college professor at stanford university , i went to this very very very very , very rigorous store , at least at the time he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was called the most salient .
this business , it was almost like a football machine .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and oil and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was a time when we actually drink the same thing .
i loved it to go to this business ; but at a time i asked myself , well , how does it come to buy you never buy anything ?
here &apos;s the olive oil .
they had over 75 different kinds of oil , including the ones that were locked in boxes , which came from a thousand years old .
so i decided to go to the leader of the day , and i asked the head , &quot; works this model , that they really offer people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up the most popular of tourists that came every day and usually their cameras had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment and we chose to do a little bit of the experiment for our experiment .
here &apos;s her favorite gang .
they had a different species of plastic types .
we &apos;ve set up a little bit of a little bit of business on the entrance .
we put six different tastes there , or 24 different tastes , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i &apos;ve looked at what &apos;s going on , and one thing , i think , is that i would have more people who are going to
it &apos;s more people , if it was 24 percent , about 60 percent , when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what the people were doing , and we were looking at the people who were going to buy a glass .
now we saw the opposite effect .
and the people who were standing in the face were only three percent , just three percent of them actually bought a glass .
from the people who stayed as it were six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of glass .
now , if you calculate it , people bought six times a glass of glass , who they had six to choice when they had 24 to choice .
now , to decide not to buy glass is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the most important thing is that the most powerful thing is affecting us .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it &apos;s against our own best interests .
so the theme of the day : financial saving .
i &apos;m going to describe a study that i &apos;m going to do with a little bit of the time that i was doing with a little bit of the time , and i was doing the decisions that we were doing , and we were doing the decisions
and what we looked at was whether the number of the people who were able to have a kind of a design plan that was going to be able to affect the probability of whether more for tomorrow is saving .
and we found that there was actually a correlation .
so in these plans , we had about the same plans that people had offered to something between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund were offered that , in fact , participation was lower .
if you look at the extreme , the plans that have two fund offered , a more powerful in the 1970s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that almost 60 fund offered , the most prolific oil rate fell on about the u.s.
now , it turns out that even if you &apos;re going to participate in the way more possibilities to choice , even then it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate in the more ways that the more possibilities they were available to , the more they were being avoided and choose to choose .
the more opportunities they were available to , the more they put their money in pure water .
none of these extreme decisions , to the decisions that someone would recommend , if we care about their future financial well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential negative consequences that offer that to provide more and more choices with themselves .
they push the decision -- push them , even if it &apos;s against their own best interest .
they &apos;re more likely to make worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to decide to make things that they &apos;re less satisfied to themselves , even if they make it objective better .
the main reason that we might enjoy it is that we might enjoy these huge shelves of the full set of paper , mustard , oil and oil , but we can &apos;t actually compare the comparison and the limiting , and then actually choose something from the fantastic
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested on different kinds and different kinds of different forms of time -- which you can just apply in your business .
first , just narrow .
they &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true as today that less than that .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; narrow . &quot;
they always worry that they lose the damage .
but in fact , we see it more and more , that if you &apos;re ready to narrow , and the more irrelevant possibilities will be going to be , well , there &apos;s a rise of sales , it &apos;s going to be reduced to the cost of
as a designer , and gamble , the different head of head and the other head of 26 on 15 , they had reduced a rise of sales to 10 percent .
when the golden corporation corporation sold her 10 at the worst of the worst , she experienced that the profits were growing by 87 percent -- a result of both , the rise of sales and reducing cost .
you know , the average average of the average today is giving you 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart is giving you 100,000 products today .
but the most popular supermarket , the world &apos;s supermarket today , is a lot of the world &apos;s supermarket , and they &apos;re just offering them 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in doses .
now in the world of the world &apos;s world , i think one of the best examples that have recently come on the market , about how to get the choices to the best , was something that david &apos;s very strong is a program , it &apos;s a
every single harvard harvard staff now takes employees to a piece of time .
those who really want to make a choice , 20 fund , they &apos;re offered , not 300 or more fund .
you know , how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to do it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how to distinguish the possibility of each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t be able to get them , they can &apos;t do their customers . &quot;
now before we started tonight , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer all the people in this audience a little bit of a street on the most beautiful road of the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read you the reading .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a few seconds to read them and then please clap them , if they &apos;re willing to take gary &apos;s supply .
okay . everybody &apos;s ready to take gary &apos;s offer .
are that all ?
well , let me show you something more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who is ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve heard more hands .
good .
the fact that you &apos;re looking at is the first time that you had more information than the second time , but i would be able to guess that it was the second time you thought it was real time .
because the images were made for them real sense .
what brings me to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of the problem of the world &apos;s problem is the most important thing .
it &apos;s about understanding people to understand the difference between possibilities , understanding what consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that &apos;s what you need to be very vivid and capable of .
why are people spending about 15 to 30 percent more if they use a card card or a credit card , when they use a cash card ?
because it doesn &apos;t feel really money .
and it turns out that if you make it , something feels specific , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people more .
so we &apos;ve done a study that i &apos;ve done with a computer company , and we &apos;ve done a study with the people who have done a study with people who have been working on the team of the world -- employees who have been working for the
and while this meeting , we have this meeting just as you &apos;ve always been , just as you &apos;ve been , just added to a little bit .
the little thing that we added to , we &apos;ve been asked to think that we asked people to think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they were saving money .
in the way that we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation to 20 percent and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or a rise to four percent of the amount that they were willing to pay
the third technology : the main thing .
we can deal with more categories than with more choices .
here &apos;s for example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a field of a field .
it turns out that in the upper industry , it &apos;s the top of the northeast industry , and the bottom of the northeast area , the number between the number of magazines , has been highly charged by magazines to the top of the magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines , and you &apos;re going to show you 400 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 magazines , and that in 20 categories , you think i &apos;ve given you more choices and a better job of time when i had given
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different types of dna .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; the &quot; jazz &quot; .
if you think that the left display is the left , and the ad on the right is jazz , then they clap into the hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that the one on the left is jazz and the ones on the right is , you clap , please clap .
okay , some more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz and the right is the right , but you know what ?
this is a very high kind of water .
the categories have to say something , not the choice of the choice .
and this problem often looks at you when you look at the long lists of all these fund .
who are you going to do with that ?
my fourth technology : assumption for complexity .
it turns out that we can actually deal with more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we have to slow the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german inversion , which gives you the opportunity to get your car completely to the car .
they have to make 62 different decisions to make their car completely .
now these decisions are different in the number of choices that they offer a decision .
so , the car , the car , the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
what i &apos;m doing now is i change the order of the decisions that make decisions .
half of the customers will be about the many possibilities , 56 of the ways to get 56 , four gears .
the other half of the customers are about the low possibilities , four gears , to the 56 of the city , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
how interested they are .
if you use the most sophisticated thing in the decision , that means that they &apos;re being overwhelmed , the most powerful , i &apos;m losing them .
what you &apos;re finding is that people who go from the many to the low levels of people are always going to pick up the most low .
we lose them .
go from the little choices to the many , then you stay in .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the order of this information .
when i start with the simple start , i &apos;m learning how to go .
even though the gears choose to pick me up , nothing about my preferences in the interior , it &apos;s still making me choose to choose .
it also puts me into excitement about the great product that i &apos;m going to do , and so i &apos;m willing to get to be interested in being interested in this .
let me summarize .
i told you about four techniques that the problem of the world &apos;s problem -- limited -- will be the surplus alternatives ; it &apos;s -- do it real ; we can put it in more categories , and we can engage with more categories , less options .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help you manage the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for people who offer service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re picking up in choice .
and the more we choose to pick up , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin gardner , who &apos;s a youtube , and i &apos;m looking at youtube .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are going to be solved , and then , why is that important .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singer , comedians -- when i was young , that seemed so infinitely difficult .
but the way we have it is that we can all be able to be very famous or all our creative activities of the world in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to the next saturday .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours of video is uploaded a minute .
and again , it &apos;s just a tiny percentage of the percentage , and it &apos;s going to look at thousands of times and so on .
so how does that work ?
three things : the most unexpected , the unexpected and the unexpected .
well , we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
whoa !
so , the math system , the baby .
last year , the video of this video was sending this video that he filmed in the southern national park .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this chart shows how it was popular when the video was popular for the first time .
actually , no viral video wanted to do a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing that , if you &apos;re in a dead mountain , you &apos;re going to be in the mountain .
he had uploaded a lot of the internet .
and this video was actually sent in january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jimmy atwood .
jimmy ornish would send the tweet , the video of the last , so popular .
because the way jimmy atwood are asking us new and interesting things , and show them a big audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday . pop down down on friday . and there &apos;s a friday line down to the top of the street , and it &apos;s the most slow to the street , and friday , friday , friday . you didn &apos;t think we would
rebecca paravicini &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was almost 200 million times a year .
this is what the graphics looked like .
just like &quot; double &quot; , it seems to be nothing to be like .
what &apos;s happening in this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also more sinister .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , the most important thing that we did is , many blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson &apos;s science theater was a first , which was a joke in twitter .
and it &apos;s important that a person or a group of the group of the group took a point of view , shared with a big audience and accelerated the process .
then these community formed from people who shared this big joke , and they started talking about it and to mess with it .
now there are 10,000 more of the gold , &quot; friday &quot; in youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a spoof for every single day .
unlike the most successful conversation of the 20th century , the community is the way that we &apos;re going to be part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or something new from it .
&quot; the &quot; s &quot; is animation and music in the field of music .
that &apos;s it , just simple .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
and if you hold that for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a more powerful one that has been looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats who look at this video .
it &apos;s important , the creativity that is in the most competitive and the geeks .
there were thread .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole of the entire world &apos;s land took out of the ground that made it a stupid joke to something that we can all participate in .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure to something , we do .
who could have all this kind of questionable ?
who could have predicted &quot; double &quot; or rebecca black or rebecca black or &quot; rebecca &quot; ?
what would you write in the writing of the world that &apos;s like that ?
in a world where every minute of video is uploaded video , only unique and unexpected , as the mentioned , video is mentioned .
i &apos;m not going to be very interested in , i was not interested in a friend , i should look at this great video , about a guy who &apos;s in new york against traffic bikes .
i got a ticket , because i &apos;m not on the top of the day , but there &apos;s often disabilities that don &apos;t let you go to the most accurate on the ground .
and that &apos;s the very surprising and humorous , and it was a casey &apos;s funny idea , and his argument was looking at five million times .
this approach is true for everything we do creative .
and that &apos;s all that leads to a big question .
what does that mean ?
so , the math .
what does that mean ?
and the creative , creative , creative , is the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture , to anyone who has access to the audience and the audience that is very popular .
as i said , one of the most amazing stars -- justin bieber -- did his beginning at youtube .
no one has to give your ideas green light .
and today we &apos;re all feeling as a owners of our culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media and they &apos;re not making the media of the media today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the connectedness between women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of this connectedness in the lives of a four year-old girl , when they were about 30 years ago , was sitting in a little boat , and they were talking
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still composed .
i want to tell you about some of the most popular .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life &apos;s life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life was held by the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
hold it in the front of the eyes in the eyes of the eyes , like he must admit that his life had been a single waste .
the words , so long his friends , the same thing .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgot to be his life .
i had to worry that it was not free , and it was my job to learn that the story was really trying to crush us , but we were going to be done .
the next piece of puzzle shows how a boat in the early sea of the early sea is silent .
my mother may be 18 , when her father died -- already in a front marriage , with two little girls .
for them , life had asked her to do a job : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that they could fail .
after a four-year-old and a half year-old sweater , a boat still goes on the lake as a police officer .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear they had before pirates , rape and death .
as most adults on the boat wore a little bit of a baby , my mother was a little bit of a baby .
in a computer bank , my sister and i would have , and then my grandmother would drink .
my first memories are from this boat -- the steady of the engine , the clapping of the engine , the clapping of each wave on the front , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came out of many times , but from the most popular of the men on our boat , or the most of the men who didn &apos;t want to start six hours .
but i remember the lights of the coast coast of the coast coast , and the young man , who broke and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and on the taste of the first , the first one of the men
no apple ever tasted this again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next thing is , by four women , in three generations , that are developing a new life .
we went down to the street , one of the middle expeditions , which is the population of the world &apos;s population .
unlike the most successful , the existence of the existence of me was completely unknown , there was no more inclusive .
the smell of the world &apos;s smells came from the rest of the world .
and the most broken broken cell industry were between people who had one thing in common : they started new .
my mother worked on farms , then on a line of a line in a tin , six days , twice layers .
it was kind of like finding the time , english and the most successful .
we were poor .
every dollar was given , and it was put in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to do for it . mostly the new stuff came out of the second hand .
two of them for school , every one to cover the holes in the other .
a more powerful to the street , because she had to have six years .
and there were the rare ones , but they were painful , and there &apos;s a little bit of the time , &quot; asian , go home . &quot;
after home , where ?
something more profound in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a quiet voice , &quot; i &apos;m going to go from the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until her nightmares came to wake up .
she opened a computer , then he made a business , and she opened a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t have the change , angry and more motivated , and they were caught , and they caught children , caught between two worlds .
loans and sponsors were searching .
centers were built .
i lived in the prison lab .
in one , i was the classic asian student , who was the most salient demands of himself .
in the other , i was involved in insecure life , the tragic scars of violence , the most prolific and the isolation .
but so many of the years of help .
and because of this help , i was in my last year of the most popular year of the year .
and i was made by a computer company to the next , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous , of the most anonymous , was now tan le , refugee and social activist who was invited to speak to places that they never heard , and in homes , their existence would never have imagined .
i didn &apos;t know the point of the exhibition .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the most of the time .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to a routine and the comfort of life of an unknown computer , a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who were so personal for every day , and they were telling each other to the same bed .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old , as she was going to climb the boat .
no , no one was a way .
&quot; do it just , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about the design of the world and education , and the neglect of the most powerful and the most cosmopolitan .
and the more open i talked about , the more i should tell .
i met people in all the way , so many of them did what they loved , lived on the limits of the possible .
and even though i had my degree , i realized that i couldn &apos;t get to a career in law .
there had to be another kind of thing .
and i realized that it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , a maverick , a new , new picture -- and not just okay , but something you must be grateful , maybe a gift of the design of the brain .
because the main thing is that it can be so easy to collapse the horizons , so easily , that you can be accepted the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;m now enough from my favorite to know that , yes , the world , but not as you can do it .
possibilities that didn &apos;t have been allowed to be explicitly encouraged .
there was a energy , a groundbreaking optimism , a strange soup of humility and the most prolific .
so i followed my gut gut .
i collected a little team of people to me , for the test , &quot; not a challenge , &quot; which was a challenge .
we had no cents for a year .
at the end of each day , i cook a huge truck of soup that we shared .
we worked late in the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant ones , and we managed to do the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull in the u.s.
just one journey there .
my gut gut again .
three months later , i moved and the adventure went on .
before i leave the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time where the social norm and the local government was the most important person .
life has not changed since centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother was going to get her alone .
with 17 , she was the second woman of a retired woman whose mother suggested .
without support of your husband , she was worried about a big deal by bringing him to court and was in her own case , and a greater big deal than she won .
&quot; it &apos;s not &quot; turned out as a gorilla . &quot;
i just took a shower in a hotel hotel in sydney , when she died . 1,000 kilometers away in melbourne .
i looked through the computer and looked at the other side .
i knew she was coming to say to me .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in a buddhist temple and sat around her passage .
we told her stories and assured her , that we were still at her .
and to midnight , the monk came and said he had to close the swamp .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because they &apos;ve been holding them tomorrow , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t quit them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s going to be through the women .
you see who we were and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would be able to be able to get us into the mess .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i think it &apos;s still the boat .
who would ever wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , and i &apos;m afraid of the day .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous everybody , the wave , the most consistent , consistent , of the engine , the vast horizon , which doesn &apos;t guarantee ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and you could safely be able to do it , i would do it .
and also , the fourth mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it all photography at all ?
because this is a picture that you can &apos;t take with his camera .
but i started my interest in photography when i got my first digital camera , at age 15 .
i put it with my former predilection for drawing , but it was a little different , because the camera was actually in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you squeeze on the trigger .
so for me , it seemed to be more about photography , and i was going to be the right place to be right at the right time .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that &apos;s beginning to get the process to get the trigger .
photos like this : a construction site along a much more sophisticated road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and yet , a realistic level .
or photographs like this -- dark and the same thing , but all with the common goal , a realistic level .
if i say reality , i &apos;m going to be tuned .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can actually capture , but i want to look at it as if you could have that , on a photograph .
photos where you have to think a short moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about catching an idea , as really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how they can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality , where you can take different pieces and put them together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect physical objects that we can identify all of us in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , they can combine something that &apos;s still going to look at the other three-dimensional , as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so we &apos;re preparing our brains , because our brain is not really comfortable that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combine by photographs .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture realistic , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things that we don &apos;t think about in our everyday lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because otherwise you can just see it wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a realistic outcome .
as you can see , that &apos;s not three special images .
but you can combine something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
secondly , combined photos should have the same amount of water .
and these two images are going to meet these two demands -- from the same altitude , and the same thing .
third , it &apos;s about making it impossible to distinguish where the individual images start and end up by connecting them into it .
it &apos;s impossible to say , how the picture was actually composed .
so by putting color , contrast and contrast to the edges of the individual , photographic scans , like the sound of the individual , the same , you know , the color of the different images and disorders , we &apos;re going to see the limits between the
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that &apos;s just a landscape , and the bottom part is manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely composed of photographs of different places .
i personally personally think that it &apos;s easier to create a place , as a place , because you don &apos;t have to make any compromise with the ideas in his head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to try to plan them to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on a giant street .
the bank is from another place .
the most salient is from a quarry .
and yes , i even have the house on the top of red , to make it look like a swedish look .
so to get a realistic outcome , it &apos;s going to be seen by me .
i always start with a act , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of the different images .
and here &apos;s a very good job .
and then if you do good footage , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also pretty realistic .
so , it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that we &apos;re limited to is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic people fail .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we &apos;ve introduced to the most popular was to make a design project .
it &apos;s not particularly scientifically scientifically -- it &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea , and the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how do you go ? &quot;
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all of the electronic people -- maybe most of the electronic people have failed : because we stopped listening .
this is my favorite thing . a very simple thing .
she has a button , and it &apos;s made .
and every morning i jump on it .
and yes , i have a job , like you might recognize .
i have my job to get 95 pounds .
it &apos;s just working : every time i jump on the scale , it &apos;s also sending my data to google health .
and there are also from my favorite aunt , so he can see where my favorite card is , and it &apos;s not just in the moment that i &apos;m going to support , or that &apos;s what i need to do , but also with a look at
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you know , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 to twitter on twitter .
so every morning i jump to my favorite and people talk to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; for lunch , just a little bit of a little bit of life today , &quot; i &apos;m going to go to lunch . &quot;
but this is the most important thing that can happen because this is the pressure pressure , pressure , to help patients , because it could be used against obesity , or it could be patients smoking .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and to bring them together , to play some kind of game , to control their health better .
next week , this is coming on the market .
it &apos;s going to give this little little bit of a little bit of the time that you &apos;re typing on an iphone or something .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure , send it to their physician and share it for example , for something more than 100 dollars .
in this point , patients come to play . they can &apos;t only take control of the control , captain on their own ship , but also help us in health care , and the health care of health care , the most demand , and so on .
do the methods that are easy to use and start to hug patients in the team .
and that can be done by these kinds of ways , but also by sweating .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done is i want to share with you a quick video .
we all have the most violent in our cars .
maybe in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all the machines around the street are around .
we know one where all the stations are .
and sure , we can find the most powerful .
but where would the next ted system to help this patient ?
we have a lot of time , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next life-saving bone was in this moment .
so what did we do ? we did it in the netherlands .
we built a website , and a crowd asked , &quot; if you see a little bit of a sudden , please share us where he is , when he &apos;s closed , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , of course , as a result of the day
and over 10,000 years of time , already in the netherlands , they were reported .
the next step was to find the apps for this .
and we &apos;ve created a design system .
we &apos;ve developed an app for the design of design , extended reality to find these kinds of things .
and if you &apos;re in a city like a city , and someone is collapsing , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks you also have your own , to find the next little , saving life .
and we don &apos;t just want to just do this as a function of the product , as the product is called , but also as a result of the product .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues all over the world , from other universities , to help us behave like the learning of the world to make these kinds of things around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and someone is collapsing , it &apos;s your own familiarity or somebody else , you can find a kind of a plastic system .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies are helping us to help us in the world for the diagnosis of this .
these might be the most powerful , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the most important thing is that the most important thing is that the most important thing is that the most important thing is .
please help us and try and make it not just better to improve health , but to take your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report by unexpected discoveries .
i work in the most sophisticated .
and my little little bit of the time , we want to force ourselves to make it ...
... it &apos;s available to the approval .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take it to be a hurry .
now -- we can just skip this -- i &apos;ll just skip the video ...
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
so , the math is ...
oh , my time is already over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year and work in a environment that is so much everything that is really , really , what they hate , we have to work in government .
the program is called &quot; code for america &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the internet geeks .
we choose some fellows every year and we &apos;re going to work with it with a little bit of work .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them into the world .
and they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what you really do is to show what technology is possible today .
so you meet al .
al is a computer in boston in boston .
here it looks like he looks for a date , but what he really looks for is somebody who &apos;s going to be a little bit of it when he &apos;s a little bit of the snow , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at the most
how did he come to look at this particular kind of help ?
we had a team last year of fellows in boston , which is called &quot; code for america . &quot;
they were in february , and it has been much more popular in february .
and they realized that the city never had this fire fire .
but a fellow fellow , a man named erik &apos;s , and that was something else , and that was that the residents were free to get the sidewalks out of the line , right before these parts .
so he did what everybody would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire fire .
you &apos;re going to lift it up to him , if it &apos;s a meal .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game game .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that have written the fellows in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other species .
it &apos;s rapidly spreading .
there &apos;s this guy in the middle of the city , who has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but , for the citizens , the citizens adopt .
it &apos;s very important that these are the things that are working , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the app to get the citizens to clean up the people .
and chicago just introduced it to the people who are the most prolific , when it &apos;s a meal .
we now know nine cities that plan to use this app .
and she &apos;s been very prevalent , organic , of course .
if you know something about the world &apos;s surface , you know that it doesn &apos;t usually work .
the power of software takes a few years .
we had a team that worked last year in boston , for three people , two months .
it was about a method that parents can find out what the right public schools are for their children .
we had been told later that if it was about the normal channels , it took over two years , and it would have cost about two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not yet anything .
there &apos;s a project right now in the california law , which has cost the taxpayer to two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spreading from the front of the front , is a kind of shot on the institution of the government .
it &apos;s how the government could work better -- not more like a private company , like many people think that they should .
and not even like a computer designer , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , this app is that they represent a new generation that the problem of government is not as the problem of the government -- not as the problem of a collective institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at the collective act with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to make things effectively .
it &apos;s not just code for america , there are hundreds of people in all the country who are up and writing , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re dreadful , they &apos;re not frustrated with them , but they don &apos;t complain about it .
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all have your feelings about politics and the snake , and all the other things that we really upset about , is government , in the core of tim o &apos; s , &quot; what we &apos;re doing in common , &quot; which we
now , a lot of people have given the government to give up .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i &apos;m going to ask you that you &apos;re going to be able to do it , because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government finally takes their power out of us -- they &apos;re like , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , will affect how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and as many people , i thought it was mainly about choosing people in office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s mostly in community communities .
this is the call for service and information .
you usually come out , if you &apos;re in your town , you know , in the city of the city .
if you ever have to have the chance to work in your urban society , how our fellow scott scott &apos;s fellow is part of the program -- in fact , do you all -- you &apos;re going to see that people who call government , including a lot
so scott gets this kind of thing .
he &apos;s typing &quot; the &quot; s database &quot; in the official database .
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the ted system .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock is going to be the meat ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the world &apos;s end .
boston doesn &apos;t just have a call .
it has an app , a more powerful and a more powerful , called &quot; the &quot; aw . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work very smart people in the office of the new urban trade center in boston .
one day -- this is a real report -- this is in the way that i was in my trash , and it &apos;s not saying if you &apos;re dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; the &quot; s &quot; is different .
scott discusses human beings .
but on &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; is all public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post we got was , &quot; i went over there , the trash behind the house .
do you ? yes . alive ? huh .
turned the trash down . went home .
good night , sweet , sweet . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . this is the digital that &apos;s the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is to get into the approval .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i &apos;m not necessarily talking about a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m going to talk about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role here .
they connected these two people .
and you could have connect them with government performance if they were needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if a neighbor helps the other , we make our communities .
let &apos;s call the most powerful , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about it , that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they think that &apos;s the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is to vote .
how often have we chosen a political leader -- and sometimes we &apos;ve used a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we &apos;re going to go back and we expect the government to reflect our values and then not change much ?
this is because the government is like a further ocean , and politics is the top of the top .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we have , and we pay for that , and we pay for something that is going to work against us , something else , and then we &apos;re going to be ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want that institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real world &apos;s is happening .
we need to be able to get to the machinery of government .
so the most important thing is that it did .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned that wrote a very detailed report that has written a very detailed report to the most prolific of the world &apos;s rights .
this is not political being active , that &apos;s active .
now , for those of us who have given government to the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to introduce the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we have to reach what we need to do without improving the institution that can be in the name of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of government fundamentally , in a way , can actually achieve something that can actually achieve the society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the internet , and the white internet is that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to build the only systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up with her voice as granted .
they don &apos;t fight this battle that we all fight , so who can talk to who &apos;s going to talk .
you can make your mind , on every channel of time , and you do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the work of government .
and these apps are going to let us use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be a fire fire , a beard , to dig a trash plate with a plastic station .
and sure , we would have these fire fires all the time , and many people do it .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers who pay taxes and get to get their performance .
we &apos;re more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all got to you here : if it &apos;s about the big , important things we need to do together , all together , we will only be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually my role in explaining the people how wonderful the new technologies are , which are the emergence of the world , and i thought , i &apos;m here , i &apos;m going to tell you what i really think , and i &apos;m going to try to understand
i &apos;m going to start with you a single , boring slide .
... you could just show the slide .
this is a slide that i &apos;ve chosen from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather about the universal form .
this slide shows data of a analysis of the performance of the performance of the performance of the performance of a field of networks of networks .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , as many other people we find in our field , are a kind of a kind of a kind of a light curve .
in other words , every step here is a power in the u.s.
and this is a novelty that we need to use this guy on the scale of the technology in the field of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the light back .
something more delicious , because i &apos;m going to draw something on paper here .
now , why do we draw graphs in technology on the ground of the brain ?
the reason that i would draw it on a normal curve , where , we &apos;re going to say , this is the years of a kind , so the timeline of a kind , and this is a kind of observation of technology that i want to share
and then you look like this .
and that &apos;s not what we &apos;re saying .
now , if i want to record another technology , we &apos;ll say a more powerful , then that would come up with the scale of the scale , in the form of a flat line .
but if something like this happens , this is what the most powerful thing is happening .
so if the most fast thing is the speed of the progression , then we could get the same thing in a taxi and be in 30 seconds , we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not that fast .
there was never before in history in the history of the world &apos;s history , this kind of kind of carbon growth , which is increasing the scale of all the years .
the question i want to ask you is , if you look at this exponential curves , you &apos;re not going to go to it forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is going to be so fast and forever as fast as it is now .
there are two options .
either it &apos;s going to be a classic classic , like here , until something completely new comes to come , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
this is about it .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen in the way here .
so , it &apos;s really , then , we &apos;re in the middle of a transition in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition of the world , in a new way of the world .
so the question i want to ask , and i also often think of myself , is how this new world will be ?
what is this new state that &apos;s going to take the world slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing to be in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was a future somewhere in 2000 , and people were often talking about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
and we &apos;re not going to go on .
so in other words , the future has exploded every year for a year since i &apos;m on this world .
i think the reason is that we realize that there is something in it .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
and we know that it &apos;s just not a sense of trying to look at 30 or 50 years in the future , because everything is going to be so different that a simple block of what we &apos;re doing now is not a sense of what we &apos;re
now i want to talk about what this might be , this transition in which we are right now .
so to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really don &apos;t have technology or computers .
because i think that &apos;s really what we can understand , we need to go back to a step and look at the thing on a longer timescale .
and i want to look at this on the champs-elysees of life in the earth .
i think the big picture makes sense when you split it into some of the pieces of music .
so let &apos;s go back , and it &apos;s 2.5 billion years . the earth was a big , big , big , big , floating of chemicals .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , we have a pretty good picture about how they do the most powerful thing .
i also think there are theories that start to understand how everything has started rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of a little bit of a story of what is that that time , that &apos;s little oil pumps , which are different
some of these oil spills were a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from outside and grow .
all the ones were , they started to rebuild .
these little oil turtles were the most primitive of the most primitive .
but these oil turtles weren &apos;t about alive in today &apos;s sense , because every single one of them was just a little , casual recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , the chemicals have been distributed to the more unequal quantities .
so every single droplet was a little different .
in fact , the droplet of the growth had grown faster than others and integrated more and more chemicals from the outside and shared more chemicals .
so these are more likely to survive , and they &apos;re expanding in the other way .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , if this droplet of the thing learned about abstraction .
in any way we don &apos;t really understand that , this droplet of the ability to learn information is information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and in a certain chemical form , which we call dna .
in other words , they found in this particular field of evolutionary way , evolutionary way of being allowed to make them what they were doing , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is going to be about the time of 2.5 billion years , where they came up with the same .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same notation .
and that &apos;s the exact same thing that every living thing is , and the same code .
we &apos;re so far that we can only write , just to the design , even in this code .
and i have 100 main pieces of a white white , which i &apos;m trying to keep in airports from the street .
in this , what i &apos;ve done is , i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is made from normal letters , which we use to talk about -- and i wrote my business card on a piece of dna and have 10 ^ 22 times more .
so if someone wants to have a hundred million copies of my business card , i have enough for everybody in this room and even for everyone on this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was in fact , i &apos;d have been a kind of a design , and then i would have written them on a virus and put it in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna of dna was an interesting step .
and the most important thing that these cells -- they made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and that &apos;s where these cells started communicating and exchange information , so communities from cells came out of cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
this is why the consistency is growing to antibiotics .
some bacteria have found how they can stay from penicillin and have this information together with other bacteria in the dna and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate each other .
now this communication allowed the reasons of communities that were in a certain sense of the same boat ; they were the most powerful .
so they either survived together , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were repeated more often and from evolution .
the most important thing is there , where these communities are so close to the fact that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community in a more mature place .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at that point , we have communities , communities of many of the most powerful , highly skilled , which are acting as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a community of this community .
we have a lot of cells that are not on themselves .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started building , so that the level of the evolution was not longer the single cell , but the whole cell that we call the organism .
the next step is now happening within this community .
the most important thing started to abstract information .
and they developed special structures that didn &apos;t do anything else than information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the most powerful , which is the most sophisticated ones that have built these things .
they started to train specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and that &apos;s what information is about .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
and this gave you an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point , an individual -- learning happened now within the time of a single organism , rather than about this evolutionary period .
so , an organism could learn to eat a certain fruit , because she liked bad and she made it sick , and she made it sick , the last time he ate her .
now , this could happen within the lifespan of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because this information had to be learned by the individuals who died because of these fruit , because these are still not there .
so the nervous system has the most powerful thing with this particular kind of carbon system , because evolution could now take place within a single individual .
it could be done within a period of time .
what happened after that , the individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
so , as an example , the most popular version of this is the human language , the human language .
it &apos;s a fairly amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , sophisticated idea , and i was confusing to my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and basically give the sound sound of me , in hope with a similar idea of creating a similar idea in your head , which has a certain kind of resemblance with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , it turns into sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this is what we allow to do again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we , the human , is we started abstract .
we &apos;re the same stages that have gone through the same levels of time -- the abstraction of our methods , how we put data , we &apos;re presenting to process .
the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
so , computer engineers , computer , the , the spelling , and so on , are all our specialized mechanisms that we built in our community to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also , it &apos;s capable of developing faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today , evolution can happen in the time of microseconds .
you &apos;ve seen a little bit of the time of the brain , where he showed a little bit of evolution in the &quot; code &quot; program , right before your eyes .
so we have the most sophisticated time again .
the first steps of history , which i told you , took a billion years a piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , took some hundred million years .
then the most important steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be a few decades .
the process of itself is feeding itself and becomes , i think , the word is the word for -- if something is more powerful .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explosion .
we see the process that lives from itself .
i live living from building computers and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism i use to build computers , not use the recent progress in computing , without the recently , in computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design this in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor in the world &apos;s population is doing .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what designers do , and what the designers think of thinking is , we think about a certain kind of a little bit of a time , and that machine is doing something that makes our skills far beyond , better and faster
and it &apos;s partly about ways that we don &apos;t even understand the right thing .
a method which is particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been using in the last time is evolution itself .
we put a video tag in the machine , which is what &apos;s going on in the field of the world .
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s developed from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , &quot; please , a hundred million randomly chosen sequences of instructions .
now , please all of these random instructions , all of the programs , are all the programs , and then finally pick the ones that are my goals on the next . &quot;
so in other words , i first define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to make numbers of numbers that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve used for this .
so find programs that can be very much more common .
of course , the chance of random instructions is very small that they just have numbers of numbers , so they &apos;re not going to actually be the instructions .
but one of those things like a little luck with something is really lucky to get back to the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences , which are my goals on the next .
store this one , the rest of the rest .
now , all the population that the numbers have best address .
and that &apos;s a way of the design of the design , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their own , and the children are the characteristics of the world &apos;s properties of the two programs .
so i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that have come to the goals of the other .
say , &quot; please , this process . &quot;
so , astrolabes again .
maybe some mutations might be a few mutations .
and try and do this again with another generation .
all of these generations need a few milliseconds .
and so i can run a evolution over millions of years in the computer , or in more complex cases , some hours .
finally , i get programs that can be perfect .
the fact is that these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write from hand .
and then when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s obscure and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job , because you come from a series of a series of programs that have done the job .
because your life was going to be if you did the job right .
i sat in a 747 with marvin minsky , and he &apos;s a map of a card , and he says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
there &apos;s this airplane , &quot; is this airplane made of plastic , which is working together to make your flight safer . &quot; don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
we know that a computer system is not optimal when it becomes too complicated .
so we start to rely on computers , for a process which is different from the classical engineering engineering system .
he allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of it yet .
so , we &apos;ve got the technology .
we &apos;re using these programs now to make the computer much faster , so that we can do that , that we can do that even faster .
so it creates a laser model .
it &apos;s going to be faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies are feeding from themselves .
we &apos;re going to raise .
we &apos;re at a point that is analog at the time , as a result of the way that we have a lot of the time .
so we &apos;re the most sophisticated and we can &apos;t really make what we &apos;re doing here at the hell of the hell .
we &apos;re in the middle of this .
but i really think that &apos;s something that comes to us .
i think it &apos;s very much more powerful to say that we are the final one of evolution .
and i think we all are part of the creation of what &apos;s going on next .
now , lunch is before and i think i &apos;m going to hear before i &apos;m going to go .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert with a plastic hall in the desert with a plastic hall .
we talked about it , that nothing has changed since the time of ancient indian &apos;s mahabharata . &quot;
when we wanted to travel indians , we went into a car and we went across the sky .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
and then when the big indian was born , he took a bow , took a bow , fired in the floor and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with the computer technology and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that really made me sad .
i got a little scared of technology .
it was scared that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without a camera and without tweet to my friends .
i found that technology should make magic and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver fan .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the most important thing for me .
she became a world &apos;s access to a world full of pirates and the images of the images in my mind .
i came to the same way when we were holding our send clocks and cameras from it to dream .
they were inspired by being inspired by it .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic rather than killing .
with 16 , i started illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling , the readers in the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s bringing pictures and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
the storytelling of storytelling always took more senses .
but what do we do with that ?
i &apos;m just going to go to the street , a interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s what this box is , &quot; this box is going to write . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to get a character in the book .
and again , a letter for me down -- and the ipad knows through gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the child in me is really excited about this possibility .
i talked a lot about magic .
i mean , i don &apos;t mean a magician and dragon , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies found in a glass of a glass , and i always found it very exciting .
so you have to go out here and drop the ipad off .
and the light is the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a single brain .
and so every book , and every world , and every world , is a little bit of a little bit of a cerebral device that i &apos;m going to get here to the magic device .
and this opens up a map .
and the cards had always been maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows and it &apos;s going to be in the rest of the book .
it turns out to be other places in the book .
i &apos;m going to go in here .
it &apos;s important for me to make something that is more important , but also very much more powerful .
this is the most popular .
we &apos;ve all heard of the world &apos;s and the most powerful , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues , the most powerful ?
the poor were caught thousands of years in the grocery chambers , in a old book book .
and we bring them back to a contemporary history for children .
a story that &apos;s been changing with new issues , like the most powerful .
the theme of the last 10 years is a big problem of the last 10 years , that children in their rooms are sitting in their rooms , without out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;re sent to a search . you have to go out and collect the camera of the ipads of the brain .
as a child , i had collections of the steel of the , rocks , and the shells .
somehow , the kids don &apos;t do it anymore .
this is going to get returned . you have to go out to make a picture of a flower and tag a picture .
in another chapter , you have to be a piece of a piece of water and tag .
so , you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put online .
a child in london shows the picture of a football system , and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network about a digital collection of photos that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities that are the magic of the world and technology .
the next book we &apos;re planning to do is use a interaction that you use the video of the ipads and through augmented reality , which seems to be a plant of the house that appears to be a plant on the house .
and on a place , the screen is filling up with leaves .
you have to do the sound of the brain , and you &apos;re going to read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the forces of technology are getting closer and in the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and we closer to the natural world , and the magic , fun and love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really a very extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in the prison , prisons or a prison .
i spend most of my time with the social weakest in the world &apos;s business and places that are very much hopelessness .
and at ted , to see , and listening to how stimulating this is , i &apos;ve given a lot of force .
in the short time here , i was a clear one : ted has identity .
you can tell things about the world that have influence .
and sometimes , if something comes over ted , it gets a meaning and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we saw some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher have important , but the words of a dedicated teacher is particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . but as a doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i was big in a family , a traditional household household , which was dominated by a matriarch , and this matriarch was my grandmother .
she was a very strong , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every single book .
she was also the beginning of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a computer .
their parents were born in the 1940s in virginia as a slave .
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped her view very much .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met them as a little boy , they came to me and gave me a ph.d.
she was so stuck in me that i couldn &apos;t breathe . then she got me off .
one or two hours later , when i came to her , she came to me and said , &quot; do you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said no , &quot; no , &quot; i said , &quot; oh , i said , &quot; yes , i said , &quot; yes , i &apos;d leave you in quiet . &quot;
and she was something that was made , that you wanted to be in your near .
the only problem was that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins went around everywhere .
i remember , i have to have eight or nine , that i woke up one morning and went into living rooms . all my cousins went around .
my grandmother was at the end of the room and i looked at it .
first , i thought that was a game .
i saw her and smiles , but she looked very serious .
and that was 15 minutes , and then she stood up and came up to me . she took me on the hand and she said , &quot; come on , &quot; come on . you and i have to talk . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out and said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t have to be able to get it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , i said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me only three things , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i &apos;m going to love your mom to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby and you have to be with promise that you &apos;re always going to take care of them . &quot;
i &apos;m doing my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next to me , you &apos;ll always do the right thing . &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing .
i thought , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise me is &quot; you never drink alcohol . &quot;
now , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south and i have a brother who &apos;s older and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this kind of beer beer with my sister and i went to the forest and went to the forest .
we &apos;re just going around there as well as otherwise .
then he took a drink of beer and offered my sister to one of them , and she took me , and then she offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . already , you &apos;re just doing . i don &apos;t want to do beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , now we &apos;re doing this , you &apos;re doing anything else , you &apos;re doing anything we do .
i had what , your sister had what . go , a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . just do it . do you just . &quot;
my brother at the time .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , what &apos;s going on . &quot;
and then he looked at me in the face and said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t always do it crazy because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells everybody that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to give you something .
i should not do that .
this is perhaps a public transfer .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m going to be a drop of alcohol , i &apos;ve never been drinking a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s a lot of time . i say that &apos;s because identity means power .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people about things that they don &apos;t believe in .
we can get them to do things that they thought they could not .
of course my grandmother would say all of her grandchildren , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was in prison during the prison prison .
my uncle died of the u.s. illness .
and she believed that this is the issues that we need to take care of .
i tried to say something about our system system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1945 , 300,000 people were in the prison and in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest annual rate of the world .
seven million people are released on the verge of the day or with inefficient water .
i think that i think we have a fundamental change in the world .
in social , and black parts of the population , the population of despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of three male black black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , on the prison , or with a juggler , or with surfing .
in urban communities everywhere , from los angeles across philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of all black young men either in prison , in prison , on the outskirts of the city , or with a juggler .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have to do with the power of the world , it &apos;s also being replaced by poverty .
we have a court system that you &apos;re treating much better if you &apos;re rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
wealth , not draw , it affects the result .
but we seem to be very pleased with that .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a couple of things that are happening .
my home home is permanently pulling you the right to the right when you &apos;re convicted of it .
here , in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population is permanently lost their right .
we predict that in 10 years the average ratio of civic health is going to be so high as the most prolific of the world &apos;s population .
the silence is a lot of the silence .
i represent kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world , the most prolific children in prison .
in this country , there are children &apos;s lives for children &apos;s lifestyle , without any form of life .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of time .
the only country in the world .
i represent people in the field of affairs .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we think because you &apos;ve taught us that the real question is : does a human being made for a person to die for him ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other way is not : does anybody have a crime for a crime , but do we have it to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
on nine people we &apos;ve executed , one that we &apos;ve been executed , we have a popular discovery , which was released and out of death row .
an amazing thing . one of nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane if for nine planes , the one crash .
but somehow we can do it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question , whether we &apos;re right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m in my students african-american history , and i talk about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , the time against the end of the reconstruction , until the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
but for the african-american in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to fear fear .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror , which shaped her life .
these older people now come to me and say , &quot; mr , wal-mart , you &apos;re talking to you , you &apos;re telling people that you should stop saying that we should have to do it for the first time in our nation , after 9 / 11
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the mutilated and decades of the most motivated motivated submission and apartheid .
and yet , there &apos;s a dynamic in our country , and we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what the meaning of our actions have in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly hitting each other .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to be willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that the mutilated is not to overcome the willingness to the truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve been given some talks in germany about death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up after my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply troubling , you &apos;re talking to me . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , it can never give you more . &quot;
it was still silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever kill ourselves for the systematic killing people .
it would be a lot of us , consciously , and target people . &quot;
i thought about it .
as it would feel , in a world where german state had been human , the german state of people would be particularly , especially if there were a lot of jews .
it would be misled .
it would be a lot of time .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we &apos;re going to be people -- here &apos;s the risk of being convicted of death , 11 times higher , when the victim is white , when the victim is black , and
and yet there &apos;s this mental disconnection .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with this difficult topics , the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but ultimately , these realities are going to be suffering from suffering , abuse , sanitation , apartheid .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we ultimately talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to be able to be able to be in a complex world .
for me , the time is producing the time , and talking about the poor , the disadvantaged , the disadvantaged , who never will be at ted .
but think about a way that &apos;s embedded in our own lives .
we all have to believe in the last part of the things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re also rational , so we &apos;re very rational .
innovation , creativity , and development , don &apos;t just come from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this kind of thing that i think is that you &apos;re driving us , not just being open for all the light and the things that are , but also for the dark and the dark .
preity ornish : the great one , the great politician , once said .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe against oppression , we wanted to do everything , but what we needed most , was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be sometimes in a desperate place , and witness . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i think is also the most important thing to do .
there &apos;s no distinction to technology and design that allows us to be very human , and as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears , and injustice , and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity challenges very much more from us than if we didn &apos;t have it .
it &apos;s going to touch them deeply .
as a young lawyer , i &apos;m a great privilege to meet pink parks .
and the woman &apos;s hospital was coming back to the back of the day , where they were two of their oldest friends , and they had these older women , the most educated women , who had organized the most powerful , an incredible african-american -- and virginia
so these women were meeting and they were just talking .
and then , by the time , ms. , i was then calling me , and said , &quot; well , the woman park , woman park , we want to talk to the city . we want to talk .
do you want to come in and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very like . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just heard .
it was always so inspiring , so it was so inspiring .
one day i was sitting there and heard these women , and after a few hours , woman was told to me , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to say what the initiative is right now .
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go to injustice .
and people want to help people who were innocent .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the world .
we want to eliminate the lifestyle of the world without any form of life .
we want to do something against death companies .
we want to lower the number of death .
we want to eradicate the food . &quot;
i thought my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to go . &quot;
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
then she turned to me , and he said to me , &quot; and i put a finger on my face , and he said , &quot; and therefore , you have to be very , very reactive . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be the ted community .
we need to make ways to put ourselves together , and we have to ask these problems , this suffering .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a few very simple things .
that we all are more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every human being on the planet .
if someone lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t hear him , it &apos;s not just a lonely .
even who kills someone , not only a murderer .
and because that &apos;s what &apos;s like , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that needs to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think that in many places that are the opposite of poverty .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so stimulating , we &apos;re not going to be measured at the end of our technology , not in the things that we &apos;re developing , not in our intellect and
finally , a society is not measured by how they treated their rich and powerful and privileged , but how they deal with the poor , the terminal , the terminal , the terminal people .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us feel .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story to end .
sometimes i press too much .
i &apos;m going to get tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas are ahead of our thinking , in the very important way .
i represent these kids who were convicted of very hard disabled .
i go to the street and i go to a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and that &apos;s a grown as a adult .
then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn someone into something that he doesn &apos;t ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed too long and thought , my goodness , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he must have a lot of time .
right , the judge , the judge has a lot of the time .
you should also want to be the wish .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think more right , i started working on a bill .
i had a 14 year-old young young young boy as clients .
and i started with this bill . the headline said , &quot; bill , my poor , 14 black clients like a privileged , white , white , white . &quot;
i was explaining that a failure of the world &apos;s failures were to be the most powerful and the police and the police .
there was a crazy line about this , that in this country , there &apos;s nothing more delicious that there &apos;s only a mistake .
the next morning i woke up and i didn &apos;t know if i was just dreaming that crazy , or actually written him .
and i didn &apos;t just write him , but i was sent to the court .
a few months ago , i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to the court and this crazy case .
i went into the car and was really overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard to do so painful .
and finally , i went out of my car and went up the stairs to the court .
when i was the staircase to the court , there was a elderly , black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came over to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and gave me a hug .
then he went to the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched something very deep in me , identity , the ability to contribute every single one , to a community of hope .
well , i went to the street .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. fischer , did you put this crazy bill ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
that i had written these crazy things .
and the office workers came in and office workers and office workers .
in the most violent part , the most popular thing was full of people who were angry that we talked about skin color , about poverty , about inequality .
i looked at the janitors and i went out and down .
he always saw through the window and he could hear the whole thing .
he went and down .
finally , this older black man came with a very senior , very connected to the most common and sat straight behind me , almost on the street .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a pause .
during the break , a computer company came in , which was that the janitors were in the prison center .
this is the place that ran over the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the most responsible ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he saw the most popular , then he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m coming to say that young man , you lose the goal of the eyes , don &apos;t give it to the eyes .
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far more sinister , but that it &apos;s the justice of justice .
that we &apos;re not fully designed as humans , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and human rights .
that our survival is associated with the survival of every single one .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity , with humanity , compassion and justice .
and i want to say , most of all , i want to say that , just say , lose the goal , don &apos;t get the goal out of the eyes . don &apos;t give it .
they have seen this audience , this community , and you heard a obvious wish to help them and do something .
what can we do ?
and so , the fact is , well , there &apos;s opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a little bit of a time in this spring where it &apos;s about to actually do a effort to do something from the most responsible , which is the other thing that &apos;s going to be flowing in the politics of
here , in california , for example , you will be a billion dollars for the death penalty , a billion dollars for death .
and yet , 46 percent of all the oil companies don &apos;t end with a lack of an incredible .
56 percent of all the world &apos;s oil workers are not coming .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
this is a quantum record that will suggest money in more ways and security .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the most powerful is in america &apos;s immense .
this fact is often asked in a context with the increased oil industry .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
now , in fact , the number of the internet companies don &apos;t really change very much .
most of the most popular in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of the world &apos;s class .
it was the most popular pennsylvania against drugs .
so the dramatic numbers are coming in the prisoners .
we have a lot of time to make the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have &quot; the &quot; s &quot; , &quot; the people who are getting behind the grid , for a more , for a car , for the theft of good , rather than that you force them to give back the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a more powerful , not less .
and i think our current way of doing no help .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
so , you &apos;ve got a string of it here , you &apos;ve got a string of string .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
bin laden is a growing percent of the day .
famine in somalia . three : spray of police spray .
four : more educated , five : dangerous , dangerous .
six : social degradation . seven : 65 dead .
eight : six : nine .
different speakers . mass weapons .
recession . a standstill . egypt . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could be the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative topics because our minds are exactly giving attention to these issues .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second every day , our senses will catch much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first stop for all the information is a part of our temporal lobes , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early team , our main team .
it &apos;s a report and the whole information that &apos;s going to look for all the information on the quest of the threat of the environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage , when it &apos;s going to be a , is very true , the demand is very true .
now , with all our digital devices that we have seven days a week , 24 hours a day , all these negative news is not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is always worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
perhaps the vast progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century is made by a series of forces that are so strong that it &apos;s possible to create us in the next three decades , a world of abundance .
now , i &apos;m not saying that we don &apos;t have a big problem -- climate crisis , water , water and energy systems -- we &apos;ve already got .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at that , and they &apos;re actually going to be able to get into a very long way , but they eventually get to overcome .
so let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , which has tripled inflation in inflation .
child mortality has reduced to a tenth of child mortality .
and that &apos;s the fact that the most important , more cosmopolitan , and communication costs have reduced to a pair of light .
steve pinker showed us that we currently live in a very peaceful time of the world &apos;s life .
and according to charles agus , the most prolific in the last 130 years is up to 80 percent of the year .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations constantly .
in fact , we have new poverty .
think of that a big percentage of americans who live under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , tv , mobile phones , and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the world &apos;s most popular , would never have been able to dream such luxury goods .
the basis of a lot of it is technologies , and these are growing up .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that is going to be on information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , is a big leap , and the most 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less and less than a supercomputer , and it &apos;s a supercomputer faster than a supercomputer .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , how smooth you is -- in good times , war or peace , recession , depression , depression and the food .
this is the result of faster computers , the faster computers building .
it &apos;s slowed down for none of our big problems .
and despite your logarithmic , despite your logarithmic side , you &apos;re going up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to all of them .
&quot; the &quot; aw &quot; , something that my friends call in autodesk , sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers , that allow the personal production to democratize our planet , synthetic biology , fuel , and food , digital medicine , and the artificial intelligence ,
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm supercomputer watson ?
that was great .
i &apos;ve been looking for newspapers and looking for the best headlines that i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson &apos;s human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that these artificial intelligence would have been available to each owner of a single country .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i started to see a new university , which is &quot; singularity university &quot; called &quot; singularity university . &quot;
we bring our students all these technologies to the very specific focus of how they can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students to create companies , products and services that can affect a decade of billions of people .
think about that , a group of students today can affect the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
today we can refer to dozens of companies that have done this .
if i think of making abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating a lot of goods .
scarcity is a lot of the time , and technology is a resource of a resource .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of sunscreen in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of the king of the house .
and the soldiers were getting a lot of the time , bullying themselves , and they got a riot .
but the king of the king of the street got a lot of time .
aluminum was at this time that the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and platinum .
this is why the dome was made of aluminum from aluminum .
although aluminum tapestries are going to be the most important percent of the world &apos;s population , it &apos;s not as pure metal .
it &apos;s connected through oxygen and water .
but then the technology of the world &apos;s technology was developed and made it so cheap that we use it with our own energy system .
then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we think about the most of the time .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet of the world &apos;s worth of energy , and we &apos;re using more energy than we use a year .
16 hundred of the energy &apos;s energy is all published in the surface of the earth .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve been able to reduce the cost of solar energy in india to 50 percent of the average of the world &apos;s disease -- the silver rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy was over 50 percent .
last month , this has published a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the united states , solar energy is going to be six cents per capita , compared to 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have an energy energy , we will have water in the abundance .
let &apos;s talk about the world &apos;s rights .
remember , as carl sagan , the most than carl sagan , when it was on saturn , was back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it ?
&quot; a &quot; blue blue australian . &quot;
because we live on a computer table .
we live on a planet that is covered by 70 percent of water .
yes , it &apos;s a percent of the water bottle , two percent are more sinister , and we &apos;re fighting to 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new organizational technology on the way , the way it &apos;s .
and from a conversation today with dean ornish , one of the innovators of doing it , i want to share with you something -- he gave me permission -- his permission , the &quot; the &quot; s &quot; , which is called &quot; the &quot; s &quot; and
it can produce a thousand liters of clean water per day -- whether saline , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents per liter .
the president of coca-cola has just been a big , big school system to start a hundred units in developing countries .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola will apply this technology globally in the entire planet .
this is a little innovation that &apos;s now available .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
you mean , my goodness , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 2013 .
just consider that a computer cell with a mobile phone in the middle of kenya has a better health rate than president reagan 25 years ago .
and if you look for your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowing and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the abundance of how nobody ever could have predict .
and it &apos;s even better , the things that you &apos;ve spent and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , and photo , libraries and photo , libraries of books and music , technology to medical imaging -- now , literally , in your cell phone .
and the best thing about this is perhaps what we expect in health .
last month , i had the pleasure of the pleasure of the &quot; $ 10 million million million people &apos; prize prize &quot; $ 10 million million prize prize .
we &apos;re asking teams all over the world , all these technologies in a mobile phone that can be connected to the device , because it &apos;s equipped with ai , because it &apos;s equipped with ai , you can test it or test your color .
and to win , the device has to be a better diagnosis than a team of physicians .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there is no doctors , but 25 percent of the people &apos;s health care and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
if this device sequenced a little bit or a more threatening , it &apos;s not known to the insurance rate , and it &apos;s going to stop a pandemic before you have a pandemic .
but now , the biggest force that leads us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the world &apos;s population .
and by the way , the biggest most powerful against a population population is a better education and nutrition in the world .
in 2010 , we had just been connected to two billion people online .
until 2020 , we increase a ride from two billion internet users .
three billion new heads that we never heard before , will be the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what will they want ?
and instead of ecological gridlock , i see one of the largest economic systems of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that are going to flow into global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier by using the use of healthier , and they &apos;re trained by the most sophisticated , and they &apos;re going to be able to use the possibility of 3d printers and &quot; the &quot; more productive computing , &quot; and so much
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated members of the world &apos;s population are bringing us ?
as it would be with a sentence , never before , ever before .
how about it , the oppressed , where they &apos;re , to give a voice to pay attention to the very first time , and to make change , for the first time ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
how about the brain that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i learned from the x prize is that small teams that are motivated by passion and focus are extraordinary things , things that could only create the great companies and governments in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might know .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
it was developed in the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to evolve .
and the way we can predict the structure is to predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the most important .
so far , this was a supercomputer for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university professors .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online .
and it turns out that today the human pattern recognition pattern is better than the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked at who &apos;s the best of the world &apos;s best , this was not a very clear , no more a , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was working in the day , and the best
ladies and gentlemen , what &apos;s enormous trust in our future is that we have more power than individuals to make us think of the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a computer .
we have the capital of the internet .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work online to master the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s needed .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something about a piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical medical and i &apos;m .
and maybe i &apos;m a long enough time in business than i can give it to me a piece of my own wrong to give this to you .
but before i &apos;m going to talk to the actual issue of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re the middle of the world &apos;s world , and we move to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; the &quot; s &quot; seems soon and it turns around statistics and to use this great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to get to a statistics that i hope that most of you have heard of .
it &apos;s the most popular of the design .
we talk about a 300 , if a bat beat 300 .
that means that the player is safe to beat three of 10 beats .
this is the ball of the ball , and he &apos;s going to go , he &apos;s not caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball to the first base , it didn &apos;t have done it in time and the cover was in safety .
three out of 10 .
do you know how to call a car &apos;s license in baseball &apos;s baseball baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a more powerful .
you know how to call a laser test ?
this is somebody who &apos;s safe to be four out of 10 .
so , as ted williams -- the last ted league of baseball -- the last year of baseball , the last year of a regular season , was met over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , which i feel about a lot more comfortable or maybe a little less likely to do with you .
imagine a computer company , and you &apos;re going to be blogging to a computer company , which is 400 in terms of the car , which is 400 in terms of a car .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine life in a certain remote area and you have a beloved people with clogged steel and their favorite , and their favorite of the water , which is a little bit of a time , which is the most prolific in the street .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better . it &apos;s on the board branch .
and she &apos;s going to blow up a laser .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the most like the most important for a car or a nurse or a nurse or a nurse , a computer company , should be a viable , a car company ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody knows in the entire medicine , which should be a good surgeon or a doctor or a doctor .
but what we do is we &apos;re in each of them , including me , in the world , to be perfect .
never make a mistake , no one does it , but the details of the details of how this should be done .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was a lesbian student .
in high school , a school school said that brian was learning for a blood test .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little little school class in the sisters in the toronto , general hospital , of here .
i learned everything .
in my favorite , i learned the origins and the tail every single stick of every stick , every branch of a artery , which is from the aorta , obscure and ordinary .
i even knew the most popular about the most cosmopolitan of the world &apos;s brain .
and i &apos;ve got more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i was going to tear up with a little bit of the time .
and i left medical school with the impression that i knew if i knew everything and knew everything , or at least as much as possible , as close as possible , i was immune to make mistakes .
and it worked for a time until i met a woman printer .
i &apos;m going to put in a school school here in toronto as a woman &apos;s printer in the hospital of the hospital .
at that point , i was the most troubled layer in the prison service .
and it was my mission when the most popular advice was looking at the most important thing to study .
and feedback to my favorite system .
i studied ms. printer , and she was in the street .
and when i listened to her , she made sound sounds .
and when i was using her chest with the most prolific , i could hear a sound of sound on both sides that said to me that she was suffering under the heart failure .
this is a state in which the heart is failing , rather than pump the entire blood on the lung , and it &apos;s a part of the blood cells in the lung , and it &apos;s filling up that , so the most sophisticated thing came out .
and that was not hard to diagnose .
i put them and made me care about the treatment .
i gave her a demonstration . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call the water , water pills , so that they &apos;re going to be the liquid .
and over a period of a year , one to two hours , she started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
i actually made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my favorite .
i didn &apos;t take the catch up and i did what i should have been , what would have been a call in my favorite , so that he had a chance to make a chance of making a sense of a picture .
and he knew it , he would have been able to get more information to her .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the most honest doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility that i was so much and so i would be able to make my patients to come back without having to contact it .
my second mistake was worse .
and that &apos;s what i sent to you home , i &apos;m a quiet voice in my , trying to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . do not do that . &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s been very popular to me that i asked the nurse , which was the nurse that was taking care of woman , &quot; do you believe it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and he said in a way , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to be good . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
so i cut the most selective and an ambulance and a ambulance and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this nagging feeling in my stomach .
but i continued to work .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my things , and i went to the hospital , and i went to the parking parking room to drive home with the car , when i did something that i didn &apos;t do .
i went home through the street , and i went home .
and there was another nurse who said , not the sister who had seen the woman &apos;s printer , but another three words to me and that three words are afraid that most of the most popular ones i know .
other medical doctors fear this as well , but the environmental care is very special because we just see the patient so that we &apos;re going to see the patient .
the three words loud : remember ?
&quot; remember the patient you &apos;d send home ? &quot;
asked the nurse , the nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular kind of state .
so she was back .
she was back and dying .
about one hour after that she got home , after i sent her home , she collapsed and the family called 911 . the most popular they brought back to the top of the 50 , which is a dangerous , dangerous thing .
they barely breathe and was blue .
the most sophisticated thing was all the strands .
they gave her their credit .
they closed them on the top of the road .
i was shocked and to the inside of the inner .
and i was running through this rollercoaster because they came to the intensive care care system , and i hoped they would recover .
and after two , three days , it was clear that she would never again be awakening again .
she didn &apos;t have a more pessimistic child .
their family started to put themselves .
and in the course of the next eight or nine days , they led to the most of the time .
the day , they go to the day -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say that you &apos;re never hearing the names of the world &apos;s names .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
the next weeks i made myself , and i learned to myself the first time myself , the unhealthy shame , which exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isolated , not the way of healthy shame that you feel because you can &apos;t talk about
you know all the healthy shame , if you give a secret of the best friend , although this one on the top of a car &apos;s and you get caught and the best friend is going to be able to do it , and you &apos;re going to
if you do it , and you never do the mistakes again .
this is the kind of plastic of shame shame .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is that it &apos;s a very difficult thing to do in the heart .
it &apos;s the one that says that it &apos;s not what you did , but you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t for my favorite , he was very happy .
he spoke with the family and i &apos;m sure he &apos;s got the medicines and i &apos;m sure that i wouldn &apos;t be sued .
but i asked myself to ask these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the most important ? why would i send them home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a dumb mistake ?
why went to medicine ?
but slowly , it would be safe .
i started feeling better .
and then on a day of a day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke up and i might say i could feel better again .
and i was with me that if i doubled my efforts to perfection and never again , a mistake that the voice could be made .
and she did it .
and i continued to work .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the prison hospital in a hospital hospital in a hospital hospital north of toronto , and i was a 25 year-old man with a young man &apos;s day .
it was a lot of time and i in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked at the most popular and it was a little bit pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and yet , when he went out of the door , he showed up his shoulder .
two days later , i came to my next ted project and my favorite door asked me to speak in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the patient &apos;s office ? &quot;
it turns out he was a computer company .
he had potentially a potentially potentially disease disease called the &quot; rescue . &quot;
you can google , but it &apos;s not infection of the most prolific , but the top of the top , and causes the open of the heat .
and fortunately , he died .
he got a little bit of a time , and he recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same kind of honor of shame and self-doubt , and i felt free to work and went back to work until it was again and again .
in a corporate fashion , i have two times a double test .
there &apos;s a lot of this , especially if you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital that has only 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no substitute in their treatment .
i thought he had a lot of time .
i &apos;m going to put the x-ray on the kidney , and when it was without a throwaway , my colleague was stuck in the front of the patient &apos;s rights , and called the surgeons in the lower right sector .
the other had strong diarrhea .
i &apos;m going to go to the street to get him to the head of mine and asked my colleagues to be able to test him .
and he did and he was in the right , and he was in the right the bottom of the sector , called the surgeons .
in both cases , it was a lot of time , and it was good .
both cases of mine , i &apos;m on my own .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues , but it &apos;s total nonsense .
some of my favorite projects happened in the last five years .
alone , it &apos;s embarrassed and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t end with my mistakes and talk about them , if i can &apos;t get the quiet voice , what &apos;s really happened to me , what &apos;s really happening to my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes , so that they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i was in a room -- like now , i don &apos;t know what you think about me .
when did you hear the last time of someone who &apos;s talked about the most of the time of the world &apos;s worth of energy ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you may hear about any other doctor , but you don &apos;t hear somebody talking about your own mistakes .
if i had a full of colleagues with colleagues and asking their immediate support , and they started telling them what i &apos;m telling you , i would probably not get the end of the second story before it really would be uncomfortable , and they would be able
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues , that a computer company would have lost the wrong leg in my hospital , then you believe i would have trouble to look at the eyes .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system that is two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do . those who are driving sleep and the sleep that &apos;s with bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response as antibodies , which attack a human being .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we &apos;re the ones who are making mistakes from medicine , we &apos;re going to be a secure system .
but there are two problems in this .
in my about 20 years of medical school and journalism , i have a personal medical study on medical mistakes and false treatments to make all of me possible for a first article that i wrote for the toronto star , black art , black art , black .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely valid .
we &apos;re working in a system that &apos;s going to happen every day in which one of 10 more or a half is either a false or wrong , and the more and more of the way that they &apos;re going to do is cause the loss and the
in this state , about 24,000 canadians die of the disease .
in the united states , the institute of medicine took the number of 100,000 .
both of these are strong , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as well as we should .
and is the most important thing .
in a corporate field that the medical knowledge is doubling all two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
sleep is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error , so we can take a perfect track of a patient with an airplane with pain .
then i take the same patient with the same patient , making it , and give it a little bit of a breath and give it a slightly more lightweight breath to do it and suddenly , and suddenly the story is saturated with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same way .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms always in the same way .
all of this is inevitable .
so if you take the system like i was taught , and all the most sophisticated things that are edited out , then no one &apos;s left .
and you know the most popular about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , white , black art , i have the habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everybody from the most of the time to the ted system , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah
and then their horizons expand , they &apos;re just coming down the head , and they &apos;re going to look down and they &apos;re hard to tell them , and they &apos;re going to start telling their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes that i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what you need is a environment that you can put in the situation .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new doctor is a human being , knows about his humanity , accepted , not proud of making mistakes , but it &apos;s all about learning to learn about it so that it can be passed .
they share their experiences with other people .
they support when they &apos;re talking about their mistakes .
and it shows other people &apos;s mistakes , not to be more inclusive , but in a loving , supportive way of all of these benefits .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life and when that is , then people are also making mistakes of time .
so that the system is going to be developed to create the same thing that makes it easier to find mistakes , and it makes people feel like , and they also make a good job to create spaces where everybody who &apos;s watching health care , which is
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the new doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i &apos;m making mistakes .
but i &apos;ve been filming , but i &apos;m trying to learn best from it to give it to others .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding from me , but i can live with it .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about the most cosmopolitan .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories about the time to use the time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was in 1835 .
you might think he &apos;s carrying out the piano , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he collected fish .
he described one of them as a very common .
it was a computer company .
and in the &apos; 80s , it was found in great style .
now he &apos;s listed on the red list of species .
and this story we heard many times from the galapagos or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the most popular is still as pristine as the pristine .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is to make another concept that &apos;s the most important thing to do , to show .
because i experienced it when i was in 1971 a lagoon in a nazi cafe .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad blast , and i was convinced that i really wasn &apos;t there .
it was my first edible .
as you see , the lagoon was from palms and some of the trees of the trees .
there was a little bit of a subset of about 20 inches , and there was a subset of the world &apos;s population .
the fisheries of these twin systems were very productive and the fishermen lived well and made it in ghana above the average .
when i returned to 27 years later , the fish was blown up half of his size .
adult measurements are five centimeters .
they were genetically modified .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had happiness , too .
so it doesn &apos;t change anything , and yet it &apos;s changed everything .
my third little story talks about my favorite story of the most important of the world in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- more early at the beginning of the 1960s -- the united states .
and the other thing that countries did was , they were starting to have a hundred fish , which is called the industrial fishing of this fairly ugly ship .
i went to this and we did the census of the entire southern sea of ocean , and especially in the most remote .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know that it was the reason of the ocean .
90 percent of our favorite were sponges , other animals , who are connected to the reason .
the largest part of the fish , the small dots there on the rubble , the most cosmopolitan , were the most powerful .
basically , the bottom of the ocean came back and then thrown back .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you run an survey and then starts with the commercial fishing .
the reason is it changes . from -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft coral is going to be a crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we started a living life .
she wasn &apos;t drowning .
then they wanted to kill them because they could eat it well .
in fact , this mountain is actually planted from the rubble every time you go to areas , where you &apos;re going to be in areas that never have been fish .
it &apos;s not going to be documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we &apos;re going to fit our online level of the new level and call us not in memory , which was there .
if you &apos;re going to do it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis , some good things are : biodiversity , number of the world &apos;s green , the green of your country , the green .
it &apos;s changing . it changes , because for people , they are very , of course , their actions .
every generation of the images that you &apos;re looking at at the beginning of your conscious life is as a standard and it &apos;s going to get everything out of it .
the difference is then seen as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can give you a order of changes .
and at the end , they just want to get the most sophisticated remains .
that &apos;s largely our goal .
we want to get things that are gone or things that are not like that , as they were .
you could think that the problem was people who certainly were living in the world , and they were killing animals , and they were only aware of a few generations , which they had done .
because obviously , an animal that was very often , just once , before it &apos;s a lot of time , before it &apos;s going to be a little bit more .
so you don &apos;t lose a lot of the natural animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not being seen as a big loss .
and we &apos;re focusing on the big animals , and in the ocean , the big fish are the big fish .
they &apos;re getting less rare because we &apos;re catching them .
and the time is a little bit of fish left , and we think that &apos;s the most important thing .
the question is , why people accept this .
well , because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
they &apos;re going to confirm it because the evidence , as you can in a previous form , are not like you would like to describe the evidence .
for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of a computer report , which is a big amount of view of this area , can &apos;t be used , or not , or not , because it &apos;s not a scientific , because it &apos;s not &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in educated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous big role that can play a marine reserve .
because in marine marine field , we basically put the past back .
we &apos;re going to ask the past that people can &apos;t understand because the most important thing is , and very low .
so , people who see a marine reserve and the ones that are going to benefit from the view that allows you to reset their own value .
what about the people who don &apos;t have that possible because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the middle west for example ?
here , i think , i think , the art and the film may fill the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was a lot of time -- 500 years ago .
and the most popular and the most popular , you might remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think of &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were touched by this -- except from the most important , why were they so touched by the most important ?
because it &apos;s something that has been lost in a way that &apos;s lost in a way .
so my only one , the only one i &apos;m going to give , is to be a cameron ii , so he &apos;s going to spin &quot; avatar ii &quot; under water .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist , you had to , if you had a typewriter , that in the government .
they also had to put a sheet of glass out of this typewriter .
the reason for that : the government could track where a text came from .
and they found a paper with a little bit of the idea of the idea of the idea of finding the creator of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do something like this , and how much the speech would be being replaced .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
but if you buy a new computer project today in 2011 , and print a page , then this page has light yellow on every page , in a pattern that makes the page clear on you and your printer , which makes the site clear on you and
this is what happens today .
and nobody seems to be a lot of time .
and that was an example of what our own governments are doing to us , the citizens , the citizens , use .
and this is one of the three main elements of the existing world today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three main projects .
there are superstar problems .
for example , this is mr. &apos;s favorite , and this is a gentleman &apos;s favorite of the prison in ukraine .
and the motives of the brain are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use the water to make a lot of money , a huge pile of money .
there are several known cases of the world &apos;s worth of oil , which is the money that you have made of attacks .
this is a little bit of a laser designer from northern europe in estonia .
this is alfred &apos;s bell .
stephen watt .
so , the math system .
these are matthew anderson , and so on and so on and so on .
these people have come online to wealth , but they &apos;ve acquired it illegal by using the child &apos;s water , for example , to get money from our bank , while we do our online online system , or we &apos;re going to go to a computer system
the u.s. intelligence agency two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam harbor , and on this account , were a shortage of potassium million dollars , when it was frozen .
mr. gordon himself is on free feet , the shocker is unknown .
and i &apos;m saying that today , it &apos;s more likely to be victims of a human being as a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be worse .
in the future , most crimes are going to play online .
the second largest largest world we can see today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , a sense , or by their audience .
groups like anonymous are moved over the last 12 months , and they have become one of the most prolific ones on the field of the field of the world .
so these are the three main points : criminals , who are doing it for money , like anonymous , which is how anonymous , but the last group are nations , governments , the attacks of attacks .
there are cases of the way that we &apos;re going to be .
it shows a great idea of what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
and the netherlands is a very , very popular one from the netherlands -- or it was .
the last fall , it had to sign up , because it was hacked .
somebody was hacked and had a system to be hacked .
and last week in a meeting with dutch , i asked one of the senior people who asked the question whether he could have been able to get it for possible , because of the most powerful people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how do people die in a remote such ?
so , the math is a computer game .
they sell the food .
what do you do with the water ?
now , a certificate , you need a website with a computer camera , with a little bit of service , for example , to build kerosene .
now we all use , or many of us , or a lot of us , and these services are particularly common in the states , and these services are particularly common in the states like iran , where the people are using the other , and they can
but you can do it if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign .
and it &apos;s a fake hacking system , and fake the fake .
and that &apos;s what happens in the case of the brain .
how about the arab spring and the things that are happening in egypt ?
now , in egypt , the insurgent headquarters in april 2011 , the headquarters of egyptian , the egyptian headquarters , found a lot of records .
in these records , a folder was called &quot; the &quot; aw . &quot;
and in this folder , notes were a local company , which was the egyptian government sold a few programs that they had -- in very large frame -- all of communication of egyptian citizens could capture .
they had sold this program for humberto euros to the egyptian government .
the most important thing is right here .
so western governments are providing governments to do with their own citizens , so that they can do their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , a few weeks ago , the so-called two weeks ago , that was a tomato sauce , which was used by german , to be used to their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be in a corporate plant , you &apos;re going to be pretty much safety , your phone is going to be a little bit of the security .
but today we are far beyond that .
they tap their internet connection .
they use tools like the most cosmopolitan to put their computer with a tomato tomato system that allows them to monitor their entire communication , their own , their forefathers , to collect their forefathers .
so if we think about these things , the obvious answer of people would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a good citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i don &apos;t hide anything . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we now , in 2011 , our governments like trust , is , in fact , every right we &apos;re going to give up forever .
and we trust , trust , we &apos;re blind to each future government , a government that we may have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to deal with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the ted .
the first time , the first time , the first time , was made , and the first idea of a simple idea : modules from cement with a given set of things that fit .
so , the most quickly fast , the most quickly , the most quickly the most powerful .
they put us in the position to build things bigger than we , buildings , bridges , a stone after the other .
essentially , the most important thing was the building block of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of this .
it &apos;s called &quot; automatically scientifically rock . &quot;
and within a few years , lego moved into every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for all .
lego basically has the most powerful , the building building of the world , and it made a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the same year , the next revolution was announced the next revolution , the next building building .
the transistor was a little bit of a little bit of a sudden that was static to us from a world of static , and it was all interactive to a world in which it was interactive .
as the most important , we allow the transistor to build much more complex , more complex , a stone after the other .
but there &apos;s a key one : the transistor was only for experts .
i personally accept that that the building block of our time is for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab and i started exploring this idea of how to make the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing the research .
let me show you how they work .
so , the electronic modules are electronic modules that have specific function .
they &apos;re a little bit of the light , light , clay , engine and sensor .
and the best thing about it is that they connect with magnets .
so they can &apos;t put them wrong .
the stones are the ones .
green is a copy , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is wires .
so everything you need to do is connect a blue and a green one , and you can build very quickly more quickly .
they add a blue one on a green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch between it and you put a little bit of a little bit of a light .
take the switch out to a light , which is here , and you &apos;ve made a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a sudden .
add this kind of thing to a extra effect , and they &apos;ve made a more powerful thing .
i &apos;ll stop that .
and beyond the simple play , it &apos;s actually quite powerful .
instead of programming , you have to program , or you have to do it , you have to program your simple , intuitive gestures .
so to accelerate the physical arm , or slow down , just turn it on this button and it makes the momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind the world is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world in a rock .
lights , sound , sound , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve spread out of children , and they &apos;re looking at it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how do you start to understand the electronics that you &apos;re in the everyday world and you don &apos;t learn in school .
like a design of a design , or why the doors of the mountain &apos;s doors , or how a ipod responds to touch .
we also brought up the food system .
so , for example , we had designers with no experience in electronic things that started playing with the material as a material .
here we see , with a paper , paper and water bottles , like the water .
a few weeks ago , we took a risd trip to risd , and we gave them some designers that had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; do what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a more powerful thing .
but wait , this is really my favorite story .
it &apos;s a hummer from play-doh , the fear of the darkness .
for those of you , the other material was a more material , electronics was just another material .
and we want to make this material available for all available .
so , it &apos;s open source source .
you can go to the website , all the main prints , and you make yourself .
we want the world of creators , the inventor , the contributors , because this world , in which we live , this interactive world , is us .
so , pull out and start to invent them .
thank you .
