you know , one of the great things in the travel and one of the pleasures in the world &apos;s research is to live with people who remember the old days , which is still the old days of the space , and they &apos;re laughing at the rain ,
just knowing that the fact that the way that we &apos;re going to travel beyond the milky way or the meaning of the oldest of the inuit is still meaning , or that the himalayas is still the breath of the most of the human being , which is the
and of course , we all share the same .
we &apos;re born all . we &apos;re going to bring kids to the world .
we go through the street .
we have to deal with the tncs &apos;s unthinkable separation , and so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , dancing and art .
but interesting is the unique worldview of the most powerful , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s about the u.s. development in the woods of borneo , or the warrior in haiti , or the warrior in the northern ridge , the warrior , in the balcony , or a little bit of the middle of the sahara , and
all of these people teach us that it &apos;s other people &apos;s other ways , other ways of thinking about the earth , other ways of guidance .
and this is a notion that , if you think about it , a mere hope can fulfill hope .
together , the myriad cultures in the world are a net of plastic and cultural lives that the earth is going to be , and for the earth , as well as the biological power system , that you know as the biosphere .
you can imagine this cultural design model as a computer designer , and the most powerful thing is that the most interesting thing about the mind and dreams , myths , and myths , are being created by the human imagination , defined by the beginning of consciousness .
the most amazing legacy is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and what we &apos;re capable of as amazing as the species that we are doing .
and as the biosphere was slaughtered , this was happening with the most abundant -- just more than more speed .
no biologist would say to say that 50 percent or more of all species are just about extinction , because it &apos;s simply not true , and yet , this -- the most important thing to do is , the most important thing to do on the field of cultural
and the key of the declaration is extinction .
when everybody was born in this room , there were 6,000 languages spoken on earth .
now , a language is not just the sum of the vocabulary or a series of internet parts .
a language is expression of human mind .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a particular culture will find access to the tangible world .
every language is like a forest forest of the mind , a turning point , a thought , a ecosystem of spiritual possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages today , as we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , the half of them don &apos;t have to be more in the ears of children .
they &apos;re not taught to be taught to live the infants , which means that if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely than being the silent , one of the last of your people to be talking to your language , not having any way to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or to expect the hope of the other kids ?
and yet , this horrible destiny actually comes to someone somewhere on earth , about all two weeks , because all of weeks , dies , dies , an elderly and taking the last resting in a old language with a grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; it &apos;s not better ? &quot; if the world is not a better place , if we &apos;re all going to talk to a language ? and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be a job , let &apos;s
let &apos;s be kogi . &quot;
and then suddenly , you would see how it would be if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so i want to take you in a way of thinking about the most interesting trip , a short journey through the computer , to try to make you realize what &apos;s actually lost .
now there are some of us who sort of forget that i say , &quot; different possibilities of his being , &quot; really different possibilities of his life .
for example , take this kid &apos;s child &apos;s child &apos;s child , the the amazon of the amazon , the people of the world &apos;s belly , believe that they &apos;re going to be the most prolific of the east in the belly of saint snakes .
this is a people who don &apos;t separate cognitively between the colors blue and green , because the most powerful thing that people are dependent on is , they &apos;re dependent on .
you have a curious language and a more sophisticated one that &apos;s called the linguistic language , you have to marry somebody who talks to another language .
all of this is ongoing in the mandatory past . the curious to these big houses , which are spoken with the most powerful six or seven languages , but that &apos;s because you &apos;re never talking to anyone who learns a language .
you just listen to it and then you start talking .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the most amazing in the northeast of ecuador , is an amazing people who were first placed in 1958 .
in 1957 , five milligrams were trying to contact and put a little mistake .
they threw out the shots of themselves from the air , which we would be doing as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people from the rainforest were never even seen anything in their life .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , tried to see the face or the character , and they found nothing , and they were killing the five of the things that were the following , and killing the five milligrams with the spear .
but the most successful ones didn &apos;t only go out with the spear .
they &apos;re going to be a different one .
54 percent of the deaths happened by the u.s.
we were tracking the most eight generations , and found two cases of a natural death and when we were with the people with a deceptive thing , they gave them that one of the people had been so old , he was killing him with his foot and he
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
their hunters could smell the urine of 40 steps away and determine what animals of these owned .
in the early days , i got a really amazing task when my professor asked me if i was interested in walking to haiti , and to penetrate the secret societies that were the foundation of the strength of the power and the poison , making sure .
to give you a sense of this big sense , i had to know something about this remarkable belief of the most remarkable belief , and voodoo is not a cult of the black magic .
in the opposite , it &apos;s a complex kind of worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked them to do the big world , what would they say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , or whatever .
a continent is left , because the guess was that it was in sub-saharan africa not a religious belief . of course there was a little bit of the bottom of the very profound religious thoughts that the tragic diaspora are in the tragic diaspora .
but what a voodoo is so interesting is these living relationships between living and the dead .
the living people give the spirits .
the spirits can be made by the big water , answers to the rhythm of the dance to the heart of the living , so that the most powerful moment for a very short moment is going to be the god .
and the people who like to say the most delicious , &quot; your white white is in the church and you talk about god .
we dance in the temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the mind , you get taken from the mind . how can you be done ?
see this amazing demonstrations : the most amazing , in a corporate scanner , the red coal without combustion , an amazing graph of the ability to influence the body that this is the equivalent of the extreme , when it &apos;s being delivered into a state of extreme arousal
now , from all people i met , the kogi of the sierra nevada de nevada in the sierra nevada city of santa &apos;s , most extraordinary .
offspring who were the old school of civilization , the caribbean of columbia , went across the caribbean , and the result of the 1990s was a massive set of light , which is the most abundant , which is that the west coast of the coastal ocean is available
in a museum museum , these people were the only ones who were never previously conquered from the most of the people .
until today , you will be represented by a ritual priesthood , and the education is very extraordinary to the priesthood though .
the young people are separated in the age of three and four years of their families and in a world of darkness , in the front of the glacier for 18 years , and two periods of time , they &apos;re being elected to the end of the great mother
and during that whole time , they &apos;re actually being developed culturally in the values of their society , values that sustain the claim that their prayers and their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could say that ecological -- balance .
at the end of this amazing ted , you &apos;ll suddenly get out of one day and for the first time in your life , in age 18 , you see a sunrise , and in this particular moment of consciousness , the sun &apos;s going to be the most
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is going to be very important .
whenever we think of native and landscape , we either have a little bit more sophisticated and old , and the old kind of the fancy wild , which is a very , very difficult thought , or the other , and say , these people are more connected to
so , native , not sentimental , no warps , you &apos;re going to get out of the nostalgia .
it &apos;s not much more space in the most walkable of the most walkable of the world &apos;s life or the cold winds of tibet , but yet , they have a mystery of the earth , which is not based on the idea , but it &apos;s a very
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid from the balcony , that is growing up in the belief that the mountain is a heat of a second , which is a very different person , and a different relationship , and a different relationship , is a whole bunch of rocks
if he &apos;s a cauliflower , or a bunch of a little bit of a mind , it &apos;s irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the nature of nature .
i grew up in the woods from british colombia , and believed that these forests are there to be a little bit of the time .
this made me a different person as my friends under the street , who believe that these forests of the tncs , the curved , and the key spirits , are the most prolific spirits , and the most problematic spirits , the most prolific of the world , are
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took in the northwest last april of the amazon .
this is a very popular , by many of you , who have heard the most powerful of your life , from the repertoire of the brain .
what makes it fascinating is not just the most powerful potential of this kind of thing , but it &apos;s actually going to be made of two different sources of the water , and it &apos;s actually made of two different sources of the sources , which is a series
these plant contains some very strong economic systems that serotonin and more accurately are very similar to .
if you &apos;ve seen the most sophisticated , you &apos;ve seen this stuff , which is something that contains it , that substance you &apos;ve made from different species of different species .
this powder is about as much as being traveling from a plastic farm , and it &apos;s a little bit of a time of electricity , and the landing of electricity in a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to make any distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have with my professor , richard evan , who &apos;s the man who &apos;s been able to get the most honest mushroom with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the world , and i suggested that you can &apos;t be able to adopt the impact
but the thing with the most important is that they can &apos;t be taken into the body , because of course they &apos;re in the human gut , of course , of course , the name of the brain is called the &quot; s , &quot; and the name is
you can only connect with some other chemicals that the mao can be brought up .
now , the fascinating thing is that the most powerful , which is in the most sophisticated , is the kind of thing that is necessary to be able to get the power of the information . so ask yourself .
how can these people from a veiled species of 80,000 species of bacteria can &apos;t find these two separate plants that , if they combine these kinds of things , that , if they put together , a kind of a kind of kind of kind of information that &apos;s
we use this great euphemism , trying to figure out what it turns meaningless .
but you ask the indians , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the most prolific , have 17 varieties of information that you see all of the big distance in the forest , which seems to be a kind of way of showing us .
and then you ask them how they put their hands and they say , &quot; i thought you &apos;re understanding some plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you take a number of 17 varieties of wood and you sing them to a different array of neurons .
now , that doesn &apos;t bring you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting .
now the problem is that the problem is that even among us , the sympathy for the difficult situation of native native americans , they look at as a function of the world , but somehow , they &apos;re sort of on the past , but the real world ,
so , the fact is that you remember the 20th century , 300 years of the wars , or technical innovation , but rather than an era where we were in the presence and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth , the problem is not
all cultures have been involved in the dance again with new york .
and the problem is not the technology .
the most prolific is not going to be less on sioux than they were a bow and the arrow of tasks as the americans stopped being as the american and the other thing .
not change and technology , the integrity of the world &apos;s integrity . it &apos;s power . it &apos;s the ugly face of rule .
and wherever you go to the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures are not the doom of the land . these are dynamic living peoples , their existence , from the visible forces , which are going to be able to be able to be able to be
or if we go to tibet , where i &apos;m going to go to the mountains , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the genocide , the most prolific of people , is generally convicted of people , but the most important thing that people of the lives are not being charged is not only not a charged , but generally , and more inclusive than part
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of tibet if you didn &apos;t have a level of airplane .
i traveled to a young colleague of preservation of synchronization in southern kenya , and i was just in southern kenya , and i was seeing the face behind the statistics of those who were actually being determined for the statistics of the people that were being murdered in the
the father of this young man was identified as a followers of the horse lama .
that meant that he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle attacked his holiness in the diaspora , the people after nepal .
his mother was locked up when punishment for -- to be wealthy .
he was being touched in the prison of two years in the prison to hide under her own life , because she couldn &apos;t live without it .
the sister who did this brave was brought into a plastic scanner .
one day , she took a little bit of a time and she had to go to a set of wood for seven years in a tough school workforce .
the suffering of tibet can be disappointed , but the most powerful mind of people is something that is more powerful .
and at the end of the end , we really stand a choice . do we want to live in a world of the world &apos;s population in the world , or in a world of the world ?
margaret libeskind , the great anthropologist said before she died that it &apos;s their greatest fear that while we &apos;re going to a thread , we would see , we &apos;re not just going to move the whole range of human imagination to a more sustainable way , but we
and it &apos;s biased to think that our species may have been there for 600,000 years .
the media revolution that brought us agriculture , and we put us in this moment the cult of the super sacred , the poetry of the priesthood , replaced the hierarchy of the priesthood and hierarchy , specialization and surplus -- found only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is not 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we have all the answers to the challenges that we are standing in the next millennia .
if we ask these things to be human , they &apos;re responding to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to be able to get the opportunity to be able to be able to be a human awareness , which is the importance of the importance that all people and gardens are a space to be able to flourish , and there
here &apos;s a photograph i took at the north of the winter of the world &apos;s kitchen , when i went to the most prolific , and this man , the one , i told you a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the most democratic years of the state of our domination of our domination , they were forced to pull in settlements .
the grandfather of this old man refused .
the family who had the fear of his life took him all the guns and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit don &apos;t have fear of the cold . they used them to their advantage .
the most important of her shoot was originally made of fish that were made in the street community .
the man &apos;s grandfather was not afraid of the arctic night or the ice manager .
he was looking outside , leaving his pants from a plastic farm down and forth in his hand , and when the feces started to transport it , he shaped her in the form of a a sealed .
he &apos;s a little bit of the wind of the pages of the fish and it was completely frozen , and he was a dog with it .
he was projecting the dog and he blew a shack , took the skeleton of the dog and a handbag , put a new dog on the top of the dog and the metal of the cable with the computer bank .
so you can do anything like that .
and this is a symbol for many of the inuit , and all indigenous native the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april in april , the complete control over a field that is bigger than california and texas combined .
it &apos;s our new country , and it &apos;s called the &quot;
it &apos;s an independent area . they &apos;re all controlling the most violent area .
an amazing example , how a nation , a state , the state of the world , can be able to get out of his people .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who are going to be able to know the earth &apos;s distant goals , to realize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they &apos;re the most important of somebody .
they represent parts of human imagination , which go back in past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these kids are going to be part of the best kids of the geography of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we believe that politicians never achieve anything .
we believe that the fact that we think that the math is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world and we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling to the world . our website gets 35 million more than every month .
156 nations sending our food lanes .
our magazines are read from millions .
and we &apos;re a series of trips to the most sophisticated , which we take our audiences to places like such a cultural miracle , that they &apos;re officially blinded by the degree of the world , and hopefully , they &apos;re going to be blinded by the other ,
thank you .
what i &apos;m first going to do is , as quickly as possible , show the basic work , a new technology that we microsoft are as part of a single end of the year , and it &apos;s a environment where you can either run locally or distance with
we see many , many on digital photographs here , which you &apos;re going to be in a rut and the very open-ended , in any way , in a way , new fashion .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look like , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of the library of the library , and it &apos;s in a domain of 300 , and it &apos;s about 300 .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that the performance of a system is like , is the number of web points , the number of web points on your screen in every moment . it has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of the design of the book .
this is a cow house of dickens . each column is a chapter .
to prove that it really is about a text and not a picture , we can do something like that to really show that this one real representation of the design and no image is .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a more , a design .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a very , very important case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a typical section .
and that gives you really the pleasure and the good experience to read a real piece of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with multiple scales .
we also did something about the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we designed a false display with very high resolution that is much higher than a regular ad , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technological carcinogens .
and this really raises these ideas , these limitations for available space on the screen .
we hope that this is not a shy of a convenience and other nonsense -- that should not be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re going to be able to contribute to this area .
but these are all roads in the united states .
the top on the top of the nasa picture of nasa .
let &apos;s take a little bit of it out now .
now , this is live in the internet . you can do it .
this is a project called the name of the name , which is actually two different technologies combined .
one is a very good job , and the other is a very good research about the internet , who &apos;s a college student of washington , under the counseling of steve , at the university of steve .
and rick gibson was doing research in microsoft &apos;s research . a very good collaboration .
so this is live in the internet . it &apos;s driven by the user .
you can see that if we can make these kinds of views , where we can go through images and make these experience of the multiple resolution .
but the spatial orientation of the images is actually meaning .
the key ones have taken these pictures together with it , and they put the real room in which these images that were made near the winter of the world &apos;s land in the canadian mountains , and they &apos;re looking at elements of the images of the slides ,
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are which one that is more touching .
i &apos;d like to show right one of the original data data of noah and that &apos;s from an early prototype of the world &apos;s first time we &apos;ve been working in summer to show you what i think is really the punch line of this technology , which is
we had to worry about the lawyers .
this is a reconstruction of notre dame , who has just stepped in the computer with images of flickr , and they just give wilbur dame in flickr and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the side of the road , and each of
so this is all the way to be more reactive , and they all are in the way in relation to these kinds of things .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i &apos;m going to work at microsoft &apos;s work .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception room here .
and i suspect you can see that this is a lot of different kinds of cameras : everything is about the most important to professional shark engineers , a pretty large number of them that all of them have been in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird ones .
many of you are suspended by faces .
somewhere here , there are some photographs of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster by notre dame , which was recorded right .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point is that we can do things with social environments , and it &apos;s now data from all the collective storage of the whole collective memory , like , visual storage , looking at the earth -- and everything is going to be connected .
all these photos are connected to each other and it creates something that is bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from all the earth .
look at this as the sequel of the work stephen &apos;s day of virtual earth .
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s going to use the complexity with people using it , and use it to the user , and the user is always becoming bigger .
their own photos will be with metadata , which has a different person who has entered another person .
if someone has done the trouble and all of these sacred , and i &apos;ve been announcing who they &apos;re all , then my photo of the waltzes suddenly , suddenly , put on all of these data , and i can start using them to come in in this
and of course , byproduct , all of these are the enormously rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth , which is not just by the most interesting or satellite logic and so on , but through collective memories .
thank you .
do i understand them right ? do i allow their software to be able to be in a particular period of time , in the next few years , all the images that are being used in the world in common ?
yes . they do nothing more than discover .
if you want to make it , they &apos;re making some metaphorical between the images .
and it &apos;s because of the content in the images .
and this is really exciting when you think about the sticks of the information that many of these images have .
as you do a little bit of a design for pictures where you &apos;re following sentences and the text of the website contains a lot of information about that , which is the picture .
but how would it be if the picture is linked to all their images ?
then the amount of search is the amount of search and the abundance that makes it really enormous , it &apos;s a classic classic .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , how i hope , in mixing with other things you &apos;ve heard , and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections , if you don &apos;t notice that .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official &quot; of the &quot; hate . &quot;
the official thing about what ?
the official , the official , of all western industrialized societies .
the official model of the official works is when our goal is to maximize the common public &apos;s goal , all of this is due to the freedom of freedom of the individual .
the reason that is that freedom is good in itself , valuable , meaningful , a basic assumption for human .
if people have freedom , everyone from us to do things for themselves is to do things that our public value and nobody has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common they have .
this is , i think , deep in our water supply that doesn &apos;t come to the point of mind .
and it &apos;s also rooted in our lives too .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what we can do modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say something about the news of the day .
there are five times a second of the time in my supermarket when you don &apos;t get the 10 extra extra extra gas lines and put 12 of them to buy the big number of their own of their own life , which is unlikely , that not the tip
so this is how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the business store to put a stereo -- speaker , a child , a radio , radio , radio , skilled , and in this one electronics , there are so many stereo facilities .
we can put together a million different neighborhoods in the entire neighborhoods that are offered to be offered in this one business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas , the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , you could have pulled out every phone , and you wanted to get away from ma bell .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
one episode was that the phone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have a infinite selection of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is the middle -- the middle of the mountain , and the other thing that &apos;s going on , and the other thing that &apos;s going on .
and you should not have seen that until you have seen it in your business , you can be sure that you &apos;ll soon be going .
and what it does is it &apos;s bringing people to do business and ask this question .
now , you know what the answer is to this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life , that &apos;s very significant than buying objects , the same explosion of choice is true .
health care -- it &apos;s not the case in the united states that you &apos;re going to go to a doctor and tell you what to do .
instead , you go to a doctor and the doctor says , we could make b , or we could make b .
a has this benefits and risks .
b has this benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
doctor says a has this benefits and risks and b has the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift of responsibility is a shift for people who know about something -- is a patient &apos;s patient -- which is a patient &apos;s patient --
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like you and me , if you think about it , because we don &apos;t buy it at all , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , you &apos;re going to be on the next morning , and to ask a change of the prescription .
so something so profound as our identity is now a question of choice , how this slide is supposed to show .
we don &apos;t cultivate identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re so often reinventing ourselves as much as we want .
that means that every day , when you wake up tomorrow , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where the most common was that almost every one of them had a , and that &apos;s how they were so married , and then they got so fast as they could .
the only real choice was &quot; who , &quot; not what they did , and not what they did afterwards .
now , all right .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i did before .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and they &apos;re not very carefully carefully carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i get married ?
should i marry later ? should i have kids , or do i do it ? &quot;
they &apos;re all more sophisticated questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions whether that means to make all the tasks i &apos;m going to get to you and not get a good grade in my course .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl reveals , with the technology that allows us to work every minute from every single day on the planet -- to the most prolific hotel .
there &apos;s a corner of that , by the way , from which i &apos;m not going to tell you about the most important thing about the world &apos;s day .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means , this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of work , again and again , and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can watch our children playing football , and we have our mobile phone on one hip , and our blackberry in other hip , and we probably probably have our own lap .
and even if you &apos;re all spinning off , every minute we &apos;re going to ask our child at the dinner of a football party , we should ask ourselves , &quot; should i take this call ?
should i respond to this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; is it going to be very different to your child &apos;s experience of your child &apos;s experience .
wherever we look , big things and small things , material things , and lifestyle , is a question of choice .
and the world we lived out of .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a choice of choice .
and the world we &apos;re living in now is this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to do what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , a way of making it , is that it &apos;s going to penetrate instead of free .
so with so many options you can choose , people will be very hard to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another more example of this , a study about investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to the internet of the internet , the giant plastic of about a million employees , about a million of the jobs .
and what she found was a 10 of the people who offered the employer to get the participation to take two percent .
they offer 50 more of the staff -- 10 percent less staff , when they only offer five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 , which is the choices that are , it &apos;s so hard to decide what to choose to make it tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow never comes .
you know , that &apos;s not just called the people sex , if they &apos;re going to go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to swim , it means that they &apos;re making a lot of difference in their employer .
by not participation , they &apos;re going to be able to get down to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year , who would have been happy to reproduce their contributions .
paralysis is a consequence of too many choices .
and i think it &apos;s going to make it look like this .
they want to make the decision really really , if it &apos;s for all of the eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to pick the wrong investment , or even the wrong thing .
so this is a effect . the other effect is that even if we get to the paralysis and make a decision , we &apos;ll end with less content with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to decide about less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is that it &apos;s about the great choice of different people when they buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is a little bit of a choice , it &apos;s just a different decision to be able to make the decision that
the more possibilities there , the easier it is to regret that is disappointing them to the choice they meet .
second , what economists call the &quot;
dan gilbert did a big point in this morning by telling how much the way we value things , depends on what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternative to think about it , it &apos;s just an attractive properties of alternative , which you &apos;re going to do , and it &apos;s going to be satisfied to the alternative that you &apos;ve chosen to do .
here &apos;s an example . for the one of you who are not new york , i &apos;m sorry .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . you have it all for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; damn &quot; the man &apos;s &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my own neighborhood is gone .
i could park directly from my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the thought that he missed the possibility of the day , day , a great parking lot .
so , the happiness is down the happiness that we get through our choices , even if what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more possibilities that are going to be the choice of the more attractive properties of these choices in the brain .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon is doing some statements .
he &apos;s going to be doing a statement about this in now , and maybe things slow down to do things .
but a more important point that he &apos;s doing is always who you decide to do for one thing , you don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things like a lot of attractive properties , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do less .
third , the expectations of expectations .
this was me , when i was giving my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost the whole time .
and there was a time in that it was just jeans , and they bought them , and they were very bad , they were incredibly provocative and they had been beaten up , and they had been cheating enough , they started to feel &quot; ok . &quot;
so to buy new jeans , to go to a lot of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple of jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the owner said , &quot; do you want to be a benign , easy to get it easy or large ?
do you want buttons or four or four or a crack ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you want to cut down the bottom , you &apos;d like to blah , blah , blah ... &quot; and so on .
my jaw was down and after i recovered , i &apos;d like to have the way that the only way that was the only way .
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour all of this damn the damn jeans , and he threw the business -- and i say the truth -- the best of the best jeans i had ever had .
i had better . all these choices allowed me to have better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it myself .
the reason that i felt bad was to have all these available opportunities , my expectations for what a good pair of jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations when it was just in a kind of way .
when they came in 100 ways , they would be perfectly damn , one of them would have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i had to get , and what i was expecting was , and what i was expecting was , in comparison , what i expected .
so that adds into the lives of people in the lives of people , the expectations of people have been getting the people that are good at how well they will be .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this . because if you would , you would all not know what it is .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is , the past thing was all better than anything worse than anything was worse , was to make it possible for people to have a pleasant surprise .
today , in the world we live -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best for you can hope that you can hope , the things that you might expect is how to be expected .
they &apos;re never going to be comfortable because their expectations , my expectations , are big .
the secret to the main -- that &apos;s what they all come from -- the secret to the ted is low expectations .
i want to say -- a short moment -- i &apos;m married to a woman , and it &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t have a little bit better .
but triple , it &apos;s not always a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of the most bad sitting on a seat party when there &apos;s only one way of buying that when you &apos;re slow , and you ask yourself why , who is responsible , and you ask why , who is responsible ? what can you do
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy one that &apos;s disappointing , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is : it &apos;s .
they could have better to do it .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , if people make decisions , and even if the results of decisions are good , they feel disappointed about themselves .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant -- not the only , but a significant , significant tool of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced the declaration because they &apos;re so high , and then they have to think of these experiences . and then they have to
and so the most important thing is that it &apos;s generally more powerful , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official project that we all think of right now , is completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question , which is better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow , but it doesn &apos;t follow more choices than something .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time , that we &apos;ve been able to make a difference with the value of our value .
now , as a matter of question , i &apos;m almost finished -- as a matter of question , the thing about thinking about this is what all these choices allow in the industrialized societies , is the material of wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them whose problem is not too big .
you &apos;re the problem that you have too little .
so the things that i &apos;m talking about is a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and annoying is : steve milliken has told you yesterday about how these expensive and hard to help the car seats , it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help it .
they &apos;re actually doing hurt .
they &apos;re concerned about that for worse .
if something of what people have allowed our society to make decisions that are made in the world , they wouldn &apos;t just have changed the lives of people , not only the lives of people , but we would be improving .
economists call this a very unfair application .
so , the most important thing is that it &apos;s all going to be better -- not only the poor -- because all these big choices are corrosive to us .
finally , you read this cartoon , and , a sophisticated person , and , you know , a very sophisticated person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know nothing in this particular area . &quot;
old-fashioned imagination , a world &apos;s view of the world -- and that is the way i read it first .
the more i thought about it , the more i came to think that the fish knows something .
because the truth is that if you break the water , so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the street , so that everything is possible , it &apos;s going to get happiness .
they increase the paralysis and down the happiness .
everybody needs a laser test .
this is almost with perfect security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the most important thing about a metaphor is a recipe for misery , and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology and we &apos;re trying to get from digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new lives and build .
we always tried to ask significant questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve digitized almost 20 years . we &apos;ve been sequenced the climate change , and we &apos;ve got a lot of the analog of the analog world of biology to digital world .
now we &apos;re trying to ask whether we can regenerate , or can we make new lives , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , in mycoplasma , which has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we &apos;ve tried whether we can achieve that with another smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it on a hundred genes from the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at these metabolic map , which is very simple , compared to our , trust , it &apos;s simple . but if we all look at these genes , we can take that genes to the other one , it &apos;s very unlikely to have a
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to get out of the front , actually , to actually diffuse the chromosome , to vary the individual components , and put some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we make chromosome more accelerated ?
does it allow the chemistry to make these really big molecules , which hasn &apos;t been done before ?
and , if we can do that , we can start the chromosome ?
one chromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
our steps in the declaration of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code very slowly , but yet , we &apos;re going to start to put it up and then we would put our last point on an exponential curve .
we started to start with 15 years ago .
it actually took some years of starting through a computer review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out that it turns out that it &apos;s very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a more likely process , so the longer you make a piece , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new method with which we could put these little pieces together and the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a little virus of bacteria .
we made small pieces , made a guarantee and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of chemical and put it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles then came from the cells , and then they came back and killed e. e. .
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said they were really working on this model .
they laughed more than they did .
so we think that this is actually a situation in the software , actually , to build your hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go further to the other . we wanted to build a whole set of chromosomes , and it &apos;s more than a little bit of letters , and we thought we &apos;re building it in jars of the virus , which is how we can vary
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information really has to be accurate .
when we first sequenced the genome in 1995 , the most prolific one was a 10,000 base base base .
we found the most powerful thing about the world &apos;s book , if we used the original sequence , and if we used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to make pieces that are 50 letters long and to overlap with other people &apos;s data , to build smaller pieces of information that can fit these fit .
we &apos;ve made unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built it in the built .
think about it : we have a nuclear code : a , c , g and t.
so , the letter of this letter -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids ; there &apos;s a single purpose of each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
initially , we only signed .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we &apos;ve been growing the pieces that we simply could get them up with enzymes , and there &apos;s enzymes that are able to repair these and repair them again .
and we started making pieces , starting with the five to the five , put these together , put these together together to make these together , to make these together , to put together these things .
in every step , we produced these pieces in the surplus , so we could sequence them , because we tried to create a very robust process of what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get the point of the world &apos;s point .
so , this looks like a computer camera .
if we get to these right pieces -- with 100,000 base pairs -- they &apos;re not going to grow in e. , and it &apos;s all the ways of modern molecular biology , and so we &apos;ve been using other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of the design system that was used to repair biology to repair dna that can bring these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s a organism called the most prolific , the three million rads of radiation .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome is just falling apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything has come together like this .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be literally dry , they can even live in the vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life in space can move and move to the search for aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a video of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve used the power of the stuff that we &apos;ve got , and we &apos;ve actually used it to be able to get it together . yeast then adds these together
this is not a regular one , it &apos;s a regular cell .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the most sophisticated .
these are footage of a long period of six seconds .
that &apos;s the publication that we &apos;ve just done recently .
these are about the letters of the letters of the code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with the structure of the structure ever created by people .
it has a video of over 300 million .
if we put it with a nuclear record of 10 and without distances , it would be a little bit of the pages of the pages , just to get this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we turn it up ?
obviously , it &apos;s a very simple thing to do with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier if you &apos;re in the same way that we &apos;re doing it , you just take the nucleus out and there &apos;s another inside , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the clone .
in the field of engineering , it &apos;s the chromosome embedded in the cell , but we &apos;ve just been showing that you can have a complete transplant of a chromosomes from a cell to another , and that &apos;s the activate .
we were conducting the chromosome of a design , and roughly , these two are the very way that people and mice were , we could select some of the most sophisticated things that we could select with this chromosome , and it was very amazing to destroy the whole
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that there is the end , but we tried to get the process to do something .
this is the most popular of evolution here .
we all find species of species here , or a third chromosome , or a third of the two of the things that are in just a second to a species of a species .
so people who think of evolution as a gene is missing a lot of the biology .
there are enzymes called the most nuanced , which actually digest dna .
the chromosome in the cell was not , has no ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve added to .
it was made in the cell , and realized the other chromosome as alien material , and we had only one cell at the end of a new chromosome .
it &apos;s the blue of the genes that we &apos;ve added to the gene .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of species and converted completely into a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we were going to collect .
it may sound like genomic art , but we can do that by moving the world &apos;s business , things quite dramatic .
now i &apos;ve suggested that this is not the most important -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i &apos;ve suggested that we may be able to create a new form of the cambrian explosion that is massive new design systems based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re in the next 40 years of the age of six billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people in the world are in 1946 for each one of the year ; within 40 years , it will be four .
we have problems with food , fresh and safe water , medicine , fuel for $ 6 billion people .
it &apos;s going to offer a challenge for nine .
we need about five billion tons of coal , and we need billions of barrels of water , and that &apos;s a hundred million drums per day .
if we think about biological processes or something that is to replace it , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 that &apos;s going on in the atmosphere .
we &apos;ve now made out of our discoveries of all the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the most important of the future .
the most sophisticated thing had a dozen components and see the diversity of it that came out of it .
we &apos;re first going to enter the limits of the biological reality and the idea of our imagination .
we have technology today because of these fast , fast , to do what we call genetics .
we have now the opportunity to build a big robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine making these 20 million different genes or to optimize these processes to produce inflation or drugs , we can change a little team more molecular molecular biology than the last 20 years science .
and it &apos;s just selection selection . we can go to the power of chemicals , production of chemicals or the water , and so on .
this is a picture of real power that we &apos;re working on , which is actually where you &apos;re going to sit and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to look like it . we know exactly how to look like the genetic code .
we &apos;re now focusing on the fourth generation of the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve recently seen corn ethanol , which is simply a bad experiment .
we have the fuel of the world &apos;s dna and third generation that will be pretty soon , which will be much higher , as inflation or different species of the species .
but , as we think , the only way of doing biology is a big impact without further cost of food or the limitation of their availability , when we see co2 as a way to see co2 , and so we &apos;re working on cells that go to this
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first with the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a way of doing this .
but in our discovery of the world , we all have different ways of different methods .
this is a organism we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about a month , about a month , in almost a small way , in almost a small way .
it uses co2 in methane to use from the use of hydrogen as a source of energy .
we &apos;re looking at whether we can use co2 dioxide , which could be just to be able to put it into the fuel , convert the co2 into fuel , to push this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- the targets of the entire dose of the entire dose of the entire dose industry . right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where else ?
but the same thing is , we &apos;re working on the same process of using the same way for development .
you &apos;ve seen this year with the flu , we &apos;re always a year on the back and you have a dollar , if it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that &apos;s going to change by using the vaccines in the field of food .
this is what the future might look like , with changes , can be accelerated today , and now it &apos;s going to accelerate synthetic bacteria , and perhaps maybe the most prolific .
we &apos;re a light of light people from being human , and our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
and on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised back to you to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far . and for all those who are not there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that was ever addressed -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create conditions that exist less than a second of the universe , and that to 600 million times in a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we take images of these online centers in detectors .
this is what i work on . he &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 feet in the diameter , 22 feet in diameter .
so here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction process that you see .
the 10th year last year , the machine went to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it &apos;s led huge amounts of control in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first ted project which is the whole track of the lhc , and then they &apos;re acting with a part of the lhc , to let a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture at september 10 , we knew that the machine works , what a big triumph is .
i don &apos;t know if this was created the biggest carbon , or this , as someone was visiting google , and the front page was so found .
it means that we get a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires here -- this golden wires here here .
these wires lead to the skin companies when the machine goes on to the ground .
now , the engineers are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , no , they don &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you go down very far , you &apos;ll be able to call it a little bit .
so at minus , at minus , manias , it &apos;s cooler than the space between the stars , can be able to make these wires .
in one of the connections between the internet , between the cracks , there was a plastic center .
and so , it &apos;s a little bit of a heat , and then they have a little bit of experience , and they &apos;re suddenly beginning to do electric resistance .
this was the result .
now , it &apos;s really amazing if you imagine that the magnets weigh over 20 tons of tons and shifted around about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we called them new , they &apos;re called the &quot;
they &apos;re all back to their way back .
and the lhc will be more morally unstable .
we &apos;ll turn it down , and we &apos;re expecting to get the first data in june or july , and we &apos;re going to go on and start to figure out what the building blocks are in order to find out what the building blocks of the universe are
now , of course , in a kind of spark of accidents that the debate of science and engineering on borders are about the value of science , it &apos;s easy to reject something .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to do that , the fact that we &apos;re going to reach beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my latest words of a english scientist , and i &apos;m going to leave you , as i suspect when he &apos;s attacking the most powerful experiments of his life , his apprentice was michael atwood , who is , &quot; nothing is so dangerous
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
books to write is my job , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my great life , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that ever to change .
but the recent thing is , recent things in my life , and my career , that i &apos;ve done to do my relationship with this work completely .
this curious event was that i recently wrote a book -- a biography called the &quot; vagina monologues &quot; , the love of cheese , love , love -- that , in the past , decided to get out of the past books in the world and a big ,
the result is that i don &apos;t get any of where i &apos;m going to get treated , i &apos;m treated .
seriously -- the fall of the fall .
for example , you get to me , and say , &quot; don &apos;t fear that you &apos;re never going to be able to be able to be able to be successful ?
don &apos;t have a fear that they &apos;re going to be able to live all their lives and never create a book that anyone in the world is interested in ? never again ?
okay , that &apos;s really what makes you courage .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was going to talk about 20 years ago when i was a teenager for the first time , that i was the writer of the same kind of reaction .
people said , &quot; do you have no fear of having no success ?
did you have no fear that you kill the humiliation of a letter ?
you don &apos;t worry that you &apos;re going to be able to live your life for your life and never come out and you &apos;ll die on a plane , and you &apos;re going to die on a football plane -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : yes , yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had that .
and i &apos;ve been afraid of a lot more things that nobody would be a clue .
like algae -- and other scary things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it , and i ask myself , why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that by somebody should be afraid that he &apos;s afraid to do the work that he feels ?
and what about the creative enterprise company that they make us insecure about the participation of the brain -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemist and i can remember not a chemist in his 40 years as a chemist , where he was asked to be afraid of being chemists .
with your favorite , john -- how do you do it ?
it just didn &apos;t come , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not been given the reputation of the u.s.
we have a writer , but we &apos;re not just the writers , but not only the writers , but the creative of all the believers , seem to be very mentally powerful .
everything you need to do is look at the bitter , really great head of really great minds from the 20th century , who died young and often died of themselves .
and even the ones who didn &apos;t actually have the most educated , seemed to be really neglected by their talents .
norman ebert : a moment ago he said , he was dying in his last interview : &quot; i &apos;ve killed a little bit more than that . &quot;
a extraordinary statement that you can do about your life &apos;s life .
but we just did not even know if we hear somebody that &apos;s like hearing someone &apos;s way , because we &apos;ve been familiar with this kind of talk for so long . we have a very , very strict notion that creativity and suffering is kind of , of
the question i want to ask today is : is this an idea for you completely ?
feel that ? because with only one centimeter , i &apos;m not feeling like this , i don &apos;t think i &apos;m sure .
i find them tedious .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how it &apos;s taken into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we &apos;re encouraging our big creative lives .
and i definitely know that it &apos;s for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start , to start this dark path of the guess -- especially in which i &apos;m in my career right now .
this is -- look : i &apos;m quite young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i have more than 40 more of the air .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now from the world is going to be the work that &apos;s been held after the most successful book of my last book , right ?
i say it &apos;s a little bit of a friend because we &apos;re all here now , so , all of the friends -- it &apos;s very likely to realize my greatest success behind me is .
oh , jesus , what thought of a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that you can get to the one in the morning to drink a zoo in the morning , and that &apos;s what i don &apos;t want to do .
i would rather keep doing this work , which i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of the most popular , i realize that i can continue to write , to create a kind of a kind of a psychological building .
i somehow have to find a way to write a very low distance between me and my very natural process of how the reaction will be on the writing .
while i &apos;ve been looking for models for the last year , i &apos;ve been looking for the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if you might have better or more or more of the ideas to see , to deal with the emotional
this is a quest to take me into the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will end up again .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of induction , which was made from a distant , unknown source of people -- from a very distant , unknown reason .
the greeks called this divine , super relaxing of creativity , of creativity .
and by socrates , he was known to believe he had a dog that he knew about , which he made a lot of time .
the roman had the same idea , called the kind of , kind of , a kind of creative spirit of a creative genius .
this is great . the roman didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical creature , which was believed that it was literally in the walls of a football system -- like the kind of research of the web , the most powerful , the most profound and the artist &apos;s work would be
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s this , because it &apos;s the distance i talked about -- the psychological construction building you protect from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked like this , right ?
the artist &apos;s artist was protected in certain things , like , for example , too much , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at everything for you , everybody knew you had this kind of genius genius that helped you .
if your work is going to work -- not completely your fault , right ?
everybody knew your genius was paralyzed .
so the people in the west really have been thinking about creativity .
and then the renaissance came and everything changed . we had these big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- about all gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no space for the mystic creatures that
it &apos;s the beginning of rational bombay and people started to believe that creativity has completely come from their individual individual .
for the first time in history , people are hearing this or these artists , and they &apos;re a genius , instead of having a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think to allow a naked person that he thinks he or she &apos;s like the vessel , like the wax and the essence and the source of all the divine , creative greek , is a little bit more responsible to be a human spirit ,
it &apos;s like somebody to eat the sun .
the emperor and bullying all of egos and it creates all these milestones to success .
i think that this is the last 500 years of being wiped out of the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question : is that the question ?
can we change it ?
maybe to go back to an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creative .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just deny the most 500 years of the 500 years of cheating in a single talk .
and there are certainly people in this audience who would be exposed to the scientific concerns of the notion of the notion of -- basically -- -- the most powerful , people who are acting and more and more and more .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to call is : why not ?
why not think about this ?
because it makes a lot of sense as much as everything i heard , if it was about that , the absolute crazy thing to explain of the creative process of creative process .
a process that &apos;s going to be -- like everybody knows that ever ever tried to do something -- in other words , everyone here -- not always , always , always , acting .
in fact , sometimes he can feel very repetitive .
i had recently met a encounter as i met the extraordinary american poet , who now is about 90 , but she was a whole life of the whole life , but she told me that she was growing up and hear how a poem was growing on the landscape
she said it would be like a train train .
the land on them would be a little bit more .
she felt if it came , because it would bring the earth under her feet .
she knew that she could just do one of these things , and that was -- in your words -- in your words -- the devil race like the devil .
she ran like the devil for the house as she was tracking from this poem , and it was just that she quickly had to get enough to a piece of paper and a pen , and i could put it through it , and put it on the sheet
in other words , she wasn &apos;t very quick enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the house and hit the poem by looking at the country , and -- like she said , &quot; look for the country and i &apos;d go
and then there were these moments -- the part i never forget -- she said that there were moments in which they almost signed it .
so , she runs to the house , and you take the paper and the poem goes through you and she picks up a pen , and she &apos;s going to get a pen , and she said -- it was like that with her other hand after that ,
she caught the poem on his tail and she moved back into her body and she took it on the sheet of paper .
and in these opportunities , the poem came up and intact on the paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
when i heard that , i thought that &apos;s extraordinary -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going on .
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a computer designer . to work on the same day , i have to get up every day and sweat , and really , really uncomfortable , and really uncomfortable .
but even i had this thing to be blown up in my favorite process sometimes .
and i guess that many of you have done this too .
even i had work or ideas that made out of a source of me , which i really couldn &apos;t identify .
what is that for a thing ?
and how do we get to lose this relationship without any of our minds , but to keep ourselves in the opposite of the world ?
for me , the best living example , how to do this can be tom &apos;s musician , and i was able to interview him a couple of years ago .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of his life was tom the embodiment of the modern modern artist who tried to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
but then he became older and quiet . he told me that he was going to go to a hoodie in los angeles , and there was all it changed for him .
he drove with high speed as he hears a melody , which is , as a bit of a melody , it &apos;s a lot of the time for him to be consistent , and he &apos;s going to have it . it &apos;s a little bit of a sudden
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil .
so he starts , these old people in him will go up like this , like , i &apos;m going to lose this thing and get out of this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t do it .
but instead of getting into panic , he just heard .
he ended up doing the whole session and something completely new .
he just looked at the sky and said , &quot; sorry , can you see that i &apos;m driving car ? &quot;
so , i &apos;m looking at the same thing as i could write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a moment of time , if i can take care of you .
if not , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;re somebody else today .
go and pop leonard cohen .
it &apos;s changed its whole approach .
not the work itself . that was still dark as a result , and the one .
but the process and the heavy product of the world that was going to be there was that it was a genius of himself , where he didn &apos;t have any trouble and he left it , where he was going to be able to do it , and he
it could give a strange , surprising , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the respected thing , which wasn &apos;t quite tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit of the way i worked and saved it once .
this idea saved me as i was in the middle of the street of the street , and i was sleeping , love , loving , and i fell in one of these panels that we all fall when we were working on something and it &apos;s not going to
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just take the project to the project .
but then i remembered how tom had spoken in the free sky and i tried it .
so i took my view of the manuscript and i talked to my comment in direction of a empty corner of the room .
i &apos;m talking about , &quot; listen , you stop , you , you know , and i know both when this book isn &apos;t brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see , i &apos;m going to invest everything i have , invest . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have it better , you have to pop up here and get your share of running running .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that ... you know what , then the devil .
i &apos;m going to write on , because this is my job .
and i want to go to record that i was today for my piece of jobs here .
because ... at the end of it , it &apos;s like following , centuries ago , in the desert , people in the deserts , and they gathered into the copper dances and music that were stopped for hours -- until dawn .
these were the strong things that were great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but back and again , very rare , something special happened , one of the actors actually became a very special one .
and i know you know what i mean because i know you &apos;ve all seen a performance in your life .
it was as if the time was going to be more , and the dancer had a kind of a kind of a kind of a design trip . he didn &apos;t do anything else than he did before -- 1,000 nights before .
and suddenly , he didn &apos;t seem to be in human .
it &apos;s been lit up by the inside , and it &apos;s light down , and everything is going to be a divine fire .
when this was something that happened at the time , people knew what this was . they called it in his name .
they put their hands together and started singing : &quot; aw allah , allah , allah , god , god , god . &quot;
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historical , a little bit of the time , when the first , the first , they took this practice , and the humiliation of the centuries changed in the course of the centuries of childhood allah , allah , allah , and the most interesting thing that you
if a performer in spain has something impossible , something magical has done : the mercy of allah , the cat , the mercy , the mercy , parenting , great , convincing , convincing god , because it &apos;s a glimpse of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need this .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning when the dancer wakes up and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he doesn &apos;t have a more , of god &apos;s name .
it &apos;s just an aging arm with a limb &apos;s knee , and maybe he will never get back to those heights .
and maybe anybody &apos;s ever going to call god name , if he turns around , but what would he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most popular , of a creative life of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be very full of googlers when they didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of their existence would come from them .
if you &apos;re just thinking that you &apos;re a warning -- from a spectacular source for a very spectacular time of your life , which is passed on to someone else if you &apos;re done with it .
if we start thinking about it , it changes all of this .
so i started thinking and so i think with security in the past few months , while i was working on the book that &apos;s soon going to appear -- as the dangerous , frightening , scary , very anticipated of my favorite success .
what i &apos;ve got to tell myself about , if i &apos;m going to be crazy about it , is not afraid .
not a moron .
just make your job .
it &apos;s still for your contribution to what he is like .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the dumb whoa is , you know , that &apos;s a little bit of a time to decide , for a moment , for a moment of wonder , a moment of wonder , the kind of thing that you have , the ted system .
and if not , dance still dance .
and i got a lot of security , and i think , for you .
i think that i feel that , we should teach this .
so , the most important thing ! the ted company for you , despite all of you , just that you have the mere human love and the most sophisticated , for being there .
thank you .
thank you .
so , you know !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic arctic , the arctic arctic , had been the size of the lower 48 states to have 40 percent of the lower united states .
but this doesn &apos;t press very much enough to make the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic arctic is the center of our global health system .
it grows in winter and declining in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a very , very special thing that happened in the last 25 years .
the key thing is , with red marks .
as you can see , it &apos;s going to be in the dark sea . this is the annual ice in winter ; it &apos;s the summer of the summer .
this is called the &quot; five years old or older , &quot; almost like blood , which is out of the body here .
in 25 years it &apos;s gone from here .
this is a problem , because warming is the frozen reason to be able to put the arctic in the arctic , where there are big amounts of carbon dioxide , which , if it &apos;s made , of microbes that are implemented by methane .
compared to the whole amount of energy in the atmosphere , this amount of light could double if we cross this critical point .
today , in some flat lakes , in alaska , methane from itself from the water .
professor merchant walter walter university in alaska is with another flat lake at a different surface of the last winter .
wow !
you &apos;re fine . the question is , how do you get sympathy .
and one reason is , this enormous heat source is rotating greenland from the north .
this is a $ 100 percent .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is the most salient river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the level of sea level goes up , you get into the ocean .
these rivers take the very long time .
the other end of the planet , antarctica , the largest largest education on the planet .
last month researchers reported that the entire continent has a negative model of a negative .
and the most important thing about a few of the things that showed you is particularly powerful in the melt .
this is 20 feet of land level , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the most salient , you see new lakes , which were a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their own family lanes from this .
in the balcony , this glacier is the most prolific for this city .
the most sophisticated have been expanding .
but if you &apos;re going to go out and get the most water off , the most water goes off .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in the sierra sea was seen in the sierra york .
this is the main problem .
and the predictions , as you read them , are serious .
this is the most dramatic thing in the world that leads to a dramatic increase .
and the disasters around the world have never been shown in a really highly sophisticated and unprecedented extent .
four times as many in the last 30 years like this in the most prolific .
this is a completely valid thing .
if you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it &apos;s called the &quot;
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 all 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the oceans .
look at the eastern pacific in the eastern pacific of western and the west continent of the indian , where there &apos;s a radical decline in the sea .
the biggest one factor for global warming , next to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning from fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most biggest problem .
the united states is one of the largest largest largest people , together with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot of more people .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones who were shopping in the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the most important and more of the time , a dollar &apos;s last year , spent a dollar last year to promote clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me about something .
to christmas christmas , i went home in tennessee , a billion tons of u.s. production .
you &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is in our entire country of the u.s. economy of america .
this was what happened to christmas .
one of the commercials of the christmas center was this .
the main model is a very happy , happy fellow .
there &apos;s a skin in the skin and abundance of america , and it helps our economy to grow .
and the most delicious is going to be clean .
he &apos;s affordable and more affordable , and workers stay in people and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful thing is the head of the internet &apos;s head .
let me say one of the things that i &apos;m saying . al gore , nancy dunlap , harry dunlap , you know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection has been called two procedures .
this is one part of her .
in the process of climate change , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
so we have a second to the top of the world , a significant significant school project to spend a more significant place on the way to bring the truth over coal .
the fact is , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and also also also smells good .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
leave that , let &apos;s leave you with that .
coal coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean , clean .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean water .
and yet , the burning of coal is the main of the global warming that you see , which is remarkable clean , which you see here , changes everything .
look at it , this is the right , clean food , clean .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of the national security .
america is in a crisis that is the economy that national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread , which all connects these together is our dependence on the surface of the fuel , like dirty coal and oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free us from this kind of thing .
the americas with 100 percent clean electricity in the next 10 years , within the next 10 years .
a plan to bring america back to work , make us safer and help , to stop the global warming .
finally , a solution , the big enough , our problems are to solve our problems .
the americas are new . find more out of it .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a plastic of america .
one of the fastest ways of our dependence on old , dirty fuels , which binds our world to reduce us .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to get good jobs to do good jobs .
the americas are new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be fast , go alone .
if you want to get far , go together . &quot;
we have to come far , and quickly .
thank you .
i want to start asking you to be able to be able to play your childhood at the time of your childhood , when you played with the computer .
while they realized how to stretch down the hands and move the hands , they actually learned , and they actually learned to make sense and change problems and change problems .
the spatial view is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist -- inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- with my favorite friends , and my colleagues , i started to wonder , what if we could use computers , which is a digital tool , and how to do it , and how
this question was that we decided to go to exploration of the answer and we started to develop the design of the answer .
and i &apos;m a very short computer in the size of a computer , a smart computer in the size of a football .
you can move with your hand , you can see each other , you can see your movements and you can have a screen and you have a screen and a computer camera .
more importantly , are physically , why you can only move it through the body &apos;s hands and move your hands .
and the most important is an example of a new generation of the world &apos;s data data .
and if these tools are going to be physical and a conscious awareness of their movements , each other , and the sole of our movements , can begin to see the way we see the new and entertaining information systems .
i start with some simple examples .
this is the most important thing for the most important , and when i put it in a direction of bubble , the video is played forward ; when i go to the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits are true to each other .
so if i put them side-by-side , they make their interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the way you &apos;re surrounded , you can notice and you can become nervous .
and they feel their movements and bend their movements .
an interesting episode of interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures to data like this , like color , how to do this with fluid .
in this case , we have three main engines as a function of water , and i can use them to put color in the middle of the center where they &apos;re going to mix .
if we &apos;re zooming it out , we can make a little bit of a little bit more enjoyable .
there &apos;s also some nice opportunities in education as languages , mathematics or engineering , where we give people the opportunity to trial fast trial and the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a fibonacci array that i &apos;m making with a simple piece of puzzle .
this is a game with words that are kind of a mixture of a kind of mixture of plastic and water .
basically , you get every round of your time on every single side of your time , and you &apos;re trying to form words , you &apos;re going to be documenting , you &apos;re going to spend this over a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , it &apos;s got up and you have a new design structure and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some kids who came on a trip to the media lab , and i could move them to try and try and put it on a video .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact in this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people testing it .
this is our youngest , the bottom of the day .
it turns out he wanted to stack the world &apos;s license .
so for him , they were just the only news .
this is a interactive computer system .
we wanted to develop a design company for a design system .
this is 46 .
he can bring new characters into the scene by blowing the laser off the table , showing this character .
here he is the sun &apos;s sun .
the sun goes on on it .
now he &apos;s going to get a tractor in the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the most open and it can put it side-by-side , and it can make the characters interact with ...
... his own story invent .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open and he can decide how they evolved .
flying cat .
the last example i &apos;ve been doing today is to show it , is a key for a computer for the world that we &apos;ve developed recently , and in the sound of sound as a sound , the bass and drums act .
each one has four different variations ; you can select that you want to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence that you can put in any pattern in any pattern .
and you &apos;re going to get them to a simple one by just holding a laser bottle on a plane .
there are effects that you can change live like hall and filter .
you connect it with a certain note and you will then get it to punch .
and then more sobering effects like speed and volume that you &apos;re doing on the whole sequence .
so let &apos;s look at .
we start in the front of the world &apos;s dna , and we &apos;re going to combine these in a series of things , and they add a little bit of the voice , and they add a little bit more the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something else to do this .
and now i &apos;m going to take the filter with the drums , so i can control the effect of live .
i can accelerate all the sequence , by putting the pace into one or another direction .
and now i &apos;m going to take the filter on the bass , for something more expression .
i can make the sequence as it moves .
and i don &apos;t have to plan it in the front of the day , but can improvise ; they &apos;re extending them in the course of the time , or lower .
and finally , i can put the whole sequence , by running the most sophisticated one .
thank you .
so as you can see , my desire is to develop new forms of design that are better to fit the way our brains and bodies work .
and today , i had time to give you a part of this new kind of new school and some of the possibilities that we work in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you to the way is that we &apos;re on the verge of this new generation of dna to interaction with digital media , which is the information that we need to bring in our terms .
thank you .
i &apos;m looking at all of you with the conversation .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;m really happy to say that i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what should be the point of data ?
i just have to step back to this , and it &apos;s a little bit of a sudden , and it &apos;s a little bit of time with modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been doing this for a few years , and i &apos;ve been starting to do it because i want to just know , and it &apos;s also even what i wanted to do , which i &apos;ve learned in the study of
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to sort of get closer to the matter , so .
i think that the molecular biology is now speaking , so it &apos;s all in general , biotechnology , everything you count to , synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now , now , is very important , and much more importantly , will be in the future .
there &apos;s so much things that were adapted to this whole collective plants of the world .
now there &apos;s craig venter in the u.s. community trying to make the oil , which is gasoline from algae .
and then there &apos;s things that come in completely in the day-to-day life , which most people don &apos;t know , but for example , the most important thing that we &apos;re allowing is to wash the laundry to the ground , and also genetically engineered enzymes .
and the list can continue to continue through the list .
and so from the interest of this technology , i &apos;m going to continue to go on to the point of time .
so what now is there ?
most people know most people who are familiar with the most .
computers are hacking , and then it will be in the media , yes , the hackers break somewhere and claws and so on .
so , this is kind of sad for the most sad , because it doesn &apos;t seem to be what they actually started like this and what is actually behind .
and that &apos;s the most important thing , in the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , and it &apos;s also started to come up with the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative way to solve a problem .
and the problem is that it &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can just be a kind of a sound problem , which is how things simplify things , so any kind of a question of the question , and
and it &apos;s been just filled with software , but there &apos;s also in the middle of the world , there &apos;s a whole range of the food that &apos;s all about to make all sorts of things that are going on .
and now , just as i think of biology , and i want to take this metaphor that &apos;s coming from synthetic biology , that biology is actually a more sophisticated code because , the most important code is a more abstract code , because it &apos;s matter , it
but it &apos;s also a code , and it can also code and so you can also hack it , so , and i found that i found incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper with it .
and this actually took two eight really a form of this , these networks .
there &apos;s a riot in the skyline , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with cooperation in india , but now , in india , or active people around the world , have a member of people around the world .
these are a more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and collaboration with scientists with scientists , and they &apos;re asking them to do with these technologies , and to make it possible , and they &apos;re all more capable of doing it .
but it &apos;s actually about finding such a kind of a kind of a carbon engineer , so you have a reasonable deal with that .
and then there &apos;s a partial frontier of the nintendo ocean , the internet center .
this is a network of the network that is actually more like this , which is a kind of forum where you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be a bit and a conversation online .
they &apos;re a little bit of a technical device , and also a little bit of a bit of a bit of a sudden , and then they &apos;re going to be at the age of the age .
and from these networks that have been very popular for all of the popular , it has been so a scene that i want to do briefly .
here in the picture on the top , you see the piano that &apos;s a little bit of a school , so basically a kind of school , so a private school , a private school , where everyone can get .
children , old , all kinds of people , just to go through it , and they have a lab , and they &apos;re looking at what can be done when they do that .
and here &apos;s a group on the left , and it &apos;s called the , you know , there &apos;s a lot of time , but it &apos;s pretty long .
more than these other two networks .
and they also have a kind of artistic aspect of biological materials , and , yes , also , also , the same thing , and combine it in quite a way .
a group of ankara that i met a while ago , which is a very , very common one that would like to give the public to give more what you learn in college , and that &apos;s how to do it on the ground of the little , and
and i have a lecture up in copenhagen in the medical museum in copenhagen with a exhibition to the subject .
and this is , yes , that &apos;s the most important person , but the only thing that all of which is a really rich , is this fascination to the technology .
and what you can do with this and just focus on the society that is , and ask to ask , okay , what do you want to do , what do you want to join , you have interest with this ?
so , okay , so to try to hack biology , you need to kind of have material .
you need to , of course , biological materials , and you need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
or , what you normally understand under a lab , these are kind of kind of like a kind of , very expensive machines , extremely expensive , just for the most expensive , trained , trained , trained academics with a ph.d. and so on .
and our approach was to say , okay , we &apos;re going to stop that , that actually , you don &apos;t have to do that .
this is actually not necessary because every single one of each other has been developed , actually , the technology has been more sophisticated than most of the most important , that &apos;s really like that .
and the third with this premise with this premise , then brian &apos;s , for example , is trying to put a video center , put a video center , and then it &apos;s a kind of a , and it &apos;s a , yes , so that it &apos;s
so every one that has been a soup of soup that he has been standing too long , even once .
i &apos;ve tried to do this in my lab , a little bit of scale , and then i put it on ebay and made a little bit of a bit of a bit of a sudden , and it &apos;s a little bit of a bit of a sudden
now , that should be not a joke , but it &apos;s .
here in the bottom of the picture , you see the lab , in the south states , so it &apos;s such a garden garage with the same way that the university has a group of the city that has a group of things in paris , which is what
and this is a little bit of a sudden , which is also mentioned , this is the kind of a kind of a kind of a design model in the principle of molecular biology .
and yes , you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively diverse , so there &apos;s a lot of people who do that alone , to big organizations , so that they have more of the organizations that have been more likely to do in their own form of view .
but always the approach that it &apos;s just going to be and it should be accessible .
the first project we &apos;ve done as international group , when we &apos;re sort of aware of ourselves , is we &apos;re going to be here as real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re now , and we know how to do that , and we
and then came from the most popular website of the founder , and i said , we &apos;ve got to actually meet ourselves , also , and then really , two events , and then two events , and then two things , and then , in the most ,
and , because then , you know , yes , who are we , what are we going to want , what do we want to tell , what do we want to tell ?
and what are our values and what are our minds , our foundation , our foundation ?
and then we have a huge job of working on this .
this was pretty intuitive , so everybody has just his wishes , his wishes , and what it would be to do , then , then , .
and i think i think that i was doing a very good code .
and we have that , and that &apos;s not appropriate , but that &apos;s a moment , i think , that &apos;s pretty good , that people are quite convinced , that &apos;s the way people are right .
and we actually tried to put that back in the academic world , but it &apos;s not that way .
so i think we &apos;re actually in the way that we &apos;re going to go and move a step further than the academic world .
now , what projects do we do now ?
a project that i did with the most important in switzerland was that we wanted to create a so-called optical view or optical orphans .
this is , if you focus a laser beam on a room , you can catch little particles in the air , or in the liquid and then moving in this focus , so , that &apos;s the way that a kind of a design effect in principle is basically
this works really , it &apos;s done in academic science , and we &apos;ve thought , okay , we might be going to get a webcam , then we &apos;ve taken a webcam , which is the lens , the lens , it &apos;s about a microscope that is increasing
this is what you see down there .
and then we have a little bit of the torch of the torch and the torch pulled up and then tried to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , unfortunately , it didn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of it .
another project that made out of the french group of paris , which is a great thing , is pretty cool .
and it &apos;s like , well , this is a kind of a design machine , so that &apos;s how it &apos;s like a little bit , so he &apos;s got to be busy with a computer &apos;s job , his favorite story is sam atwood .
he then made this helmet there , and it &apos;s in cooperation with the museum that was at the museum .
and then you could go to the space in the room , sit on this chair , put this helmet in .
and then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought or how they thought , is different lights in the room .
it was a pretty nice project .
another thing from the u.s. , which is also with this kind of thing that has been there with this kind of thing , is the most prolific , complicated word , is the goldilocks word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , to reproduce , to reproduce , to reproduce , to reproduce , so you can see it .
so if i do that now the most popular thing to do in the crime scene , then there are any kind of a little bit of a time , and then they &apos;re going to make this kind of technique , and then they can say , okay ,
and the machines that do that , they &apos;re quite expensive , they &apos;re going to buy commercial , the cheapest ones that go to the ground .
and that &apos;s not a lot of the time , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be much .
so this is just a application of many , which you can do with it .
and they have two of these axes , and they said , okay , we &apos;re doing easier and cheaper , and then it &apos;s open source source , so open source hardware , which is the cheapest information , and now they &apos;re the cheapest ones of these devices
i think it &apos;s like six dollars or something .
but it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s still in a frame where it &apos;s going to be clear , but it &apos;s a lot of the time that it &apos;s going to be more available .
so it &apos;s a very , very exciting hack .
a project i started to start with was building a computer company .
and the way that you do it is , yes , like a kind of a kind of a design that would take about this , two centimeters or something .
you pour up the air of the piano , and then you put the water in these areas , and then i &apos;ve taken the tag and then put it on a onion and then put it on the ground .
so the device you see there is not working .
but this is my prototype , which was quite wild , but pretty much , like this , on a branch that was on the side , the thing , electronics and pressure , and that was the pressure , and it was the pressure .
and then i took a little bit of a time and i put it together .
a key thing , if you do the full power with water , has the enough pressure , so i think there &apos;s about 40 to the top bar .
and then you can accelerate the particles , and then you go down to the onion , and then you go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about the same , or something like this , or something like this , and it &apos;s about 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically doable .
and so , this is the moment that the core of the scene is going to be able to increase this availability of technology and also increase the information and the information industry that people can get engaged there .
because , as the beginning said , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have quite a bit of a clue , and also not a chance to make it really good .
because if you &apos;re just reading about it , that &apos;s not the same thing as if you &apos;ve done it or you &apos;ve seen it .
and i think technology is always becoming more important in our modern societies .
and if you can make a personal citizen in society , and you can join , then you need to have access to knowledge and to the technology .
and you have to do it , and you can understand , and understand it .
and then the most open open source of the brain and citizen science .
so you just have a citizens in the position of being able to get through these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s the core of the world &apos;s core .
these are the people who are officially packed on the website , and they &apos;re a website website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and also , interesting is that they &apos;re also held in southeast asia .
and that &apos;s what i think are there , there are fewer people there than actually exist .
so i know some of the ones that don &apos;t have to put up .
and these are just the canadians that are individual people .
and in part , with these kind of predatory cells , these places put together .
and that &apos;s really in the beginning .
and as i said , it &apos;s just started .
and so , the most important , the most important , because the most important thing in berlin was the first one .
and this is a gigantic network now to very good , yes , the whole thing that &apos;s represented all over the world .
and we hope , of course , that we &apos;re going to take a similar amount of spreading and then be pretty good , so that there are more people going to be involved in the same way .
and i would invite everybody to deal with it , and even try to do what you do .
it &apos;s not so simple now , but it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not impossible if you have enough curiosity , and you get to get it far .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hello .
how do we do people ?
this is a question that &apos;s very moving to me as a designer , but also in the realm of the brain , and in the field of the user , in the user , the user &apos;s disease .
there &apos;s about how to go to the people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and make them a very common experience .
i think that the interactive media in us , cognitive models , is to compute the paradigm that has been calculated in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we can only create the only way that we can do it through interactive media .
and this is very amazing because you actually believe that these are the things that you &apos;ve seen , that you &apos;re going to have a good job in the future , but actually it &apos;s that the future is exactly in our own body , in our own body
what are the most exciting models ?
i &apos;ve been writing four more sophisticated projects , and i want to just explain to you .
and to make cognitive models and that &apos;s the models that we have in the pre-industrial times .
and to this kind of data , the models that we have is basically natural proportion to virtuality .
and that sounds like , basically , unusual .
i &apos;m going to go back to this , and i &apos;ll try to prove you by trying to have a natural ratio of virtuality .
the second aspect is that since this kind of time , we &apos;ve been able to have a lot of the models of the models in the world , very , very , very , very promising , even though we use a language of language .
and the third area , which explains itself .
we all know that the interactive media is a definition of definition , which is the denial of the contradiction , and of course , we say that we &apos;re feeling the contradiction today as normal .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of the world &apos;s population .
now , as it is with virtuality , which is actually the most basic thing in the world .
i want to show you that .
how many doors do the house in which they live ?
and that &apos;s not what we &apos;re going to answer to them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen to this and happen right now .
they go through the spirit of this house , in the middle of the house , and they &apos;re looking at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
they &apos;re making the reality and it &apos;s a very computer .
fantastic , right ?
and there &apos;s a way to be able to do the virtual reality for example , and we can actually put the virtual reality in our brain process , and we can actually do it all the time .
and this wealth that the virtual reality that the reality had to do , had needed the people in the pre-industrial times , because they had nothing .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any more inclusive .
they had no mass media .
the only thing that had the head .
and in this head , memory was going to be .
in this head , freudian and using this virtual images , the imagination , were also passed up , and they &apos;ve been passed up .
and so it &apos;s also so strong in us that we can deal with the virtuality of virtuality .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little trip .
yes , that &apos;s what it is .
the interesting thing about this is that at that time , the human being used to be a lot of time and medium itself .
now , if you &apos;re going to think about a piece of time .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i &apos;ll talk to you about that again .
the main tool of the brain &apos;s time has been the case for the stories .
so , the preacher , priests , called the &quot; vagina , &quot; were added to the other , to maintain knowledge in stories .
and we &apos;re still going to be very , very strong in stories .
the author of the book is formed , jonathan atwood , according to the year of the year , we still returned to the young hours of the day with the world &apos;s business .
that means for a child that &apos;s going to be able to reach the most of the life of the life of the world &apos;s most , very much of the time .
now we think our love to play is that we have sat on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far missing .
and that &apos;s a lot further to the cultures of the original times .
but for me , in the field of interactive media as a particularly impressive , we have stuck in our biological memory , the ability to think of the ability to think of it .
i brought you an example of the north american tribe of the u.s. tribe .
and the lives lived in the u.s. community of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very , very highly crude area , and you had to get away from island to island to get food .
and they did this with so-called so-called the so-called &quot; oops . &quot;
you might know that if you &apos;re interested in the australian village , you know , the australian village .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have a military , but they have used the same as they have , or also they have a little bit more populous .
and what the interesting thing about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be taken across songs .
where the language was quoted by the internet of the book .
that means you &apos;re going to have sound of sound and rhythm .
and these sounds and the rhythm of geology , the topography of a region , demonstrated the topography of a region , and of course , that it allows you to get these songs and put it in different places and put it back to the left , and then
why don &apos;t we sing to get from a to b to b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
it &apos;s happening that &apos;s so much of the machine &apos;s trial .
we &apos;ve moved to the so-called so-called the so-called &quot; test effect . &quot;
it &apos;s happened that the machine &apos;s machine and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s the book that &apos;s happening .
and that &apos;s what happens , that we have the responsibility for our memories and the ones that have changed their own properties of our individual memories on external media .
on the book , and on the picture .
so unfortunately , we have a piece of god &apos;s play .
virtuality is suddenly alien to us , and it has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a famous school teacher , is so far to say that these media companies , he means the book and the image , so not television , the internet , and so on , which we call mass media today , and we have our ability to
let &apos;s make a little bit of a little bit of a time .
the lead to the machine .
what does affect our thinking and on our memory system ?
then the key effect of the original cultures are the pre-industrial cultures .
and they &apos;re more and more more powerful over the centuries of the centuries , and more of the time that we have had the impact of the brain .
so , instead of remembering us , we have a standard , widespread , widespread , masses of memories of memories that we can rely on our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more ourselves .
we have a abstract language of a language .
we don &apos;t think of the thing anymore in images that are more than images , but we &apos;re going to do it to you our language .
we &apos;ve used to that that things are going linear .
and we &apos;ve been accepted as a law , and there &apos;s only exceptions , like the most important .
what &apos;s left is the most important thing .
still , we &apos;re a very arrested as a symbol of the very , very strong .
the question is , what is it coming out ?
we had the most salient thing , we had the machine company , and we went to the name of the name , and we &apos;re now called the &quot;
it sounds very much like the science fiction , and it sounds very basic , i know .
but these concepts of the design of the world that bring us back to this possibility of the ability to explore our skills .
there &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about the news of the , it &apos;s about the news of the world .
i want to just explain a little bit about it .
there are technical concepts like the augmented reality , which means the extended reality .
so if you look at google , for example , that &apos;s a concept that allows us to combine the virtual world with real world , which means our eardrum to the world , which is the virtual , natural , natural , which is going to be more normal
another example is that called virtual reality .
so , of course , that &apos;s what i &apos;m talking about in the context of my talk , because we &apos;re moving physically in not existing , virtual worlds , to the model of the design system .
and another example is the most important example , smart systems .
these are rooms that can respond to a human being .
all of that needs the ability to accept our basic ability , in virtuality than a real habitat .
i &apos;ve been in the conclusion and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the most powerful project , and the ted community , the ted designer , is the most powerful , recyclable , recyclable , and more cosmopolitan .
and the two of these are also here today .
maybe you can get up to your very quickly , so you can talk to the two of the things that you &apos;re talking about .
and this project , i brought it as an example , as a result of this , is how to get cognitive models .
and the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
what the most powerful of course is extremely painful and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i say computer games , they &apos;ve probably been very likely to see that any people have people who are in front of some of their favorite friends or they play with some of the things that they do with their hand .
anyway , they do that in the way .
this is a game for outside .
and that &apos;s what i thought is that i discover the world &apos;s outside world , so i discover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data that we produce , the real world , we produce .
i apologize to me that i have to summarize so much .
you can explain that much better , because there &apos;s more than more than that .
and it &apos;s about that i discover a city by looking at what places positive or negative .
and so i get from the city to a very different view , a very different impression , which i see negative and positive zones of a city and getting a whole different , virtual map of a very real city .
and we can see that now .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is another explanation of what you see .
of course , these virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , is clear .
and with a kind of flashlight , we can see these virtual worlds .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize my talk , and i &apos;d like to put the qualities that we &apos;ve made from the most of the design , and the skills that we &apos;ve been doing is that we &apos;ve been able to get a little bit of the
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very happy to be with you .
i &apos;ve been asked if this bag is a little bit of a bag of bag and i &apos;m going to talk to you instead of being .
it won &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m also going to disappear , which is there .
but i &apos;m just doing it , i &apos;m just doing a little bit more curious .
yes , kids are from curious or should be curious , designers also .
i &apos;m a creator of house , so i &apos;m also with the subject of curiosity and how it changes the curiosity of the curiosity , and why we might lose curiosity and why we might have to be really upset and so on .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re doing next to the actual existence of the actual experience .
if professors are curious , they &apos;re often in the n of the n .
and that &apos;s what i had over the last half a year .
a key thing to natural natural users interface interface .
now , you &apos;re going to ask , why are all the designers going to be with this natural , more cosmopolitan of communication , interaction and so on .
and there i &apos;m just one of these little devices , because things are always more intuitive , always natural , more natural , and there you have to look at what &apos;s actually , of course , for us , what is more powerful or intuitive .
and before the background , i have a lot of natural users in the area of design , so the next generation in the human computer is so much of the human computer in the relationship of the human computer , which is how our tools are changing or how
so i was busy doing it when it &apos;s intuitive or intuitive .
maybe again , you have to look at it again .
why does this happen at all ?
so if we look at the development of our society , here &apos;s a very short point , then we &apos;re moving from the third to the fourth in the fourth circle of time or a little bit of a sudden .
so from modern in the world .
every society is shaped by a plastic system .
the first time , the language of the language .
that means you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve talked to a common language , you could communicate with each other , and it &apos;s moved into the same cave , or in other areas , cities , or in other areas , have created a form of life .
but the most powerful thing was , the language , something very natural , something very , very living .
you had to learn , so no kind of a toddler can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it , of course , and of course .
this was then rented by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a very high , because you &apos;re the living language of the life , which is what &apos;s called the &quot; what &apos;s going on , &quot; what &apos;s going on , i start to start and start to go and start it in stone and so forth
depending on how i &apos;m going to go and when i &apos;m a little bit of time , it &apos;s a very different story than if there &apos;s a living in it .
but then , the point of time , it was a piece of writing , and then she got a tag .
then the next generation we actually lived in today is still living .
this is just the pressure and print in the background , and it &apos;s a bit of a print with hangers and other .
at the time , it was just a kind of a design center where the aurochs , the people , and others , are actually , you know , be insane when the people start reading , then they want to be a completely lethal , and that &apos;s of
and now we come to the next generation and the exciting thing is just a few hundred years , and we &apos;re actually in this particular phase phase , that we &apos;re actually doing this in this particular phase phase , that we &apos;re doing something like this .
of course , we completely , of course , because we see a page that &apos;s the new media , the social media , facebook and so on .
with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what &apos;s going on on the old thinking , don &apos;t tell you that in the most democratic , and no beef is more or more or other phenomena , which i want to just do , and i
and these two worlds are just moving together , new and old thinking .
so , the exciting thing is , if you look at this new society , these new society , these kinds of things , very many mechanisms , principles and environmental patterns from the surface of the world .
but now not more on local level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the theme ecology is a global .
not , if i think locally , and the neighbor thinks less ecologically , then it doesn &apos;t work all the way .
that means that the local village is actually a global village with the same principles , of course , because , of course , very intuitive , but also the total transparency .
so , as you knew in the village , who has what has happened with who and when , this is what happens today , this extension of our self is in the process of this kind of non-zero-sum system .
it is that we know global dyson and always better and better and better .
so , like it was just on the village .
i &apos;m just busy looking at what &apos;s called , because what &apos;s going on is , of course , what &apos;s going on for us , what &apos;s going on , what &apos;s the difference ? what does the difference ?
because often people come , they can &apos;t make it a little bit of the way that everybody can do it .
so you have to engage with what is called , because it &apos;s not just changing it , it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s going to be better .
and when , of course , something intuitive and how i can take as a creator and just make things like this , and just sort of , they &apos;re so intuitive , so they &apos;re very intuitive , so they &apos;re very intuitive , and they &apos;re just like
you &apos;re looking at it , also while the old age of perception and the delivery of perception .
and that &apos;s of course , which is where you start and look and look and say , okay , i just look at the inside itself .
and how does it look like it &apos;s in this ?
so how do we work when we &apos;re doing it ?
and what does , of course , is , really intuitive and how do our channels of perception and how works the cognitive processing ?
because steve jobs once said , you know , you have to dig out to dig up to dig up the way that it was going to be a lot of time .
so you really have to look at the detail when i want to make something a little bit more intuitive or intuitive , which means the core .
and there &apos;s already that you see a very , seven senses , most of us , we &apos;re just five , now , even seven , because it &apos;s certainly going to be the next future , and it &apos;s also the next thing to do .
and looking at how we process information , how do we take information ?
and to say , what is information ?
information is a difference that is a difference .
many use the word , but you don &apos;t know what it means to make it possible .
but i have to understand in the core , in the nature of understanding where information is going to be information , when information is going to be , and from information , so i know how to do things like i &apos;m so intuitive or of course .
and of course , how design is going to impact the perception .
we see this , if i make things , then i can make them confusing , like on the right , where i don &apos;t know what is salt and pepper , or i can kind of make them intuitive by showing things .
so very much natural , in a single dish , but i look at just where salt and pepper is in .
and if i say somebody , i give you salt or pepper , then he &apos;ll think of the right , where is it in it .
and the left , and then , you know , just intuitive and then hopefully , that no sugar is in it , the salt just put out of it .
but also our perception itself , as it makes us .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the little , although it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just equally equal to the same , and yet our perception , depending on what context we do .
anybody know what that is ?
join on .
and the other thing is , the design of the game should work .
there &apos;s more than my glasses .
so it &apos;s n &apos; circle .
a second circle starts to manipulate certain similarities or to associate .
and then if i hold a second of a second , then we don &apos;t just see a unit , which is a circle , circle , circle and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see a unit , a circle , a circle , another
this is called a little bit of a sudden , or just a little bit of a sudden that &apos;s affecting us in perception .
so , the creator of the creator , the most amazing semester , the great semester .
and the way that it &apos;s close , the continuity of the continuity and so on .
and then , often , forget again in the third .
but that &apos;s an essential important part , if you want to make things so intuitive as well .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting is the view .
so , just sort of , very banal , is very banal , but it &apos;s very exciting if you &apos;re getting closer to it .
so we have the eyes on the front , and now you think we &apos;re seeing the back of the front .
that &apos;s wrong .
you can see the back of the back .
and so they &apos;re a assumption to the front of the way that they see something they recognize , the circle .
that means we &apos;re only seeing our way before we see it , and then we see it back to the back of our brain , to say , okay , okay , okay , so , okay , we &apos;re going to go back to that .
i &apos;ve got this very cognitive design system , you have what you want to see .
and that &apos;s where it comes back .
and then it goes back to the front , because the back of the back is not the back and says , well , you &apos;re really going to look at it , and you &apos;re going to be sure , you know , that &apos;s what you want to
and then it goes back to the back and then it &apos;s actually going to be seen .
so a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very clear process , and what happens to the things that are happening .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s known from you that picture .
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve described in the same way .
now , everyone from this pattern is trying to recognize something .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s aware of what &apos;s possible .
does anybody see something specific ?
a design system , right .
if i &apos;ve seen that , that &apos;s a little bit of a time that &apos;s inside , you know .
you &apos;ll never forget it anymore because i &apos;ll show you where the most important thing is .
now you see the most important thing .
and then , you see it , you &apos;re always seeing it .
so , i mean , i &apos;ve actually got them , actually , that they don &apos;t recognize patterns of the pattern , but i have a little bit of a time in short time , and i &apos;ve always got this dog in the short picture again .
and this projection is the projection of seeing , and you see it .
now i know it , and now i &apos;m going to go to the front of the time that i see the most important thing .
i see the most important thing .
so , very exciting processes that then , in this , yes , is not actually , but here in this particular mass of the mass , it &apos;s just going to happen in this particular area .
does anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know something about three seconds , until i kind of look out of the present , i can also bridge very well , and i can also bridge it very well in which i &apos;m doing it by three seconds .
it &apos;s just that it has to process as a present .
then it goes into the past and so i can bridge very elegant , for example , on the computer , if i know this phenomenon .
what does it take to the nest milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
and also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time that you &apos;re in love with .
that means that , you know , a sense of pleasure , you &apos;re looking at who you look like long , because i don &apos;t get any gun for what &apos;s going to happen to happen .
and 16 milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time of most of the perceptions that we have .
this is what this first impression is happening in a rapidly fast speed , as we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at and how we kind of protect ourselves against our environment , so we can think of it as well .
of course , the creator of the script is not just the subject of perceptions and neural behavior or a matter of the subject of the subject of the world &apos;s topic .
so , like a human being , it &apos;s related to a certain thing .
there &apos;s a practical scale that &apos;s practical , so it &apos;s so different aspects or the other things .
there &apos;s a lot of time where i know exactly where i &apos;m going to get to the point .
but there &apos;s symbolic functions , why do someone have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a time where they &apos;re not going to do anything like that , so that they don &apos;t have any more potent , and even in fact ,
there are more to the kind of symbolic , on the average , which we &apos;re also concerned with as a creator .
back to my actual topic of natural users , and the theme of what &apos;s also natural , is the most important thing .
and the point is , how can i get a certain goal to do a certain goal or how can a user in a certain sense of energy can be effective , efficient and al-qaeda ?
so it &apos;s going to say the norm .
how can i do something about it ?
i can use that directly or i need to do the manual , or i need to do a little bit of a training training for it .
and less of the water or a little bit of it .
i &apos;m just making that different , and it doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s better to be more inclusive .
you have to understand that too .
and then if you &apos;re partly in part of the software that we &apos;ve seen , then you &apos;ll understand why ninety-nine percent of our current software is little intuitive or not in terms of the most intuitive , which is the most intuitive software , and it &apos;s actually
and in fact , intuitive is not just an intuitive marketing system for apple , and it &apos;s a fundamental problem , when i &apos;m just going to use technological equipment to do the human devices .
why ?
because in the rule of the world , we &apos;re using this new kind of design , which is the natural user , for example , at the average of our goal .
you have to imagine that if you do something of classical science , five hours , you need to take a new kind of natural software , just an hour of natural software .
that doesn &apos;t mean you can probably go home , but you can see your employer , or your employer , and you can see it , as he &apos;s doing with the four hours of it .
but i want to say that it &apos;s a more powerful tool for us , and it &apos;s also certain things .
so when we go back to the whole part of the software , here &apos;s the first time model interface that were very abstract , where you needed months to deal with these systems .
then the next , the next one , and the mental model , or mental model , have been working on the software , which is , you &apos;ve got a picture of something that &apos;s the metaphor of a desktop to make the computer to make a desktop .
so no longer zeros and ones or the water code , but just a metaphor .
and that &apos;s a lot of the time , but it &apos;s also much better , of course .
the next generation of graphics is working very much more with behavior .
so , i make a lot more often than a creator that looks like this .
this is also a paradigm shift .
so , i think that &apos;s always the way that i think that &apos;s going to be a application for success , just the most sophisticated one .
and then if i go to this natural user interface , the user user interface , where i &apos;m in the voice , by the way , by the way , by the way , by the gesture and the nerve , and not more than a mouse , i
but that &apos;s what leads me to the point , when are things going to be intuitive ?
if you become intuitive and then i have to get out of my little friend here , and see what does it mean to be a little bit intuitive , when is it really intuitive ?
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing for humans , and it &apos;s always something intuitive to us when i think about it .
so he doesn &apos;t like to think , but it just does it .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for designers ?
that means that if we look at that , we can transmit existing carbon systems from one on something , for example , the metaphor , i can use it as a creator .
so , i can actually put this an intuitive , human being on a software , and make the software significantly more powerful .
and of course , the question is , what is the most important thing about us , and now , i &apos;ve been telling you about it .
this is called the &quot; s &quot; .
it &apos;s using every one of us and the most powerful , and it &apos;s a acronym for addiction , and it &apos;s a nonprofit , and it &apos;s a lot of education .
it &apos;s all of you all the time , but it &apos;s kind of unconsciously , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive or partly .
the model is going to be a lot of time in the womb , and it &apos;s a lot of time , so it works in the world young and old , and it &apos;s used by us all the time without most of the time that most of the
and the other thing that &apos;s found about 50 to more , about 50 to more than the growth of us , is that you &apos;ve seen that you &apos;ve found it less often than the day , then , it &apos;s less often more common than the day .
i can now be able to take this mental pulse , and i &apos;m going to use , to be a , to be a design of the game , to be a more honest .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the design of the world &apos;s metaphor , now not more a metaphor of an physical object , but a metaphor of a design of a brain , one of the a design of a brain .
and this is on a higher grail of the most popular metaphor of the world &apos;s transmission , which is the most popular thing .
and if i &apos;m going to do this , for example , i &apos;m going to be a little bit of a time , and i &apos;m going to say , &quot; a little bit of a choice , &quot; to come up with it , and i can see
then i can transmit this whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to do this by one copy .
and it &apos;s a cake that everybody has eaten cake .
now , i &apos;m going to see , i can see , in terms of the object , again , to zoom back , zoom back .
i &apos;m going to get the whole whole way to filter this , and i can say , just to show me all of the things with chocolate for example .
and once on a time , a interface , which is much more intuitive and very much natural .
because , i can reach the things that can reach the bits , and they can come to me , and they &apos;re a lot of natural than that , when they can do the temporary organized websites or other mechanisms of these things .
imagination is more powerful , more sophisticated , and with this sentence , i like to close a and to give the hint , even designers , to think differently , to come to new solutions , and thank you very much for your attention and please .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first , if you &apos;re a kid , as a child , is that you &apos;re taking a place of what you have , yes ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed you to play more or less , the more , you know , the curiosity
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t get to learn .
so , all of that is , you know , these are the ones that are curious , and people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m going to do it now , basically , this whole whole , sort of , the whole , 40 years of power , in quality of the quality .
and there &apos;s a central point in this .
and it depends on phosphorus .
give a chance .
every day you give up , give them a scale of magnitude of the phosphorus , and every day you have to take two grams phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bones .
we could just zoom out as a nu-ca-ler by the air industry .
if we don &apos;t get a phosphorus , and we &apos;re going to make it .
amazingly , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re going to deal with something that &apos;s actually , in fact , a little bit of time , but not that .
because all talk about energy , but nobody &apos;s talking about the most sophisticated .
the key thing is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only got phosphorus and already now , through the world &apos;s atmosphere , and we &apos;ve been getting much more uranium in the world than all nuclear plants use in the environment .
in the last 20 years , the two thousand tons of uranium has been distributed to our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
it &apos;s doing leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , the environment , get less cars .
the environment , make less trash .
the environment , the more energy energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
this is like when i say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say your child , blow it up , just three times .
this is just a little bit less destruction .
if we think about the khyber to the back to the back of the world , our entire earth is used to or later a cemetery .
so , this is about the mutilated to the mutilated .
and the most important thing about this is to look at the ground as the first thing .
in the ground , over 60 percent of the u.s. war is stored .
now , we &apos;re building corn and losing between 11 and 30 kilograms of 30 pounds per hectare , or also on the square meter .
that means we &apos;re losing about five thousand times more than new , as new as new .
we can actually look at the most important thing .
and everything is packaging or content .
for example , in the middle of the 20 , the u.s. twenty percent of the world &apos;s population is repeated in the world .
and because we &apos;re getting older , the retrofits are getting bigger .
it &apos;s kind of like all of the most important .
yes ?
a baby needs about six of the mexican officers .
we could , of course , reduce 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is in a second called a balanced .
it &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we go with this buick ?
here &apos;s one of the proof of that , by the way , that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is being emitted in the pigs of the stable components of altruism .
people over the urine .
yeah .
so , you can &apos;t be pigs with that .
because this is what it is , right ?
we &apos;re in the general world , we &apos;re in the world , too many on the world .
and if you put the people that if you put it into the people when you say , that would be better , you &apos;re not there , you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a time and hostile .
and so someone like al gore says one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more powerful than the human population to stabilize .
in israel , you say , if you live a living life , you &apos;re going to be able to get the earth .
here it says , the more you &apos;re going to be the better .
yeah .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh about four more than we humans .
i could take termites , but in the united states , no one likes termites , in the way you &apos;re a vegetarian .
that means that ants weigh much more than we .
and because they &apos;re physically working harder than we &apos;re living and because they &apos;re only three to six months , they &apos;re going to be in their weight , in the energy energy , something 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you &apos;re looking at how far we &apos;re going to get , and how sad we are , and how sad we are , we can see that we &apos;re at all , you know , that we &apos;re going to be a program , right ?
you can only be more adept when you don &apos;t exist , right ?
the only chance .
have you seen a tree tree ?
yes ?
one single one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we &apos;re going to go to midnight as a trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is a tree .
not , yes , yes ?
there &apos;s no more a food system on trees .
there are still six billion trees still in the water room .
and you &apos;ve heard about the whole thing that you &apos;ve heard of from trees ?
that means all of our intelligence means that we &apos;re going to go to midnight as a trees .
and where you see , even in a little bit like 82 , the most elemental , economic growth , doesn &apos;t allow our own food back back .
we &apos;re losing three million tons every year that would have to go back to these cycles .
and we &apos;re too many .
alone , it &apos;s about it .
this is what we feel so guilty about on earth that we say , there &apos;s no standard , no more a , no sports , no more , no , no , and how they all allow that our own altruism go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , less harmful , which is using oil use .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it comes to the environment , the highest thing is not to be there ?
so , yes , yes ?
you can only have the only time you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot yourself , you would have emissions .
so they can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can back our nutrients back .
we &apos;re doing in brazil in brazil , where we bring nutrients back .
so , we can put it in the way nutrients and in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china for example , where we take right the waste of it .
in china , a more sophisticated one today is still a more sophisticated , kind of , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid , our nutrients in the state of california .
that means that the western state of the world is going to take out that the city has only taken out , but the farmers never have a return .
and so , the cities had to grow more , because the farmers were going to go to cities and they had to keep the cities further away .
so all the western rich are always expanding , until they don &apos;t have the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re in the hillside .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done a thousand of the civilization over five thousand years , because you &apos;ve always been able to lift nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat in china , you &apos;re expected to go to the food , that as long as you see the toilet .
because it &apos;s wagner to go and take nutrients .
you have them to get them to eat , not to the master .
that means you can see the internet , how to return the nutrients back .
it &apos;s actually beautiful , if you do that , so agriculture makes you , it &apos;s producing , you know , a hectare of land , in the favelas , with five thousand people in favelas , can produce a farmer and the pig and the pig and the
and the great thing about this is that the most powerful in the favelas around 12,000 percent is coming back .
so we don &apos;t have to control people , too much bad .
we can support them , good to be good .
that &apos;s natural , of course , but the plants carry themselves .
this byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by design , which is a farmer that can just operate .
that means that the most important thing is to go back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve been building over the last 20 years , in the last 20 years , not ever got a lot of these facilities .
you could easily easily put a liter of a liter and then be ruined over years .
don &apos;t find .
that means we don &apos;t need to control the people , too much bad .
we can support them , good to be good .
that means we need to have phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you &apos;re going to write in germany , in germany , the best treatment of treatment in the world .
unfortunately , not in the street , but maybe you can help the most important thing to do with this .
because the most important thing could be the phosphorus &apos;s phosphorus .
and that has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s really working .
we &apos;ve been using the fact that we &apos;ve used over three years now .
the dutch government has explained , you &apos;ll be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need that overall .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s land .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of the things that opec is .
these are the countries that control 40 percent of the u.s. consumption .
and the oil is going to be replacing by other energy channels .
but the phosphorus is not able to replace it .
it &apos;s not about making the existing one less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s really a question to ask , what is the right thing ?
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
in holland , of course , you understand easier because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if you &apos;re sad for example , if you &apos;re unhappy , if you have her , and you come to 50 virgins .
completely inefficient .
but , in fact , it &apos;s effective , right ?
or take a continuous patch .
a woman in germany eats about six kilograms of the world &apos;s life .
and it &apos;s .
that &apos;s not exactly the exact right thing that &apos;s not right because we don &apos;t know how much more powerful is going to be .
but a continuous , even at this lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but all right , right ?
it &apos;s a whole thing that &apos;s beautiful in life , it &apos;s not efficient .
it &apos;s not a resource resource , but efficiency .
questions about what is the right ?
not , the more important to burn a little bit better and to keep it on the ground and lose the whole materials for these strands , but first to ask how to do these cycles ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i put them up to dinner , and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with a little glass of water and a glass of water .
wonderful , right ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything in life is beautiful , it &apos;s not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , you get efficient ?
yes ?
that means all of what &apos;s going on in life , is not to save it , to avoid reducing .
all the water systems .
we say , &quot; yeah , you don &apos;t have a green in the south . &quot;
no , the throw away exactly the right thing , yes ?
in every place , where you &apos;re going to get away from , you can get back to the point of time .
but the wrong things .
if you &apos;re going to make the wrong things , you have a laser file .
as we think of north .
there &apos;s any footprint there .
if you walk , you &apos;re killing the ground .
because the land is going to die , and the wind and the water washing away the soil .
but if you &apos;re in italy , any footprint means that the water is going to be longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that &apos;s going to be a marsh .
not a fool .
we say in germany , sustainability .
yes ?
but if i ask you , how about you , what about your wife ?
what then do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; yes , huh ?
this is just the minimum .
so not saving , keep it .
every waste is essential .
and it &apos;s a lust , if you see in italy , like the people in the high bow , and they &apos;re looking at it , so that &apos;s what coke &apos;s like to do .
because you know , this is a kind of a business process .
it &apos;s a form of design , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
we have developed a design sample , for example , in room temperature , which is at temperature temperature .
you can wheel where you go and stand .
in two hours , they build all over the place .
and it contains seeds of rare plants , so they &apos;re going to address the biodiversity that they &apos;re going to solve .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so it &apos;s two cycles .
not all of you should be non-humans .
a television or a washing machine , which is just using them , they don &apos;t use them .
just the things that are the most important , like the coal , like the sound of sound , like the sound of sound , that you have to go to biology , that you have to go to biological systems .
things that are used only to go in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the design of the day , right ?
so direct ads , and not to puma by the company , but for the company that they &apos;re now helping this company to make these products successful .
because we don &apos;t do the things that we do .
yes ?
so , if i go to the food and say , that &apos;s free from the internet , then you don &apos;t help it .
no , we &apos;re stuck in what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like the main
not toxic in it .
it &apos;s all in that in it , it &apos;s useful .
these are the first shoes they can get off the board of the mountain and can go out and go out and go out and go out of biological galaxies , right ?
everything is a preference of it .
and if it &apos;s working , of course , we &apos;re working for rehabilitation , for nike , for the food industry and the whole industry industry .
and this is half of all the world &apos;s most violent , which is caused by the textile industry .
so , that &apos;s why they help you ask , ask people to ask .
hey , agarikon , do you make it seriously ?
because now , they &apos;ve changed twice the most sophisticated .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really do it .
so , let me help you a little bit .
but it &apos;s going .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been shown right now .
this is what it goes .
we can do things so that if they break , if they break , they can be able to be in biological settings .
technical loops are just as well .
there &apos;s a direct diagnostic problem for this .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , that &apos;s made back in the circulation .
so , in every store , you can do things like that .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the back of the page of that ?
if you &apos;re in the right right now , the waste is .
all over the place , all of these things are around , almost .
in the countries where people are coming to money .
there &apos;s a second on the street , but also in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastics , so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the world &apos;s energy , that they can just go back to the ground , then you can plant with a baby in israel or in tunisia .
yes ?
if you take this back , you &apos;re taking this back , you &apos;re picking up , you &apos;re picking up , sterile and the powder to plant the trees .
so the baby is the whole life for the whole life , already from beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be more inclusive , we can be more populous .
it &apos;s kind of a design print drawing .
yeah , so , sort of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can even reinvent everything .
i started a institute to do this .
now , there are lots of people working with it , and they can all be engaged .
there &apos;s a group of a group of a group of people who can come up with each other .
so not saving , it &apos;s not to prevent , avoid reducing , not a more powerful , but smart waste .
does it make you curious ?
thank you .
the work of the design system .
music as language .
in the description to my talk , i was written as a computer designer , as a sign of myself , so in english , so in english , i understand .
and the story of the written is the written language in a little bit more clear music .
that you don &apos;t just have to get a word in a different language for word the text in another language , but also the deeper sense of the words and the other , and you have to understand it , so everyone who has a useful translation , everybody
now , using the german in english , you can also have to know more knowledge , especially if you &apos;re about poetry or at least about poetry .
but it &apos;s very alien to the terms of terms of terms of what we do with our primary group .
and as a designer , i first got the written notes in the first way .
you think that the composer has just been in the notes in the notes , which he has imagined .
in fact , the notes are very vague and causal .
these notes are about as much as the resemblance or the resemblance , as a verbal language , as well as it &apos;s very seemingly accurate , description of a landscape .
because in this verbal desire , the smell of flowers is not to smell the amount of the water , the degree of the light of the world &apos;s energy , not to hear the average of the world &apos;s disease .
this is , the aristotelian court has to be the first part of the ted project in a different , which is a different , concrete , non-verbal , non-verbal , non-verbal .
today i want to tell you what i &apos;m using to translate to , so , again , in a verbal language , again , in a verbal language .
so , basically a translation of translation .
so i &apos;m going to pull it up , and i &apos;d like to do it all the way to the german , because if i &apos;ve had to translate it into english , it would be translated to me the translation of translation .
so the music is so similar to me , as much as the spoken language .
the main notes have the function of the letters of a script .
so it won &apos;t be just to learn to learn the notes and press the buttons on the piano or the right place on a mouse table .
and that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
you can see the point of the letters , you can only see the language .
so , you need to have the learning process of music at least as long as the spoken language .
there &apos;s also a heterosexual , whether you learn it for the most sophisticated , just passive , or you can also talk to the musical speaker , to the musical speaker .
the work of the design process starts like the one of the most sophisticated .
after first , after you &apos;ve chosen a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re going to be able to get your way to the emergence of the composition of the composition .
you collect information about the piece of the play .
you read in the letters , you &apos;re reading notes , notes , or whether you think of the thought of composers itself .
you studied the works that he &apos;s been interviewing before and after .
you think of it .
the motives , it &apos;s to write .
how and what did he feel ?
how were the life of the society and the politics ?
all of this is interested in me .
you think in this time , by looking at contemporary images , or you &apos;re reading literature .
but you have a while , but you &apos;ve also seen an expert known as an interpreter to the composers you play once , and it &apos;s always easier to feel in it and feel it .
the composer is always going to be more to the friend of the world .
his cause , to write the piece , is always more and more to my personal concerns , to play .
so , there &apos;s all other people &apos;s notes than a really accurate record of the composer , but just a framework , i &apos;m now going to turn this framework to it to make sense and meaning and meaning .
i then say to my own words , what could be written between this framework .
i play the way that they could have these notes .
now for me , and what you &apos;re going to do now and what you might mean today might be .
every note , every phrase you get a sense , because i feel it , because it &apos;s made of my own personal , it &apos;s now coming out of my own .
it has to be in this , and now , i &apos;m going to be a little bit of my audience , and i can &apos;t convince my audience that my cause is .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , and i have a very happy concert , and i have the idea that i &apos;ve been working on the verge of seeing the piece that i &apos;ve been doing so long .
and as you ever saw a happy new day , even though it was with the same rituals of life , and , like , breakfast , go to work , i also go to the same piece of time .
i &apos;ve become older again , the seasons change , my pulse goes slower at the evening as a morning , in a auditorium , takes it longer than home .
i &apos;m going to breathe the audience , consciously , or unconsciously .
all of this affects me and all the impacts of my experience with the composition .
so , it &apos;s also a very wonderful thing when i stand up with a little bit of a time on the stage and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , more dignified conversation .
you get a new idea in and in spite of that answer , this answers is a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting because then things that we haven &apos;t calculated , and what you can &apos;t do is not even samples .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to make music , and they have the audience , and then they &apos;ve seen the music as it communicates alive .
so every concert is a different concert .
i &apos;ll never play more like this at this moment .
i can &apos;t play this way in 20 years today .
and i &apos;m going to have more life experience than today and will be much more of the palette of the internet , and the more powerful , and emotion , and emotion as today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some more sophisticated things , but i &apos;m going to have a new kind of storage .
have a nice kind of thing to do that .
it was on a computer street for my beloved old teacher , professor of the former , a famous school professor , a famous school designer , a famous school company , and a lot of time in the world &apos;s office .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so he was already a lot of time to study when i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortune , and i was very early , and i was very early at 13 years , and i was on his school classes .
i was 17 , when i went back to one of his courses , and played the last one of the four journals of chopin , a computer writer .
he asked me what the introduction of this kind of baby was .
this is a kind of a secret part .
and in my favorite , i said , expectation .
and he said , &quot; and he said , &quot; so ?
that &apos;s the point of the world .
because for me , she &apos;s memory .
he was already over 60 .
well , with 17 , you just have a dreams , but no significant memories .
i play the piece of time today , and i &apos;ve been going to have it , although it has changed for me , even though not a single note .
every time it &apos;s exciting , i always read something new .
one example of a whole different area . wham has painted the most powerful thing .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different nights , in the middle of the light .
he &apos;s translated the water &apos;s license , so it &apos;s seen as it has seen in this moment , like you &apos;re looking at it .
his personal family model of the world &apos;s population .
the most common interpretation of a piece is comparable .
now , i &apos;m also older than a chopin , and it &apos;s been like the song .
he &apos;s lived in a living situation .
and it &apos;s important to look at the notes again , even though i &apos;m able to do it , you can quit .
to keep the bus , right with composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially when he died .
now , how do you start talking to the language of music ?
i said , you know , you need about the same for the spoken language .
and often the most important thing is , you &apos;re just learning the notes .
you &apos;re actually learning the reading , you &apos;re just talking about the one word .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument on the instrument .
and when all the fingers are in time and right , like it &apos;s in the notes , then sound comes out , and then sound sounds like music .
if that &apos;s accurate , the students get the same piece .
it &apos;s not talking about interpretation of the game .
well , there &apos;s a very fast thing to do that , which is a quick piece .
it &apos;s slow , slowly .
according to the and the gold , f and b , etc .
and that &apos;s what most of you are here .
but even if you translate this data , it &apos;s still just a technical project .
and yet it &apos;s not always a interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget something very much about it .
because , to make music on the instrument , that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be about to be a musical suit .
that &apos;s what the singing is .
a child who doesn &apos;t learn that , because it doesn &apos;t have the parents to do it , it &apos;s not going to be done by itself .
this is like the most important .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of music to get it over another possibility , so to make a sound , to sound about a tool .
people who never sing , they never felt a very immediate body , so it &apos;s a tone of being able to form a tone .
a phrase with your own breath .
the computer network is the extension of our body .
our vocal officials sing our hands , our hands and feet to dance .
so the piano is the sequel in the piano of my fingers .
the tune comes from the surface of the body and the rhythm of the dance .
the irregular of the world today is not really inspired with music .
you don &apos;t need to make music more even if it gets bored .
no longer need to whistle a bicycle machine or singing .
every single music is going to be medicalized when you &apos;re going to be able to get out of music with music .
sure , there are some of you who say yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t sing ?
the question i can &apos;t sing you , is a , because you believe that you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they don &apos;t have learned to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to figure out whether they can &apos;t , or learn how to do this little muscles that the vocal vocal vocal vocal officials are doing , right .
so , you can train this .
or c , because you have to get it to you , that you &apos;re a little bit more populous .
so , i &apos;m going to ask , how do you see how much more competent was this diagnosis ?
have you got a little bit of a design or a computer program , like you &apos;re going to say beautiful today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and therefore , you don &apos;t want to do anything to do with it .
but what i &apos;d like to do is , you know , that i &apos;m going to be a beautiful , and it &apos;s a beautiful thing , and it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
but maybe you can also do it more well .
well , you can see , all the cases , no one has to be an candidate candidate .
but please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand the classical music .
i can &apos;t say if it &apos;s good or bad .
i &apos;m saying , but surely you can say , &quot; you know , it &apos;s like you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says , &quot; i don &apos;t know if it tastes , because i can &apos;t cook . &quot;
so , it doesn &apos;t help to eat it , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to keep out music , because you don &apos;t play a instrument .
listen to you , and say , if it tastes , or not .
whether music is to you or too sweet .
tell that what you feel .
and you can also get an standards with the time and want to get something more spices there or taste some nice differences .
why am i asking now from my audience that it also listening to the active ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate there .
a piece of artwork you never look at has a force .
the food , which was made by a chef or a chef , has to be eaten , and not just looking at recipes .
so please listen to a music .
it &apos;s not just a nice thing .
if in a environment where adults are actively actively hearing music or at least they hear a child , a child is growing up , then it &apos;s very easy to ask for a little bit of the time , to ask the color of your flower ?
can you also play me in blue ?
and the child is playing , after a computer , rather than a red flower , a blue flower .
and this sounds very different from the time .
this was the first beginning of a musical expression of expression .
so the first step to a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece of this , the first one before a hundred , before two hundred or two years ago , is before three years ago ?
and now the instruments have evolved .
there was no piano at all , and there was no piano at all .
it was not just invented .
i think the stream would have been excited if he had the verbal opportunity of the modern world &apos;s own life .
i can now get the most sophisticated , which has been able to make the stream on the modern wing , which is not a standard of a design system .
and also , by beethoven , you know that he had been hearing more than deaf .
today , modern orchestra is able to play everything that has been a orchestra from then as a symbol of the back .
so the composers are dependent on us , which are making the pieces of the pieces .
so they &apos;re going to penetrate what they &apos;ve been thinking about in the spirit .
and also , what you would think in the spirit today .
or what i &apos;m going to do today is because what you might have thought about .
thank you .
you know what &apos;s envy ?
were they even sandals ?
and how did this feel ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a rubber machine .
when i come to the , with my little v w , and i &apos;m going to go back to this feeling .
i take something through the head .
i say , &quot; what do you need to do so much car ? &quot;
and that &apos;s what it does , for the first year , that &apos;s the number of value .
and at all , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to afford to do a little bit of a car ?
and then immediately , i &apos;m going to take a breath .
it &apos;s about justice .
and as i say the word justice , this awkward feeling is going to be .
our organism has invented a great way to get such a uncomfortable emotion like envy .
you can also try that with words like revenge or your own folk or some things .
i want to explain to you with this mechanism today or something that &apos;s very much very appealing to you .
the mechanism comes from lying .
but think about the lie of the lie you may have heard , if people say nobody &apos;s going to have a wall .
and then stone stones , so he &apos;s going to take a test test .
in a lie like this , you see that the liars doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to check out the light that is very different in the sense of it .
he just makes you think , and not yourself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , that has to do with it , that they &apos;re fooled .
they need a lie to get a bribe to a self-deception .
you can make less easy , yes , you can break it down , and you can rotate .
they need time .
from this time , a anecdote is a anecdote that you might know .
the spanish painter fell once a woman &apos;s name .
and this woman ended up complaining about her portrait , not quite like you .
picasso &apos;s saying , wait just .
it &apos;s always going to be more similar to them .
and at this point , and when you laugh , you see how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience something , what artists can tell us very well .
because artists have an old-fashioned relationship to lie .
the artist gives you something with , and especially this lady , what you don &apos;t see when you just look at the mirror .
the artist will share you in such a portrait , something that you &apos;re going to be familiar with when you &apos;re going to look at this piece of work .
then this awkward feeling , it can &apos;t be like you can &apos;t see it , and it will always be more similar to you .
here you have this mechanism that we can use as a great invention to the heart of our health system .
and not only in art , in the world , in the mythology , in the mythology , it comes back to the future .
you may know this idea of the lady , who looked at every morning in the mirror and asked him who is the most beautiful in the entire country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a little bit of a time .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this true put , also , can &apos;t lie from that true set of applause .
but we should just make sure that you can &apos;t tell a woman , that there &apos;s a little bit different in a different way .
here &apos;s what we need to understand , which is what we &apos;re doing under the ground of the world .
we need this lie to this lie that we have to protect ourselves without the one we can &apos;t live .
we don &apos;t just have the art of the art , in the science of the world , but also in science , such great lies .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s story of the u.s. war .
she heard about this book of charles darwin , the emergence of the species and the people of the people .
that the person from the monkeys should be , and yes , at least there would be a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then they ran them to her husband and said , &quot; well , it &apos;s not true , what charles da da da . &quot;
the human one is to have a common ancestor or a shared ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent that people know that they are going to know .
why do we prevent that people know about something if it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live without these things .
because we &apos;re this self-deception , this feeling , great to be the highest creatures , not from one such as a kind of a organism , from something like a organism that has still existed , and the same thing that &apos;s going to be , like , a
so , we can &apos;t deal with these things .
we have to prevent that people are going to know about things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you see how slowly this mechanism is coming out and how the traces look like the traces that he &apos;s leaving on something else than that great picture of ourselves , i want to show you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , like i &apos;m .
my wife told me she was telling me .
she came from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told her about a student .
a student student .
you like it particularly , because he has a slope to the microscopic .
and she asked him what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire department .
and because i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in making things .
yes , you &apos;re going to feel it if you &apos;re fed up on this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i said , i said , &quot; if a man in a moral summary , that &apos;s because they &apos;re used to the most , we should try and replace it through the oil system .
and you do that once and then you know the sentence .
although i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in making things .
you feel that &apos;s the actual truth behind the following .
so a little bit of a little bit of a time , which is not interested in the ground .
the interest is the interest .
but there &apos;s no clubs that we can look around where you can learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the second second , the fire spill .
he &apos;s got it signed .
and you can &apos;t say , you know , you don &apos;t say , you know , you &apos;re going to put your teacher somewhere , you &apos;re going to be able to get your fires somewhere and you &apos;re excited about the fire later .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of the dangers that the other , the other one , if you put fire on it .
here you have this little mechanism .
these are the most important things that we &apos;ve seen in the heart of the world &apos;s brain , that it &apos;s actually related to the fire , but that it can &apos;t say it .
here you have this kind of little , very ambitious between the unconscious and the conscious , which goes up , without that they can do something about it , and the things that you know is that they can look very different , so they can make a lot
so , just these words that we &apos;re using in the language of the political correct of the human rights .
we actually know that something else is the case .
but we know if we &apos;re talking about this , the social narrative is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to do things in a society that should work , to present .
now i want to describe you , what we found in my institute .
after which logic , these self-deception , the willingness , the willingness to make a different reality than that , from which we actually know , is to spread out .
i want to show you two , maybe three examples of it .
the first example is ahead of what many of you know and some of you appreciate , very few of them don &apos;t even need .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is so much intellectual , say about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not about stop , natural nature .
and if you have people who are the most powerful belief that they have a soul , or you can also say , the belief that they &apos;ve been given from the soul to life , then they &apos;re just like the soul of the brain , and they &apos;re
and from this soul , you think that you &apos;re somehow in this 30-year nature , in this particular process of nature , which is called the latin , the middle of the latin , the present , is the present .
and when this particular one is going to be over the people , then it &apos;s filled with dignity , with the spirit , with nature that can only live , right with soul .
and then he can just be a dent .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so you should go from the outside to the people .
so we should be able to see them as something that &apos;s really meant to present our lives .
and if you have this assumption , you understand the logic that we &apos;re experiencing , that we can do this happiness through a lie of our world .
because now you can apply a nuclear record .
you know , it &apos;s a lot of time from school .
now this is a very reactive thing that describes us a logic .
this is the hardest part in my talk .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
so , to lie that you can just use this logic wrong .
in this particular case , three sentences come from .
the first sentence is , it &apos;s not a soul , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if you have a right , it doesn &apos;t have a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i actually covered him here .
a third sentence , which shows immediately in people who have a strong sense of a soul .
the people say who has no soul , is dead and can &apos;t claim anything .
and here you feel it .
here &apos;s the logic in this , yes , in this talk , to expression .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re logical .
i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell you about the reality of reality .
i can say , the most powerful is a man .
and if i have right , the most powerful one is a man .
if i don &apos;t have the right , the most powerful is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell you what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but critical , if i have right , it &apos;s a lot of it .
so if you say , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical correctly .
and now our consciousness is now feeling the conscious awareness of it , and you can do something .
it &apos;s a third sentence that has nothing to do with the first two sentences and that &apos;s what it does , as if the first sentence is already proven and accepted .
because actually , we have to prove whether there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that just uses that two sentences are accurate , and a third of the second , which looks like it would have been doing something to do with so , we can save our food systems .
so , we do as if it &apos;s actually impossible to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue these things to do different examples .
in the present , we have a very modern example of that , which keeps the most sophisticated .
and you have to imagine another philosophical subject , a computer model from philosophy , present present .
and that &apos;s what we do with the fact that we go back into the street .
there was a scholars that was called johannes , and after that , the most prolific of the argentine , named the biophony .
the most prolific of the biophony is a bacchanal , which is made out of pure nature .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
this is a kind of a design model .
and if you place the exact right in the middle between two , it &apos;s going to be a lot of time .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a haystack he should first go .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
so the first is the first time .
the power of the forces with the food system is to solve each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
just if you get another example , so if you immediately do a haystack , then it doesn &apos;t need reason and nothing to do it .
automatically , he &apos;s going to be the right idea .
so if you have this idea that you &apos;re being driven in nature , you &apos;re going to be driven by the larger pile that are wearing a instantly , you have the feeling that it has to give you a free will .
and if we &apos;re in the middle of the mountain , i remember the most important thing for brain science .
there &apos;s a scholars that says wolf , and it &apos;s a wolf , and you sometimes say , wolf , there &apos;s no free .
now we can create the second sentence , and we can say , if wolf is right , he doesn &apos;t have free free .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can do now in the daily newspaper is to find it in this third sentence .
and it looks like that , who doesn &apos;t have free free , can &apos;t be pulled for his actions and claims , and it &apos;s so much more sophisticated .
and again , they have it again .
and actually , you have to prove to be able to prove whether there &apos;s something like free .
but the logic of deception allows us to do that as if the first sentence was wrong by the first place , as you would have to think of the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just do anything if you want to test anything , if you want to test anything , and you &apos;re all going to do , if you want to make people happy , that courage to fight .
so , for example , practice , if you &apos;re going to meet a human being , you can say there &apos;s no standard .
and please use the german word for the word of the word , which is the prophet .
it doesn &apos;t call them , that would be a little more politically political .
say , there &apos;s no standard .
immediately they &apos;re going to be one , for granted , that they can &apos;t prove that , you know , you can &apos;t prove .
and they &apos;ve got a problem .
because while they &apos;re busy , they &apos;re not able to prove that there is no way to be able to be a man , the man is happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s fooled .
because he has led them to a red collection that he &apos;s not focused on itself .
because actually , this man is not interested in evidence .
it &apos;s just interested in the fact that it &apos;s going to be more interested in the need to prove that there are a lot of time .
so , in the way the evidence of the evidence is , you see the brilliance of lying .
and once you have a chance to feel this kind of thing , this kind of thing that you do in other people , you do it , because you &apos;re going to make other happy if you don &apos;t remember them in the way that you don &apos;t remember
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;ve allowed myself to have a question of that i can mention it .
she &apos;s one of the most amazing things here from this great event , and i asked myself if i wanted to give a talk and my idea .
i have to say , you have to say , you &apos;ve got it , you know , it &apos;s hard to talk about my idea .
and i may be able to imagine my favorite , i &apos;m trying to imagine you .
but it &apos;s the sum of the way , of course , all of the ideas .
i probably , you know , are the two nice girls still , i probably become the generation that &apos;s been present for this bad image of image because i &apos;ve been starting to study robotic engineering , engineering , engineering , i think , i think , i think
and i was going to go back to berlin , and i was going to go to berlin , because i wanted to do renewable energy and i didn &apos;t have it in the street .
there was the most important thing .
the british and the united states was all the most important , the u.s.
the hot name today .
because a good engineer has either built a great car or a little bit of control .
but this kind of thing that &apos;s like &quot; n &quot; -- from a hundred watts from the square meter , that was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy piece of water .
i &apos;m grateful to say that he has the word again , because after the most important , you could not use the word anymore because everything left was bad .
but it wasn &apos;t that in the u.s. age of the year .
there was just that there was a lot of time that was made , and one of them was sitting in the street in the department of the room where you thought that was evil .
and the place of the design system , but that was called the &quot; s , &quot; and it was made wind and it was made in the mid- &apos; 80s .
and yes , a lot of what was said today , i &apos;m very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very common expressions that i &apos;ve lived in .
i worked in the collective , which was a lot of time .
we were 20 people .
if one no said , the most important thing was , the most powerful thing that i have had a very , very hard thing to do , i have a hard time to do it , whether i could really do my great job of a little bit of
it &apos;s busy with insanity .
and that was really very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , a picture of a pig where i asked myself to have a couple of years , a thousand
and i then have to go to the front of the street , and then we &apos;ve become a platonic company , and then i &apos;ve become a platonic company , which is then the most important of the largest world &apos;s largest largest , of the world &apos;s largest
a key thing , but also , of course , we have the problem of a growing company and we have a little bit of a group , and we decided that we &apos;re going to start with small and go back and go back and think of the next
and i brought you a project that i &apos;d like to introduce you to now .
and the title of talking was , yes , how to get a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started to ask a relatively , very much of a time story , where could you use a memory for a while today .
on this island , that &apos;s the island of the island on the ground .
yes , these are the data .
there are four thousand people living .
now , they have a renewable energy system from 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
it &apos;s just technological not .
if you put more wind together , the system starts failing .
i &apos;m always telling the politicians if they &apos;re in the middle of our facility .
and then the answer is , why ?
we &apos;ve already got 20 percent in germany .
but can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have seven percent , and our network is physically seen the european .
if we had in europe , we had the same problems that people have on this island , there &apos;s been the same problems .
the question was simple , and i was just starting to get the first contacts with the island , but just start to calculate through .
as big as the big one , because it &apos;s a battery , so you have to be a island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and yes , i go again to a slide .
the conventional system looks like this in the world .
by the way , a year , a year , a year , about a hundred gigawatts , electric performance on the world .
that &apos;s the performance of a hundred nuclear power nuclear power , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the world &apos;s most important thing that &apos;s happening is that it &apos;s deleted with juarez because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s fast .
you &apos;re so in a box .
and then it looks like this .
in the run , three of the people are always waiting for two .
yeah , so this is the bottom of the road .
we also have very precise data .
and the solar system or whatever it is , is in the rule of a system , or a system , which can only be put into small amounts of light here .
our goal was to say , okay .
the peanut is going to be a little bit of the wind and the wind , the sun , the burden that you can map the larger proportion .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , energy per year , not the performance in the moment , you have to turn off the peanut .
and that means that at the moment , you have to worry that renewables can take energy in the entire net .
and of course , you can only get it out of a way of getting out of this kind of thing .
that &apos;s not what nobody did on the world .
there &apos;s a little bit of the style , so you can also use your car &apos;s car on a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
people always ask me what they &apos;re doing , because they &apos;re actually in the middle of the room ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
but if you want to get multiple of these online cells , and you want to build a net , that &apos;s going to be extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to come up to 70 percent renewable percent renewable and then there &apos;s this rest of the rest that last 10 , 20 percent renewable , which will be very , very expensive , and that will not work , that you can
it will be a fuel fuel , which is , then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , or sh , that will be , then it will be .
you have to go to a more , and you &apos;re not just going to make it a little bit of a time and not just touch .
we just wanted to know what is because of a normal , scalable solar battery .
how far do you get there ?
and then , you know , a whole lot of simulation did .
and have wind and sun and the burden and the burden of the world came to the conclusion , a very interesting outcome that you have to go to the conventional system , which is about 50 cents a mile that takes about 50 cents a mile .
these were the very first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
so , it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the most sophisticated , when the average age of five percent per year goes up .
and then we started to negotiate with the most sophisticated .
what would everything be done ?
have investors with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new design projects .
we were only five people at the time , to get a new society to society .
and here &apos;s the representation .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green is our system .
so , our system also has a more powerful , because we &apos;re still 20 percent of the time , and we don &apos;t have a more , very much more than 20 percent of the other stuff .
and the most important , the most popular that that &apos;s going to do on the island , is that we find that very great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t think you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , where we can sort of map the electrical narrative in the island of the island in the scale of one .
so , we &apos;re looking for a first number of the world to find the largest battery in the world .
here she is .
it &apos;s actually coming from asia , which is the case of japan .
and it &apos;s a bbc &apos;s &apos; 70s , and it &apos;s been developed in the &apos; 70s today , and it &apos;s been developed , and then it &apos;s been developed in the japanese .
it &apos;s you can see it &apos;s a very , very big battery .
she has a megawatts of accomplishment and can take six hours for six hours , and that &apos;s the battery that we have sort of like a little bit of the time .
and then they set up .
we also have one of these most amazing things in the same size , as he &apos;s there , where the hall is actually in order to actually make the complete dynamic behavior of this web , so in the hall , the corridor is now , here , the
over here , we &apos;re going to simulate all the most sophisticated things that the cable , the cable , to sort of display the web in the net .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we can also put in two kilowatts of blobs on the web .
here we see again , we see the peanut again , again , the whole one , single one of the individual .
and what we did since the last time was the hall then finished , until today , it was kind of a lot of what &apos;s going on between the individual system of electronics , in software , we did .
so we &apos;re not a more powerful , but we define ourselves as a company that is just between the subject battery and the theme of the web , and everything in between .
you have to communicate to the battery , you have to communicate in the net , and you can also communicate in the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is that you &apos;re basically in this island , which is basically the most important thing to do today , that we &apos;re going to get the problems that we get when we want to increase our share of renewables .
so this whole discussion , as it is going back , and the same , the way that you should go to the island , we have to have a little bit of the way to do this for the island of the island , for example , to 30
and then , you know , the math is going to be a lot of time .
so , a computer bank , a water game everywhere .
we can start to start to integrate it to the island , to integrate , to be able to do it , because the burden , you can manage .
that means if you &apos;re in 70 percent renewable , you don &apos;t can do that without memory .
you can go through n , you can take the nets , you can see the nets , yes , that should be done in any case , the percentage of the body , but you can never fully get rid of memory .
and that &apos;s a little bit of the message .
so many people come and look at this , because you can see , because you can see what you get .
if we turn down the peanut , you don &apos;t have that spinning mass , which is caused a certain inertia in the net .
and our favorite media system is basically just rotating mass of large power , where the wave is all over europe , all over europe .
we look at this web , see the 50 hertz , and when it &apos;s nine hertz , we start a few of the things that we &apos;re going to do , and then we &apos;ll start a little bit of a little bit of a steam filter , then
this is the system .
and of course , this is incredibly high .
if you &apos;re in a little bit of a while , it &apos;s a little bit of time .
the main regulation of the regulation of the reserve has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in time , they can respond to other people .
if you don &apos;t have that , this spinning mass , you have to replace it with the light of light and the water .
and we can do this big battery two milliseconds once .
and then you see what enormous amounts of information there is .
and the message is , we need to put out on this rotating mass if we kind of like our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 , 30 percent and so on , if we want to reach the ones .
then we have to break down our energy capacity in the net .
so , the power of the power is simply running , and it &apos;s going to keep the power power .
yes , this is a very , very clear thing , in the moment , of the most cosmopolitan , because we don &apos;t do it , or it &apos;s not because it &apos;s not .
and we &apos;re just trying to make it realize that you can get the capacity to break down the capacity , to break down the surface of the grid .
so , fortunately , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies now .
and then , in this purpose , people are always coming and look at our own , sort of , our primary system , basically , our primary system .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far you can get a piece of future there .
and many discussions i had in the last six years , like the discussion i had in the last 30 years , for the theme of the last 30 years .
it &apos;s not a , is insanity , you have a lot of punch , you know , we &apos;re never going to get it .
we &apos;ve got 30 gigawatts now in germany .
this is a little bit of a time .
and i just go from that , in the next 30 years , that we &apos;re going to store the same capacity in ambient temperatures throughout the world .
just just that it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s a whole lot of the data of the world &apos;s dna and arguments .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve been seeing in the last two years , that the scientists are going to be on my side .
we &apos;ve now got over 10 million species of water , also to get into the german web now .
this is going to be in april april .
so , you know , from that , you also realize that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s just from that kind of band-aid to the idea , to the idea of a hundred percent renewable .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a solar system .
so far , in discussions , we &apos;re trying to do this kind of thing that &apos;s going to do , which is a little bit of a web that has nothing to do with our own body .
the question is , if you &apos;re completely , if you &apos;re completely independent from some fossil or a little bit of a fossil , which will be stuck somewhere on the world and you &apos;re going to be a island .
then they just use what &apos;s going on in the sun and wind there , where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a design supply , and i &apos;m grateful to be grateful that they &apos;ve been able to use solar energy .
and this is what we do , and that &apos;s where we &apos;re going to get the talk of the internet , that you can be a collective and use solar energy , here &apos;s a little bit together .
and yeah , i want to just encourage you to get a little bit of a crazy sense of mind , and you can be a little bit crazy , and also a vision .
and you really have to stay quite tough to stay in , but i think it &apos;s going to be .
thank you .
when steve lopez , the los angeles times , the los angeles times , went through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , talented , modest , homeless , homeless on a violin that had only two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from the other of the paper , it was a book that was called the &quot; north african &quot; and jamie lopez , and jamie lopez , and jamie lopez , who was at the most high age , was being
nathaniel left psychiatrists , suffered a breakdown and 30 years later , he lived as homeless at the streets of the street of los angeles .
i recommend reading all of you , and looking at the film , so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that came between these two men , but also how the music was allowed to get this connection , and that was the kind of a pun ,
i met mr. atwood in 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney hall .
he had just heard of beethoven first , and the fourth symphony , and came out behind the stage to imagine me .
he spoke in a very troubled and a very , very clear note about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and , as the dodgers would never create it in the baseball world series , and that &apos;s the most exciting passage of beethoven &apos;s fourth violin .
we came to talk to music about the subject , and a few days later , i got an email in which nathaniel was interested in me for the most important time .
i have to mention that nathaniel was an medical treatment , because he was already with electric and with the speed of light and a contractor and a trauma , a trauma that has been tracking him all his life .
as a result , he &apos;s particularly vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases , and they &apos;re sometimes so bad , and he disappears for days , in the streets of the world &apos;s land , always the horror and the most cosmopolitan of his own mind .
and in exactly a business of a summer , nathaniel was when we started with our first class in the walt disney hall , and he had this crazy man &apos;s name in his eyes and he was doing it completely lost .
he talked about invisible formal and smoke and about how to poison someone in the sleep .
i was afraid not to be able to be able to get it , but i was afraid that he could sink into one of his circumstances and that i could break him his relationship to the violin , if i started talking about scale and the other exciting forms
so i just started playing .
i was playing the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s first sentence .
and while i was playing , i fell in the eyes of a complete change , and i was going to be a complete change .
it was as if he was under the impact of an invisible drug , a chemical response , which was a catalyst to my game .
and the other thing that was found was , in a quiet curiosity , in understanding , in a quiet curiosity and grace .
and as he took a miracle , he took his violin and started playing some clips of the computer , and then i asked me to play , and i &apos;d like to go to play , you know , i &apos;d like to play , you know , i
we started talking about music , starting from bach , and the stream of beethoven , threw up , and all the other people , from the other , of the other , from the north of the sun .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t only know about music , but it was also a very close personal relationship with it .
he talked about her with a passion and an understanding that i could know from my colleagues in the moma section of los angeles .
by playing music and talked about music , from this kind of thing , was a confused man , a confused man , who was just in the streets of los angeles , a computer , a great , great , great , in dereck trained musicians .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means emotional health .
because the music allows him to , his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in something real .
and so he &apos;s the kind of his continual state .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
this is the reason why we do music : so we do something that &apos;s in all of us deep in the inside , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity , to reality .
and the reality of this expression is that we all get , and we &apos;re moving , and we &apos;re inspired by it .
what nathaniel did , so he brought it back to a community of friends .
the power of music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood him , and he realized the communication of information .
and i &apos;m going to keep playing with nathaniel , no matter whether in the walt disney hall , or in the e.u. row , because he reminds me why i became a musician .
thank you .
bruno &apos;s : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something i &apos;m stolen to get the most educated .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so i &apos;ve been surprised in my life many fish .
i just loved two .
this first , that was more like a passionate kind of a traumatic kind .
it was a beautiful fish , and it was good , good consistency , more precise , a book on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was grown in the most highly profitable standards of sustainability .
so you could feel that to sell it .
i had a relationship with this beauty of several months .
one day , the boss of the company asked , and asked if i could put a fan of it on the farm of the farm .
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
so here was a company that was trying to solve what this unimaginable problem was for our chefs , how do we keep fish on our menus ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been blowing the oceans like we beat forests of bare forests .
it &apos;s hard to be the destruction of the destruction .
90 percent of the big fish , which we love , the tuna , the internet , the most cosmopolitan , the water , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , maybe or bad , you know , it &apos;s a part of our future , and it &apos;s a part of our future .
many arguments about it . the environment is the environment , most of them , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a nuclear prize from 15 to one .
this means 15 pounds of water , so you need a pound of a pound .
not very sustainable .
also , not very good .
so finally , there was a company that was trying to do it right .
i wanted to commit them .
on the day before the event , i called the ceo of the pr to the company .
let &apos;s call it don &apos;t call .
don &apos;t say , &quot; i just said , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for that , so far out in the sea , you don &apos;t get rid of the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s &quot; it &apos;s &quot; he said , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out of our fish , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
and the rate of the remote , one , he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
the rate to one , great .
&quot; the rate of what ? what do you feed ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
and at this evening , i was in bed , and i thought , what &apos;s a sustainable protein ?
so , i called the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t go .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he doesn &apos;t know . he will stop .
now , i &apos;m going to do a few people in the company , no one could give me a proper answer to the senior , until finally , with the senior biologist .
let &apos;s call it don &apos;t .
&quot; don &apos;t i , &quot; what are i like to do a sustainable protein ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some of the things , and then he said , &quot; well , he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go . &quot;
i said , &quot; do you know ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , skin , dumpster , trash , dry and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your body &apos;s life is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , these are about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t what &apos;s sustainable about it , chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i &apos;m going to make it from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a computer company and i &apos;m a plastic maker .
that &apos;s me actually .
no , i actually have a plastic designer , because , i swear , i swear to god , who &apos;s beaten fish to this conversation .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love .
it &apos;s romantic kind of , the way you know the better fish , you learn the fish , you love the fish .
i first ate him in a restaurant in a restaurant .
a professional journalist had spoken for a long time of this fish .
it &apos;s kind of a sense of time .
he came up with a bright , almost more , white color .
the chef had him .
wait twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish so well after it was got a fish ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it cisplatin . actually , he &apos;s called the abc .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish and he &apos;s not a chef . at least the way they understand and i &apos;m going to understand .
he &apos;s a biologist in la la la .
this is a very reactive corner of the sun &apos;s surface of spain .
it &apos;s close to the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of the sun .
they were raised in the way that they were basically the wetlands .
they did that by putting the land out of the country .
they built this complicated episode of channels , and they were rejected out of water from the country and beyond the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that that was working , not economically .
and it was a disaster of green .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds to be a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , there was a spanish company bought with green the land .
what did they do ?
they have the flow of water the water .
they literally went to the lever .
instead of using the water , they used the channels to restore water .
they &apos;re making the channels .
they created a 11,000 acres of the street -- the internet , shrimp , shrimp , shrimp -- and the company has the ecological destruction of the world completely completely completely wiped out .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you &apos;re seeing is the water &apos;s channels and these density , lush march .
i was not a long time ago with abc .
he &apos;s a tremendous guy , three parts charles darwin and a part of the crocodile to kiss .
okay ? there we were and fought through the wetlands and i was making a mud and i put mud up to my knees , and i was powerless in quiet to a bribe .
here he is picking up a rare carbon structure .
now he mentioned the most salient of agarikon .
and here , here he is a pattern of focused , which reminds him about the firing giraffe .
it turns out that 190 the biggest part of his career has spent in africa in africa .
i asked him how he became such a comic model .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and falls into more talk of rare birds and algae and weird plastic .
and don &apos;t understand me , that was really fascinating , you know , the community community , the community &apos;s community , in the way that you &apos;re in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was love .
and my head was weak about this kind of piece of delicious fish that i had at the most orphanage .
so i cut him off . i said , &quot; cisplatin , how does it get that your fish tastes so well ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the universality , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do you eat ?
how is the most important thing ? &quot;
now he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a wonderful system that the fish eat , which would eat it in the wild .
the fuel biomass , the tailings biomass , the zoo , that &apos;s what the fish feed .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely valid .
there &apos;s no food .
the one farm is that you don &apos;t hear your animals ?
later , i went on on this site with abc , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems like , &quot; for a place that seems to be like , &quot; how do you have a success ? &quot;
in the moment , when a director would have a director of a rock drum .
and we put on the corner and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pinker , a literally pinker carpet that &apos;s going to be the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your own , pink . &quot;
they &apos;re going to be a little bit more . &quot;
so , i was a very confused .
i said , &quot; cisplatin , you don &apos;t get your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and the birds .
now , last year on this site 600,000 birds were over 250 different ways .
it &apos;s now the biggest and one of the most important private systems in europe .
i said , &quot; cisplatin , is it a good job of the last thing that you want to have on a nuclear pad ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building the food system , not intense .
this is a theme network network .
the pollen industry eats the shrimp .
the shrimp eats the escalators .
so the pinker the belly the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals and a farm that &apos;s going to measure your own lives on your knees .
a more powerful , but also a more powerful .
oh , and by the way , this is not even the case of the first ever .
they breed in a city of 240 miles , where the most sophisticated is better for the most sophisticated .
every morning they fly 240 miles to farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles .
they &apos;re doing that because they can follow the white white line of the highway .
seriously .
i had introduced a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at an airstrip .
i said , &quot; cisplatin , fly around 240 miles to the farm and fly a thousand miles back at the night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me as if i was quoted a song of whitney , i was quoted .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , which was delicious , and i don &apos;t like a little bit of a time . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like them .
it &apos;s this kind of thing , the taste of flavor .
i never cook with it .
and yet , when i tried to try to do it in this restaurant in the south states , she didn &apos;t tasted anything like that .
she liked sweet and in , as if you would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned this to abc and he was making it .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense rate before something in the body .
she &apos;s developed in the course of evolution to breed in the process of descent . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no more education . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed the fish , a farm that measures their success in success .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a farm that has no more , because the water , that flows through this farm from the river , is in the stream .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things to the rivers that are now going to be , to lead them to the chemical pollutants , flow of the water , from the ground .
and when it was fought by the system , and this leaves the water , the water is clean , as it is .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not only one farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals , not just a farm that &apos;s going to measure your own lives on health , but a farm that is literally a single , and not only for those fish , but it &apos;s not just for you
because if the water is blowing up , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because these love love , like romantic , is also writing .
you could say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future of good food , whether we talk about the future or a little bit of the time .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one , in fact , actually , taste good .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit too radical .
we &apos;re not a plastic designer , we &apos;re a lover . we &apos;re lover .
we love farmers . we love small amounts of fish . we &apos;re talking about local food . we &apos;re eating organic .
and if you claim that the things that are going to teach the future is to be good at any point , and says , &quot; hey , hey , i love the most delicious , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we already produce enough calories to feed the world more than only .
one billion people are being starving today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of the most -- because of the most -- of the most prolific inequalities in the distribution , not the greenhouse gas emissions .
now , i don &apos;t like this question because it &apos;s the logic of our favorite , the last 50 years .
feed grain of herbivores , recyclable , of the earth , the same of the earth , chicken on fish , and the whole time has the agribusiness just ask , &quot; if we &apos;re feeding more people , how awful can that be ? &quot;
this was the cause . it was the clear thing . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a recycling in the field of music , a recycling , which allows you to do the very same term of capital , which allows you to do that .
that &apos;s not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our main technology is threatened today , not because of the most powerful , but because of the resources , the resources .
not by the latest , and the most sophisticated , but through fertile land , not through pumps , but through fresh water , not by creationism , but through the forests , and not by the u.s. and the nets , it &apos;s through fish in the ocean .
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that are going to empower each community to feed themselves ?
and to do that , don &apos;t look at the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines , and it has never really been produced for the food .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is what &apos;s going on in two billion years of effort .
look at the weaker farmers like greedy .
businesses that are not worlds for themselves are businesses , they are trying to reproduce rather than the ones that are growing , and they are not just working , they have the ones that are not just being created , but experts , for relationships , not only .
because they are the ones who are experts in taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;m ever going to be .
you know , this is right , because if the future is good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to sort of sort of sort of sort of reflect it , that the whole data that we consume is greater than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking about the other thing that i think they might be thinking about , that patterns are
so what we see here is a typical kind of a typical student .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called the &quot; what i can do with the &quot; s &quot; is that i can filter for a certain cause of death , we say accidents .
and i immediately see another pattern that makes it happen .
and that &apos;s because in the most active part here , people are highly active and over here on the top of the day .
we can move out and go out and see the data and see that the sound and cancer is the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , if we move on and to be a sort of , 40 years , we say , we &apos;re going to see 40 years or younger , we have to think that accidents should be the cause of the people .
and who &apos;s looking at the fact that this is true in men .
so you see that the information is very much remembered by the information and data in this way in a living field .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not do it for content ?
now what we &apos;ve got here is the most individual , every single sport , which has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can like to test it for my talk in your specialty .
with a little bit of a time , you can fly into a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a specific copy .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this copy and the sports .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i click here , and i &apos;m suggesting that all of the time i &apos;ve mentioned to you in these days of lance armstrong .
now , if i want to get a look at a very , i think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the subject of the subject ? &quot;
so i go back to a step and i get the view .
now i see greg chaplin &apos;s .
and so you get an idea that if you hit this kind of information , more specifically , more diverse , zoom , you don &apos;t check , or not just encouraging , or not just encouraging .
you do something that is actually a little different .
it &apos;s something between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to do this idea a little bit more about what a little bit of crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single one of the most sophisticated , and we &apos;ve reduced them to a small summary .
the summary of it has a short view and a symbol of the area that you come from .
i just show the top 500 of the top of the world &apos;s most popular .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
now , we get a sense of the issues that are on wikipedia at the top .
i &apos;m going to choose the &quot; government &quot; .
now , after i &apos;ve chosen government , i know that the most powerful , the most powerful thing that &apos;s going on in the most time is called &quot; people &apos; year . &quot;
this is really important , because this is a realization that is not in a single single state of science .
that &apos;s just to recognize if you go back to a step and look at this .
and so , forgive you a certain of these summaries , i can take a point of time in the subject of the year magazine , and all of them are going to see .
now , if i look at all these people , i realize that the majority of it is the majority of the time . some of them come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss , and one comes from
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize .
so we can jump and look at all the ted prize of winner .
you see , we &apos;re surfing on the web , the first time it &apos;s really a web , not just from side to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
i &apos;m just showing you the new york times website .
so , the use of this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can see websites with the data -- and we bring these pieces of websites to each website like this .
so i can go back to a step , and just jump to a specific unit of unity .
so this is important because you just look at the websites in this kind of web , and in this way , all the way around the same way .
so i can zoom in in my course in a particular time time .
here &apos;s the one that i &apos;ve been on the entire demonstration of this .
and i can kind of do anything i &apos;ve seen today , again .
and , if i go back to a step and look at everything , i can also put my new and more to the new , i think , for the &quot; aw &quot; , i think , for bing , or here , to live for a live period
and here i can go into the side and put them back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used again , and every time it &apos;s doing the big picture , it &apos;s a lot larger than the sum of the world &apos;s population .
now in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the curse of the pack .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going from one to another to the other , we start to go from many things to many things , and that &apos;s what &apos;s otherwise been hidden ?
if we can do this , then this is a tour of the day , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge of it .
and if we know , then we can even pull wisdom from it .
so i &apos;m going to hear , thank you very much .
i grew up with a little science science fiction fiction .
i went to school with the bus , every day , a day , a day .
and my nose always sat in a book , a more threatening , which my thought in other worlds was being corrosive and in a way my mind in my 20s , , excruciating curiosity , was in my own 20s .
this curiosity , also , showed that i was always , when i was not in school , through the forests , and i went to the forests , and they were collecting &quot; samples and snakes and the potato , &quot; and i took everything back to the microscope
i was totally troubled , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and the limits of the possible exploration .
and my love to science fiction seemed to be in my environment , because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and we were exploring the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came in our living room with his fascinating shows that animals and places showed us a miracle of wonder that we never could have imagined before .
so , that &apos;s what i think is very good at the most important time .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there &apos;s neither video games , and there &apos;s no video video that &apos;s going on with a computer label , and i had to put the images in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we had to all the time , when we read a book , we took the description of the author , we took the description of the author and we put them on the screen in our heads .
my reaction to this was drawing and paint from aliens , aliens , robots , robots , and all of the things .
in the math class , i was always caught by the teacher , as i was , hidden in the textbook , hidden .
creativity had to be out of the point .
and what happened was something interesting . because what i was doing was , i was fascinated with jacques atwood , the thought of a really unknown world on our earth .
certainly i would never be a alien world with a spaceship , and that seemed quite unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i actually could walk here on earth , and she was equally fascinating and exotic and exotic as all i &apos;d ever imagined when i read these books .
so i decided to be , when i was 15 , diver .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , one of them was a $ 150,000 mile from the next ocean .
i didn &apos;t let myself cry with that .
i &apos;m going to meet my father until finally , until finally , a new york in buffalo , new york , come on , just on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my favorite in a pool of the middle of the winter in buffalo in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , i got two years to face the face of california , when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about three hours of water , i spent about three hours of water , 500 hours of it in submersibles .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the coastal oceans , is as rich as we can &apos;t really imagine .
the idea of nature doesn &apos;t know any boundaries , in contrast to our own , more important human imagination .
and to the day , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love for the ocean is , with the same intensity , like ever and ever .
when i was a kid , it was a job of the job .
this seemed the best way to get my inner grip , to tell stories , to unite , to unite .
as a child , i always drew comic books and so .
so movies of the way , images and stories , and that fit together .
of course , stories that i &apos;m going to do was , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; the &quot;
in &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; s &quot; i could connect my preference to the world and the shooting .
so , basically , my two passions .
something interesting happened in &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; s problem &quot; to solve a problem in this movie -- and we had to create a kind of liquid , and we refused to do a very strict animation , we found it back .
what came out of this was the first computer-generated computer ever was to see in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t get a money , and he was playing just his energy costs , but i realized something fascinating : the audience on the entire world was like sakena from the magic that ended up .
according to arthur clarke , the law of the law is known to distinguish technology and magic , and magic .
so they saw something magic .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s what &apos;s really going to be in the most sophisticated place . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , much more .
together with a drug set , we created the guy liquid metal , and the success was completely dependent on how this effect would come .
and it worked . again , we had created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same thing , but we have a little bit more money with the film already .
from these two experiences , it was reached a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for the training of creativity .
so i started a company , with my good friend stan winston , who was at the best time of the best , and she was called &quot; digital &quot; digital .
the idea of this company was to skip the phase of analog processes with visual printers , and start to start with digital printers .
and then we did and we managed to get a advantage for a while .
but in the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the middle of the world , and we had a lot of time -- and we had a company that we did , too slow .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar &quot; that should push the slope in the kind of visual effects and the other effects in the new altitudes , with virtually a different human , expressive characters that had been made by the food system , and the world should
but the slope is very nice to stick . and people in my company told me that we weren &apos;t able to be able to do that .
so i shifted this and made this other film about the big ship , the end .
i have sold this as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship , &quot; and it was sold a little piece of the kind of a piece of magnitude , a passionate film .
but i actually wanted to pan up to the real train of the titanic .
so i did this film .
this is the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
but i believe it &apos;s convinced by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to go to the train . we &apos;re going to film the real train .
we &apos;ll show it in the movie of the film .
this is hugely important . it &apos;s a good job of marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but again , that &apos;s back to the fact that your imagination can create reality .
we actually created six months later , in which i fell in a russian hotel in a russian hotel , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i looked at the real titanic through a plastic system .
that was not a movie , no more a fan , which was real .
so , that really blew me up .
and the preparation was enormous . we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things .
and i fell on , as the most amazing , a kind of a piece of time .
well , they were also more adept and more sophisticated planning .
you get up into these capsule , and you go down into this dark , hot environment , where no hope is going to be , if you don &apos;t get back to yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a college shop .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was really obsessed with studying the deep sea .
anyway , by the part of that , and to do science , and it was all . it was all . it was adventure . it was an imagination .
and it was a experience that was not able to give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .
in some of the following expeditions , i saw creatures in the field of affairs , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that had no one ever seen before and for the science at the time , when we saw them , even not
so that &apos;s really true , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met a little unusual decision .
after success , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my back to my ted designer as a filmmaker in hollywood , and i &apos;m going to take a while for a while . &quot;
and then we started to start to explore , we were exploring , and they were exploring with the design of the world .
we went back to the train of the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which was a very high school system .
our intent was , the core of the ship and the inner system of looking at the wheel , which had never been done before .
no one had been exploring the inner state of the world &apos;s inner , and you didn &apos;t have any means of that . so we developed technology .
and so i &apos;m sitting here , on the deck of the titanic , in a plastic scanner , and see planks that are pretty similar to this kind of thing and i know that once the band has played there .
and i fly with a little bit of a little bit of the bow through the ship .
i &apos;m actually breeding it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically in the titanic of the titanic .
this was the most popular form of a design that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i took around a corner , i knew what &apos;s going on in the most appropriate part of the vehicle , because i &apos;ve gone to the film .
so the set of the set was a very precise copy of the ship .
so this was a highly strange experience .
and she made me realize that you &apos;re using this kind of thing that you use , and so you can use your consciousness in the vehicle , and that &apos;s how you feel that in the other form of existence .
it was really profound .
and maybe a little look at what might happen in some decades , if you have a little bit of time to explore or to do something else , or to do something else in all kinds of different forms of information that i can imagine as a computer designer
after that expeditions , we started seeing what we saw down there , really appreciate , for example , these sort of dna systems , where we saw this incredibly amazing animal . that &apos;s kind of alien , but here on earth .
they live with help from a memorable .
they don &apos;t exist in a way of making electricity system , like we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
at the same time , i also became very interested in the most important , which was the most popular from my childhood .
and so i ended up with people who are interested in space and they have to do with nasa and in the world &apos;s business and the right thing , and they go to russia , through the mission , and take the most profound , and take our food
that was fascinating .
but at the end of it , it was that i took a lot of time to put on the deep sea .
i took them to the world and they got access to the world down there : &quot; aw , &quot; people who are interested in extreme situations , and i took them to the sources , and they could test them , and test instruments and testing instruments and testing
we were doing a photographic job , but actually , i was doing science , more specifically , to say , &quot; i was going to say . &quot;
so the circle of my existence was as a as a child , and the way that a child , and the exercise in reality .
and in this process , i learned a lot of learning .
i learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to think a director also has to lead to a leader , a leader like a computer machine or something .
i don &apos;t understand much of leadership before i have these expeditions .
because in a particular point , i had to say , &quot; what do i actually do here ?
why do i do that ? what is it ? &quot;
these stupid films don &apos;t bring us a money .
we &apos;re just playing the cost of the cost , not a way of fame .
all of you think i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and i would have been blowing up the nails on a towel on a cliff .
i &apos;ve all got these movies , these discussions , for a very small audience .
no glory , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it about the task to the challenge -- and the ocean is the most important environment that you have . you &apos;re doing it of the most of the time , and because of the weird connection , that comes out of people .
because we did all this with only 10 to 12 people who have been working on forever , and sometimes we were two to three months on sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is that the basic thing you have is because you &apos;ve overcome a task that you can &apos;t explain any other .
if you go back to land , and you say , &quot; we had to do it , the kind of the teapot , the most complex , and the whole technology , and the difficulty , the human performance , if you work in sea , and that &apos;s
there &apos;s a connection , a mutual respect .
so when i came back to turn my next film , &quot; avatar , &quot; i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you &apos;re going to get your team and get it back in return to respect .
and this was really changed the dynamics .
so , i was going to be with a little team on an unknown terrain , and we did &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that hasn &apos;t been yet .
incredibly exciting .
it &apos;s an enormous challenge .
and we became a very , very successful family for a period of time .
and so , i changed my way to make movies completely .
there were people who were saying we were really doing this kind of thing , and we were going to be transported to the planet .
for me , it was more a kind of a design of mine to do my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we do from all of this ?
what lessons have we learned ?
i think the first thing is , the curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the pleasure of your team is more important than all of the world &apos;s favorite parts of the world .
i come to young filmmakers saying , &quot; give me a advice like i can do something like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t worry yourself .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing for you . do not do it yourself , don &apos;t bet for yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has a secret , &quot; fail is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art and studying , an alternative , because there &apos;s a bit of a time to be there .
no important endeavor , innovation was meant to be the risk of the risk .
you have to be willing to take risks on it .
this is the idea that i like to share with you on the way . failure is not a alternative , but , you know , thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and that might be surprising , because my favorite of the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds to turn things that we invent and deliver to make the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than any other on the planet .
so , the fact that they &apos;re not going to grow the crops over many years , and it &apos;s too much rain , and we &apos;re going to break things out , and things will change how it can &apos;t sustain their fragile environment .
that leads to the power of information . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , a climate change will be terrible for you .
and also , the most important thing for you is very important .
the fact is that if you could only reduce the price of the price , the energy is going to be far beyond the most effective .
now , the most popular is over time .
in fact , the most important thing is the most important thing .
the industrial revolution , the industrial revolution , gave up the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there &apos;s a rapid case in the field of the world , and so we have refrigerators , we can make modern materials , and so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s take the price down -- we &apos;re going to meet a new barrier and these barrier depends on co2 .
co2 is the planet and the equation is actually quite clear .
they add the carbon dioxide , which leads to the most important , and that &apos;s a very negative effect , and effects on the weather and maybe worse , that the indirectly , the natural ecosystems , can &apos;t adapt to the natural ecosystems , and so on .
now , the exact relationship between a plastic and the one of the things that they &apos;re doing is where they &apos;re different , there are some people , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i &apos;ve asked the most powerful , and i have to go down to zero , right ?
not half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature goes further .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a 3.5 feet high truck that has to go under a three feet of bridge , and then you can actually put it underneath .
this is what it has to do , on zero .
now , we &apos;re going to get a lot of a time number every year , over 26 billion tons .
everybody &apos;s about 20 tons of people , people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for every planet .
and somehow we have to create changes that are down to zero .
it &apos;s been up again .
only different economic changes have been influenced at all , and we need to go from the power increase to zero , and to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit -- you have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that &apos;s going to take it away from the number of people , and that will depend on the number of
so let &apos;s look at each one of the other , and we think , how do we get that on zero .
probably one of these numbers has to come close to zero .
now this is a basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first of all , we have the population .
today , 190 billion people live .
and it turns out to be nine billion of the road that are going on on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines that are the most powerful and more cosmopolitan , we might probably be able to reduce 10 percent to 15 percent , but we &apos;re seeing a slope to see 1.3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
that includes all the food that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
these are very good things , and they &apos;re very good at making these services almost every one on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we may probably be able to make some pcbs and use less , but average is going to increase every year and then all the time , and all of the time , the number of services that are going
here we see a very basic service . there &apos;s home , so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their favorite level of the water .
now , at efficiency , e , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that &apos;s not rising .
because of different successes in the most powerful , by other ways , through new methods , there are many services , there are many services that are going to give the energy to a number of individual services .
in other ways , how to create the manufacturing of the world &apos;s energy , 105 31 : in 1979 : the -- and , in the 1930s , it &apos;s a lot of a little bit smaller , about nine : in 1985 , the way that it &apos;s
all of a sudden , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may be able to reduce a factor three or maybe even a factor six or maybe a factor six .
but at the first three factors , we &apos;re now from 26 billion to maybe the hardest 13 billion tons of tons , and that &apos;s not enough !
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to be formed per unit of energy .
it turns out that if you can get it on zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
almost every single time for electricity today , carbon dioxide , except renewables and delivery of energy .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need the data .
now , if i use the term &quot; wonder , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and the service is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these miracles .
there &apos;s no deadline , usually , that you need a miracle to a certain date .
normally , you &apos;re just going to be wrong and some people come , not .
but in this case , we have to give up a miracle and a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered how can i get this to get this ?
is there natural projections , a demonstration that &apos;s going to be presented to the idea of people here ?
i remembered last year when i brought mosquitos and somehow liked the people .
the idea was really , really , really tangible , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
and for energy , i fell here .
i decided that the way to get rid of fireflies is to be my own contribution to the environment here .
so here &apos;s a couple of natural fireflies .
you &apos;ve told me that you don &apos;t bite . you &apos;re not going to even leave the glass .
now , there are all kinds of things like this , but they don &apos;t bring much .
we need solutions , either one or several times , or a greater scale of government , and even though there are many directions , where people are looking for them , i really see five , which can do these big demands .
i &apos;ve left tides , and i have the tides , fusion and biofuels .
this may be a decent contribution , and if you &apos;re making better than i expect , it would be great , but my punch line here is that we have to work on all these five , and we can &apos;t give them a lot of time because they
let &apos;s first take the burning fossil fuels , burning from either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do is just seem to be , but that &apos;s not it . you have to have all the co2 that goes from the burning of the intangible , and then you get out of pressure and then you hope that there &apos;s remains there .
there are some of the main things that are going on on a 60 percent -- 80 percent of the level , but it &apos;s going to be a 100 percent of the time , and one of the things that makes it a match is a lot of the
who will make it make sure ?
who can possibly guarantee what a lot of the amount of waste is larger than any kind of waste , which you can imagine from the surface of the other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a hard problem .
next , it &apos;s a second .
the other thing that has three big problems , the cost , especially in the world &apos;s countries are high , and the question for security is that you can really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human involvement , that the fuel is not used for
and what do you do with the waste ?
because although it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work .
the last three of the five i put in .
it &apos;s the renewables that are often called the renewables .
and also , even though it &apos;s great , they don &apos;t need fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
one is the energy energy that creates these technologies dramatically than the power of power .
these are the kinds of things that are , you know , a lot of the surface of the world , a hundred times more surface than a normal power station .
and that sources of the sources of uninterrupted .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem to be all the day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be the wind and the wind doesn &apos;t always blow the wind .
so you have to , if you depend on these sources , you have a way to have energy in times when you &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s a big amount of time here . there are challenges in transmission . if we say that the energy source is outside the country , they don &apos;t just need the technology , they have to deal with the risk that energy from where different from each
and there &apos;s the most important thing .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve all got the kinds of batteries that are made , looking at the cars , computers , mobile phones , mobile phones , for everything , and i found that all the batteries that we &apos;re producing now is a lot of
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that will be a factor 100 better than the approaches of the time .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
this is what happens when you try to say this kind of thing that we &apos;re going to say about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest of the rest .
if you want to get 100 percent on this , you need an incredible amount of energy .
now , where should we go : what is the right approach ?
&quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the goal ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds of them .
in each one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
in many ways , they &apos;re going to say , these are crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there are a lot of people in the ted group that already are engaged in there .
bill big companies , among other companies , have a so-called the great one of the great people .
and the other thing that i &apos;m making is a lot of the design of the great things that are very great things to do , and i &apos;m trying to support interesting possibilities and i try to support it .
nathan myhrvold and i finance a company that , maybe , is the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the most sophisticated ; it &apos;s called liquid , liquid .
the development of this industry has stopped in this industry , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts around the board .
the most important thing is that instead of a part of the climate change , you &apos;re going to get a percent that &apos;s the one percent , we decided to burn the 99 percent that &apos;s the most important thing .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it , but you could never simulate a reasonable balance , but since it &apos;s been there , there &apos;s a modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and you can see that it &apos;s acting .
and because you &apos;re burning this 99 percent , the average is very much better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can even use the waste of the waste of reactors as a car .
instead of breaking it down , they just burn it . a great thing .
so the uranium is incremental , a little bit like a candle .
you see , it &apos;s a kind of pillar , often as a &quot; traveling wave reactor . &quot;
that &apos;s really the key thing .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste that the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called the &quot; print uranium . &quot;
the skin the u.s. &apos;s skin for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re inexpensive and just just , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges there , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think of how we should measure our success .
how should our testimony look ?
now , let &apos;s go to the destination that we have to reach and then talk about the most important .
many talk about one 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of the 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something agriculture , and hopefully , it &apos;s going to be a little bit more interactive and cement to then clean .
so to get these 80 percent , the developed developed developed countries , including countries like china , completely changing their own .
the other grade says whether we use the most sophisticated technology , whether they &apos;ve been used in all developed countries and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great important .
this is going to be a key of this .
if we go back from there , how should it be looking at 2020 ?
it should be the two elements of the two .
we should use the use of the energy , to bring reduce electricity emissions , the less we &apos;re going to be more , the lower , the more the growth , and also the temperature .
but actually , this note is the actual thing that we &apos;re doing , which is not completely important to the big school of the big world , just right , or even something less important than the other that &apos;s the speed of innovation .
we have to use this breakthroughs with the test of the world , and we can measure that , in the middle of the city , in the north states and the water .
there are many great books to this topic .
the al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david &apos;s energy , &quot; and david &apos;s energy . &quot;
they &apos;re really going to go through and create a frame where this can be discussed , because we need to support all the pages .
there &apos;s a lot of things that have to come together .
this is a wish .
a very concrete wish , that we invent this technology .
if you just gave me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love , or i could choose this wish , which is , i could take this desire , the desire to take the desire to take
this has the largest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this desire , the digging out of the world &apos;s time is going to be terrible and more short of people , between the united states and china , between poor and rich , and almost all of these two billion will be very much
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do ?
we need to use more research research .
if countries are in places like the street , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should talk to these kinds of things and they were shocked by the ridiculous few things that are going on for these innovative approaches .
we need the carbon control , co2 taxes , of the workers , and the business of &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; trade &amp; amp ; trade &amp;
we need to spread the message .
we have to have dialogue and full of things , and also things that are going to be done by government .
it &apos;s a very important wish , but i think we can fulfill it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- first , can you give us an idea of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to do the simulation on a supercomputer , all the large scientists , what we &apos;ve done , we need only some 10 million , and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure it &apos;s just a little bit more comfortable
the difficult step is building the first water , and finding more billions of times that the world &apos;s first one builds up .
once the first finished , when it &apos;s going to be like this , it &apos;s all clear , because the economic economy is so different , the energy density is so different than you know .
to understand that right , that means building deep in the ground almost like a vertical column nuclear energy , that uses the energy and then works on the top , and then works on the top ?
so , the question is , right . now , you have to rethink the reactor &apos;s reactor , so there &apos;s many people and many control that can go wrong . this thing where you open it and puts things back , or it &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can get it into 60 years -- think of a column -- you &apos;re going to be buried without all the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there , and it &apos;s done for 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
a computer company , which is giving you a solution to the garbage .
so , you know , yes , yeah . now , what happens to the garbage : you can sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less trash with this method -- then you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it on the next reactor
and we start by taking the garbage that &apos;s already there , which is in these areas of the or the metal stations in these lines , and this is our main model .
so , what &apos;s a problem for these reactors is what we put in our fill and it &apos;s going to reduce the most dramatic component during this process .
but as you talk to different people in the world about these possibilities .
where is the biggest interest , what really do ?
so , we &apos;re not going to put it on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting things that we have in the name of the &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name of the &quot; nuclear &quot; in russia , and there are a lot of interest
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something that &apos;s going on in the direction .
this is a version of one thing that was made .
this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a little reactor and some countries built this , so everyone is a quick reactor , a very rapid reactor for our first .
in your mind , you know , a little bit of time and probability and chance to make a difference in your life ?
so , we need to say , well , we need one of these most amazing , more powerful things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then take 20 years .
this is basically the deadline that has shown us the most powerful , which we need to get away .
and , you know , you know , the way it &apos;s going to do all the good , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could hold it easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of things that are just as if their approaches work , the development of their pilots work for their pilots , to work on it .
and it would be best if it could do multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
and anyway , we need a solution .
the big way of the great breakthroughs is this the largest one you know ?
so , the most important thing is , a real important thing .
it would have been without the most important , but it &apos;s the power of it .
in nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know how to do this as well as these , but there &apos;s the modular method that is a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid carbon system that seems to be a little difficult , but maybe the one that is going to say that about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the beauty of it is that a million times a million times more energy , say , we say , a more powerful and therefore , if you can handle the problems and the cost , the potential , the impact on the
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we have to put the data to try to try and try to make the most stable ?
so , if you come to this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;ve got too much , and you &apos;re a little bit of a heart attack , and what you do is you might have a heart attack , or you might have a surgery or something
there &apos;s a research survey called the most important thing that is about taking a different use of the warming to keep warming , so that we &apos;ve gotten 20 or 30 years longer to get us out of it .
this is just a single one .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t be working on insurance because maybe it makes a lazy force so you eat , because you know that one is going to save the heart attack .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s smart if you get the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in the field of information that you should have done , if things should come faster , if things are going faster , or that innovation needs longer
climate change : do you have a or two sentences for that , to convince you ?
so , the u.s. s : well , unfortunately , the skeptic in very different camps .
the ones that make scientific arguments are very little .
do you say there &apos;s negative effects that have to do with the clouds that are moving things ?
there are very , very few things that you can tell at all , which is a chance in a million .
so the problem here is so similar to aids .
you &apos;re doing the mistake now , and you pay for a lot later .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of different problems in something that you have only later -- and that is that the investment is not so clear , and that &apos;s not necessarily the the ipcc report , and there are people in
the fact is that this uncertainty should be worried about us .
but my dream here is that if you can do it , and the co2 is going to be thrown up , then the skeptics says , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not a really , i &apos;m not sure it &apos;s not co2 , i wish it &apos;s cheaper
and that would be your answer to the most important argument that if you use all of these time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals that are going to keep the most effective , the most powerful , that is to keep the money
so , the question is , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. age of 10 billion a year than they do today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
there &apos;s no other stuff underneath that .
you come to big life skills , and here you can disagree with reasonable people if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and trying to fund that , and i &apos;m going to try to fund most of the waste .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re very short of a day of a day and funded the learning curve , i think we should try more things that have the potential to be much cheaper .
if the cloudy line you get , you can get a very high high school , and then you can keep the rich .
i mean , each of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even more , you know , think about it .
his new york is now , &quot; why don &apos;t research be spoken anymore ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to be because of his former stories , associated with the most prolific , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and therefore he &apos;s going to get the most lonely .
and that &apos;s a struggle i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little the support is going to be .
bill , i think , i &apos;m talking about almost all people here , if i say , i really hope you will be true . many , thank you very much .
rs : thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , peter fermi , a computer named the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
the idea is quite easy . the biggest thing is , the biggest one is the biggest of the structure with 20 spaghetti tape , about a meter of light , and building a marshmallow .
the marshmallow has to be up on top .
and , although it really seems to be really hard , it &apos;s really hard to work because it &apos;s doing very quickly .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a plastic scanner .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world with students , developers and architects , even with the most cosmopolitan and there is something about the task , which allows deep sensations in nature and i want to share some of them .
usually most people start to engage themselves in the task .
they talk about it , they think about how it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to make it .
then you invest a little bit of time , and you &apos;re betting , you &apos;re betting and put spaghetti .
they &apos;re investing in the most often more of their time in the world &apos;s business .
and finally , shortly before you don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow and you put it carefully on the top , and you get a step back and forth , and you admire your work .
but what happens then , almost always happens , is that the &quot; s &quot; becomes a &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the marshmallow &quot; is that the whole thing is going to bend and the whole thing .
there &apos;s a series of people who have a lot more , &quot; born &quot; treatment than others , and under the worst are fresh , fresh water companies .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and they really make a lot of things .
and of course , there are teams that have a lot more &quot; the &quot; extra &quot; of the world &apos;s &quot; s &quot; and the best children &apos; students &apos; fingertips .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as we did peter , they didn &apos;t just make the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is : how does this happen ? why ? what about those ?
and peter says , &quot; no one of the kids invested at being at the head of spaghetti art . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest at the time in the field of research .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that &apos;s that the training workers were trained to find a proper plan , ok !
and then it seems to me .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s different about what &apos;s different is that they start to start with the marshmallow and building prototypes , successful prototypes , with the marshmallow at the top , so they have a chance to fix the possibility of fixing prototypes .
and the way that they see this kind of collaboration as a core of a brain &apos;s cube .
and with every attempt , the kids get immediate feedback , which is what works and what they don &apos;t .
so , the performance of working with prototypes , much of a lot , but let &apos;s see how different teams are acting .
average for most of the time is about the most important , and the average , the one half of them , lawyers , is more , but not much , they &apos;re better than the adults .
who is most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
the highest one i &apos;ve seen is the highest thing .
and why ? because they &apos;re understanding the integration and they &apos;re the geometric geometric patterns to build robust structures .
ceos are about average . but here &apos;s what &apos;s interesting .
you get an underdog on the team , you &apos;re going to be significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see , you see , and you see this team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why is this ?
because they have special skills of the internet .
they run the process , they understand it .
and this team , the further to get out and look at the work of the team significantly better than the performance of the team .
specialized skills and the combination of success and the combination of success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical thing you have , you get about six , which have robust structures .
i was trying to do something interesting now .
i thought we could get the same thing .
so i offered a $ 10,000 price of software for the winner .
what happened to these kinds of things ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if somebody was building a high construction system , he would have carried the price home .
so , isn &apos;t it interesting that high school costs have a strong effect ?
we repeated these practices with the same students .
what happened now ?
now she understood the advantage of the prototyping .
so , it became the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the same time .
so there &apos;s a lot of lessons for us , and we &apos;re going to be a lot of the human phone , and success .
you might ask : why would someone actually invest time to create a more powerful ?
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and &quot; visual &quot; and &quot; visual &quot; .
and what the most important thing is , they actually make them hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge provides a common experience , a common language , or a common language , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in the eyes can go to the car .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how you build the marshmallow .
there &apos;s a video of the room there .
they find crazy examples of all the world , like people optimize the system and make it more stable .
there &apos;s also a lot of time .
and the lesson of the lesson i think is actually a secret sport .
it requires that we all make our senses on the task and we think we &apos;re using our thinking of how our feelings and our actions are in the challenge that we are .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is all about what it takes to bring us from a &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so let &apos;s do this as if we have a machine .
a big machine , a cool , more complex machine , and this is a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to be inside .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i wonder what they would choose because i asked my friends recently , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to time before there was cars or twitter or america , &quot; america . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i believe that you &apos;re kind of drawn to nostalgia , to be drawn to the mercy .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of that group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a explorers .
it &apos;s because possibilities are not going back to this planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that ever had on this planet , no matter what scale they do : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining , declining .
there was never time to have a time .
my favorite child died all of them as they were 60 .
my grandparents argued this number on 70 .
my parents are the 80 on the top of the road .
so there should be a nine year-old at the beginning of my favorite day .
but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who &apos;s born today can expect to live in new delhi , as long as the richest man on the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is this ?
smallpox . smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;ve been shaped in a way that the demographics of the earth are actually shaped in a way that has no war .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we &apos;ve been attached to them .
in the rich world , diseases that have been in the wild , the millions of us only have a generation of even one generation .
so , the patent , the polio , polio , polio ...
anybody even know what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are the successes of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try and look at things , look , whether it works , if it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the great achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , the whole good news is , because there &apos;s a few other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned .
and one of them is that despite all our achievements , we &apos;re going to go hungry every day to bed every day .
this number goes up , and it goes very quickly , and that &apos;s a shame .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to trash the world .
drinking water , land , oil , gas , gas : they disappear , and if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , and we &apos;re not going to go away from this chaos .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food , the billions of people will feed , without the country that they live on .
i think we can supply this world with energy that they don &apos;t yet kill .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a fair job .
but this is a reminder of me at night -- one of the things that awake me at night , we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress so much , as well , never , never , never , never , never , never .
and we &apos;ve never been able to make it reasonable , as we can now .
we &apos;re at the threshold of amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think that we have to go back hundreds of thousands , 300 years before the enlightenment to find a time where we have a lot of progress in progress , in which we have
people are going to focus in their faith , and that &apos;s so close to you that you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth is going to release it .
and listen , everybody has a right to think about it ; even a very good thing to do is to work on progress .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
they don &apos;t have a right to their own facts . &quot; sorry , they don &apos;t have .
and i took a while to figure out .
about a decade ago , i wrote a paper about the new york , a little article .
and i was amazed to resistance on resistance , on resistance , which is the most effective activity in the history of mankind .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote a paper and drove .
and soon , i wrote a paper about engineered food .
the same thing , just bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i wrote a paper about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; , why they believed that molecules were a random kind of a random kind of moving around the area of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept doing it .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re going to be rich , we &apos;re going to eat that , that &apos;s okay .
but this article was worried about me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it .
and that &apos;s because these builders were doing me all the time at all .
these were people who were educated people , people , decent people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that was what i did .
but then i thought , you know what , are we honest ?
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as we used to .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking to ironic , with little quotes , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , so there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what &apos;s the reasons .
we have trust in institutions in the consumer , authority , and sometimes in science , and there &apos;s no reason why that shouldn &apos;t be .
you can just call some names and people will understand .
chernobyl , the challenger , the aurochs , the challenger , the mass of mass cancer , the u.s.
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people that we believed that they were always right . so , they were skeptical .
ask questions , ask the evidence , ask evidence .
don &apos;t take any of them to go .
but now , when you get to the evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can say that from the reason that we &apos;re now living in an epidemic of fear , as i never saw it , and hopefully never see .
about 12 years ago , a story published a story , a terrible story that the mother &apos;s arm , and the cat vaccine , brought up and brought the vaccine into connection .
very scary .
and there were a lot of studies done to see if that was true .
there are a lot of studies that are done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came out in the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make a difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see to see what we think we &apos;re really doing .
we don &apos;t believe in a pile of documents of a plastic that gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do .
but do you know what ?
the result of that was catastrophic .
catastrophic relief because of this fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world where immunization for malnutrition are falling down for malnutrition .
this is a little bit of a time and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happened is we could do that .
well , i understand this .
because anybody here has a biopsy ?
has one of the people who have ever been dying in malnutrition ?
it &apos;s not very often happening .
in this country , it &apos;s not happening at all , but we &apos;re in the world last year .
this is a lot of deaths by exports , 20 per hour .
but because this is not happening here , we can do it , and people like jenny in the way to walk around and to be afraid of fear and illiteracy and illiteracy &apos;s name of platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and you can do that because you don &apos;t connect the cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never , they &apos;re the same .
and that &apos;s something that we need to learn , and that &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas pei .
he was at the worst of the most difficult art of humanity .
no fear , no harm , polio , pop , disappeared .
the guy in the middle doesn &apos;t get so much .
he &apos;s called paul atwood .
he &apos;s just developed a few other people who have a little bit of a time .
he can save the lives of the world &apos;s lives , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul &apos;s style and vaccines talk about , and they say , how valuable they are , and that people should just stop to shave .
and he actually says that .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul speaks to a public , he can &apos;t tell you without armed guards .
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where their children go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say that , but vaccines are essential .
you take them on , return the diseases , and the particles , and it &apos;s happening right now .
we have now juarez , in this country .
and that &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids die again , because this is just one question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die on malnutrition .
what about polio ? do we do that . why not ?
a couple of weeks ago , i wrote a couple of weeks ago , and she thinks i &apos;m a little too sharp .
nobody ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against polio . no way .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
we had no polio in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe you &apos;d get somebody in lagos , and you &apos;re flying in a plane , and you &apos;re flying back to los angeles right now .
and in a few hours , he lands and a car , and he &apos;s going to go for long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these most delicious , and he &apos;s going to visit this one .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a continual disease , and we don &apos;t know , because it &apos;s working on the world now .
this is the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do that as if it &apos;s not .
we love to regenerate ourselves . we love to regenerate .
did you all have their vitamins tomorrow ?
and you know , a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a sudden that helps you to stick on the tracks .
i know they &apos;ve done that because half the americans do it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make a difference , as often we find out that they &apos;re useless .
the data is constantly showing .
they &apos;re cutting their urine . they &apos;re almost never doing .
this is okay , you like to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i &apos;m going to give you a big voice .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and that &apos;s not what we should do . our healthcare system is 450 .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing , and it &apos;s really amazing to ourselves that can afford to do it .
so we &apos;re going away from the way , and where do we walk ?
we &apos;re running into the poor of the world &apos;s arms .
this is great . i love the most delicious .
but you know , this is really a serious issue , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars .
and i &apos;ve all got a little bit of confusion here .
none of them -- -- the -- i was , &quot; -- &quot; i was , &quot; i was not sure what that was , but i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars for it .
and you know what ? if i say that , people say , &quot; what cares ? let &apos;s do it ? let people do what they want .
so you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they have wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the health care that says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to be the evidence of the experts to mammography , &quot; or any kind of a little bit of a time that &apos;s going to treat his patients with a
if you &apos;re going to get on this way where faith and magic changes and science replace science , you get a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to the water of the south africa in south africa .
he brought 400,000 of his people to say that red , he was a lot more effective , and the red , and more effective , more effective than antiretroviral drugs that we know that they could be able to do the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of homosexual deaths in a country that will be worse than any other of this disease .
please don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
they have them . they always have them .
now the most important epidemic that we &apos;re right now is this kind of continuity of the world &apos;s favorite struggle , and the most amazing struggle .
this is a discussion of a debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphor .
that &apos;s ideology , not science .
everything we eat every single one , every branch , all the branch , each of the respiratory generators , has changed by the people .
you know , there was no standard in paradise .
there was no standard .
there was no standard . we did it all .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them have worked and some of them don &apos;t .
we &apos;re getting rid of what &apos;s not working .
now we can do it more closely , and of course , there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , their lives .
do you want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re continually adapted to our own food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m doing is , too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , hormones , we don &apos;t want a huge area with one thing that is wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to have seeds .
and you know what my answer is to all of this ?
yeah , they &apos;re right . we fix that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge amount of energy , but that &apos;s not science .
that has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , more delicious .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes he &apos;s working and sometimes not , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we fear the world &apos;s really senior , and it holds millions of people from an extension .
you know , in the next 50 years , we will have to grow 70 percent more food than right now . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
joe . ben .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? they create food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this kind of thing , like , to be displaced .
it &apos;s been done , a little half of a billion people .
it &apos;s like a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s 450 .
it doesn &apos;t have nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are building all this in it .
and then people could eat the food and not be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be janine oscar , but it would be nice .
and all i can say to this is : why do we fight this ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to move genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our cheating on bigger food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice &apos;s plastic , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re doing so on , we &apos;re going to be guilty of something that we don &apos;t want to be guilty of , i think , not guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s our not worthy , and we need to really stop this .
so , after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; do you still want to go into this ridiculous machine and go into the future ? &quot;
anyway . i want to go on every case .
now , in the present , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put these days on everything we want .
we can move them out where we want them to move , and we will move them there , where we want .
we have to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but when we go into the time time , we &apos;re going to be happy to have that .
i know that we can , and it &apos;s a little bit of what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
since some time i &apos;m interested in the ted system , it may seem strange that a magician is interested in it , because they look like i think , &quot; a deception , which is going to be real , if someone is just going to be aware of
in other words , sugar has shown a measurable effect in some studies , which is just because the person thinks what happens to her is a more powerful or a kind of ... in the most , a sense of the patient that &apos;s called the patient &apos;s own
a deception becomes something real , because somebody is so aware of it .
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that has at least since the 1950s in every single country .
i even learned it from the most amazing magic of magic in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i &apos;ll explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife that you can study ; my hand , you can study them .
i &apos;m just going to hold the knife in my closet .
i &apos;m going to push my sleeve back .
and to make sure nothing in my sleeve is leaving or out of him , i &apos;m just going to put my wrist right here .
you can see that there &apos;s no time to move anything . as long as i &apos;m here , there &apos;s nothing in my sleeve , or come out .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife will be held through my naked infinite magnetism .
it actually stays in his place that i can shake it , without that knife .
nothing goes into my sleeve or come out , no more , no more , you can study it . and you can study everything .
so , you know !
now , this is a trick i often have little kids , which are really interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you here in the room know this trick .
he works like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to make my wrist out to make sure nothing in my sleeve disappears or coming out of it , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i put my wrist back is that it &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
and in the moment , where i &apos;m going to get my hand from you to see them from back , this finger is moving here , my theremin , just from there , where he was so extended .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody who &apos;s not in the back of the day .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i &apos;m a little bit of time , the fingers change his position .
and now you can talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there &apos;s only three fingers down here , because the mind and the way it &apos;s wired information , it doesn &apos;t count one , two , three , but you &apos;re
but this is actually not what &apos;s going on here , and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s going to be held there , but not by magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my porsche , that &apos;s there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing happens by letting me go through this movement , that the finger is moving back again .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can show you your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does that have to do with the design system ?
a year or so , i read a study that really blew me up .
i &apos;m not a doctor , or i &apos;m a researcher , and that &apos;s why it was an amazing thing for me .
and it turns out that if you offer a placebo placebo in a white pill , the form of a football ball , it &apos;s just a round of a sudden , white pill that has a certain effect .
but if you give the shape that you give down the placebo placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and this blue color is actually a little bit of a , and it &apos;s actually a letter on it , it &apos;s actually measurable .
and that , although none of these are a little bit of a little bit of the time -- it &apos;s just sugar .
but a white pill is not as good as a millimeter .
what ? that &apos;s really what i really damn damn crazy .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
if you take marijuana , the other species are more effective than every form .
a colored capsule , which is at a end yellow and on the other red , is better than a white capsule .
also the fluctuations play a role .
a pill twice is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the very same statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is , ...
... that also the doses of a matter .
and the shape is playing a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate design system , you have to grab your needle .
right ? a syringe with a cat &apos;s -- a few of the things that you &apos;re being punished with is a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in your head . this is a lot stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you a different time , if we have a satellite table .
so , the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work so well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and none of them really have a really real property of the property , it &apos;s only our belief that we can achieve in a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i take something that is obvious , and i &apos;m going to take it really .
we know from this study that you have to reach up to the needle if it &apos;s going to go to the thing .
this is a six inches long ago . it &apos;s very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very disappointing , and i &apos;m going to leave you with a little bit of sterile .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not a special cultural meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin and run through them through the other side , and then it &apos;s taken back to the other side .
if you &apos;re bad , if you fall down , i &apos;ve taken a couple of friends at the room , and i showed some friends that i don &apos;t know , and a woman that i didn &apos;t know , and it &apos;s almost almost powerless .
so i propose , if you &apos;re quick , you &apos;re looking for the next 30 seconds , or , you know , i &apos;m going to make the first sensitive part of this , and you &apos;re going to make the first sensitive part here .
you can see it right now , but you can also also see it , if you want .
so , it &apos;s like that , right here , where my flesh starts , at the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little gombe .
i &apos;m really sorry . does it make you crazy ?
and now just a little bit of my skin and on the other side , it &apos;s like that .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the same situation .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see this .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so dumb and more naughty , and the skin just to talk to us for a few minutes . &quot;
now , i &apos;ll show you it .
how does this look like this ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people back to the back say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen this right . &quot;
people in the world &apos;s office come in .
let me show you from that near .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
this is my flesh , and i can cut it up .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re bad , you &apos;re looking at it .
the back of the people , the back , the one that would see that later on video , will say , &quot; well , it looks pretty impressive , but if it was real , he would be a hole , and there &apos;s a hole , and there
okay , let me just take a little blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
now , i would take the needle to take .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this frame here , and with the purpose of a deception , i &apos;m going to just make the needle just there , and so on the stage .
we &apos;ll see a couple of times in the next days .
i hope you &apos;re looking at it . thank you very much .
everybody speaks about happiness today .
i have some people who are counting the number of books that were published with happiness in the title of the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and there was much more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of the time .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all these tide of work , there are several cognitive cognitive gains that are kind of impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly going to act from these cognitive heights .
that &apos;s true for terms of terms of their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out we &apos;re just as mess as any other .
the first one of these falls is a very , complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a word , because we apply it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could just throw it out , but in the big and large , that &apos;s something we need to give to , and we &apos;ll need to take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is an honor of experience and memory : basically it &apos;s between happy in his life and happy , and happy with his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both the most important in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the most horrifying , and that &apos;s the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a situation that affects well-being without its significance .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now i &apos;d like to start with one example of someone who had a family company after one of my lectures , who was telling a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he had heard a symphony , and it was absolutely beautiful music , and it was absolutely
and then he added , really emotional , which has been ruined all the experience .
but that didn &apos;t .
what it had been ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of music .
they weren &apos;t concerned because he was a memory of memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he had to keep him .
what we really say is that we could think about ourselves and thinking about other people in the sense of the self .
there &apos;s a video of self that lives in the present and the present , is able to experience the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the most important self that the doctor is going to be -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; do you hurt if i &apos;m going to get you here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a more painful self , and the most important self is that the most important and the story of our lives is going to be upright , and it &apos;s the one that is telling the doctor , &quot; how have you felt in the last
or &quot; how did their journey after albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the most important self , and the most important self , and the two to confuse is part of the most of the most popular of the happiness .
now , the most important self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories if we do it to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories that means what we can keep from our experience is a story .
and let &apos;s start with a example of a little bit .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who are doing a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details . she &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds of their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who has a more likely deal ? &quot;
and this is a very simple question .
patient b has been suffering more than that , and his favorite time was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient a patient had a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient was a much worse to the patient &apos;s population , as a patient b.
the stories of the world &apos;s population were different , and because a very important part of the story is how they end .
and none of these stories is very , very strong or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is clear than the other .
and the worse is the one that was the pain at the end of his peak , and it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people to be asked , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing all in common ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than for b in the u.s. war .
now , this is a direct conflict between the most important self and the most populous self .
from the point of view of the design self , b has clearly a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , you could actually get the patient &apos;s license from a patient to just shake the tube without too much .
that &apos;s going to lead the patient , but only a little bit less than before .
and if you do a few minutes , you make that the most important self itself is a bad turn , and you have that , you know , the most powerful self is a much better thing , because you &apos;ve given the patient a much better story about
what &apos;s a story ?
and that &apos;s true for stories that are memory , and it &apos;s also true for stories that we invent .
and what a story is of course is that the difference of a story , significant moments and ends .
end is very , very important and in this case , that is dominated by the end .
now , the most important self lives in life constantly .
it has moments of the design , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really easy . they &apos;re always lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i think that -- you know , the psychological present as about three seconds . what means you know that there are about 600 million of them , and most of them don &apos;t leave a trace . most of
most of you will completely ignore the most of you .
and yet , you can somehow get the impression that you should count that what happens during these moments of the world &apos;s life .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use while we &apos;re on this world .
and how we would use it to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the most important self for us .
so we have the most important self , and the most important self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is to be with time .
from the point of view , if you have a vacation , and the second week is so good as the first one , then the most powerful vacation is twice as good as the most sophisticated vacation .
that &apos;s not how it works at all itself .
for the most important self , a vacation vacation is barely better than the most important vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories .
they don &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable that is different from a more of itself , and time has very little influence on this story .
now , the most important self makes more than remember and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually , actually , the decisions that make decisions , because if you have a patient who , we had two different surgeons , and decide what he should choose to choose , then the one who &apos;s going to be selected , is the one who will
the most important thing is that the math of this is not a voice in this election .
actually , we don &apos;t choose between experiences . we choose to do the experiences of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as a concept .
we think about our future as a human health .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the brain &apos;s energy , and you can think of the most important self as one , which is the kind of the most important self to do through experience that the most sophisticated
i have the impression that if we do a holiday , that &apos;s the case that we &apos;re doing on vacation , and we &apos;re doing on the service of the most of the brain &apos;s services .
and that &apos;s a little bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much of our memories of our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s given for the dominance of the design self .
and if i think about it , i think of a vacation that we did in antarctica a few years ago , which was clearly the best holiday i had ever had , and i think relatively often in relation to how often i think of other people .
and i probably have a lot of my memories on these kinds of trips , and i would say about 25 minutes for the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the folder with 600 images in it , i spent another hour .
now , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s just a half hours .
there seems to be a systematic problem .
now , i like a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the top of your memories , but even if you &apos;re doing more of it , you &apos;re a real question . why give your memories so much weight to the weight that
so i want you to think about a thought of a thought .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the ted system , all your images are being wiped out , and you get a drug sample , so you &apos;ll remember nothing .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you choose a different vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species of self and you have to think about how they decide that conflict and that &apos;s really not obvious because if you think of your memories of your time , you can get a
why we choose the most important thing that we choose is a problem that is a choice between the two species of self .
now , the two types of self will throw two words from happiness .
there are actually two concepts from happiness that we can apply to one self .
so you can ask : how happy is this the most important self ?
and then you would ask , how happy are these moments of life in the life of the world ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
which are the emotions that are measured ?
and by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of happiness from the happiness self .
if you &apos;re lucky to ask the happiness of the world &apos;s own , it &apos;s a very different thing .
this is not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s how happy or delighted is , if this person is thinking about her life .
very different term .
everybody who &apos;s not different is going to be different to the study of happiness , and i &apos;m one of the researchers about well-being that have been doing the research of happiness for long , which is the kind of kind of thing that they &apos;ve been enjoying for
the distinction between happiness itself and the happiness of the world &apos;s hands has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re going to be able to measure the two interventions .
the gallup organization has a global survey , where more than half a million people have been asked about , what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started learning about the happiness of the two species .
and the main lesson we think i learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how someone &apos;s happy with his life , and it really doesn &apos;t teach them a lot of how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you an idea of correlation that is related to the heart of it .
what that means is that if you meet someone and you would tell you , oh , his father is a little bit of a time , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody has his life as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his own life .
so correlation is low .
we know something about what happiness is determined with .
we know that money is very important , and we &apos;re very important .
we know that happiness means being satisfied with people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the lucky species of the self , you &apos;re going to do very different things in the end .
the conclusion of what i &apos;ve said here is that we really shouldn &apos;t imagine ourselves as a replacement substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very quickly , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are going to be the right answer .
if you think about this question , people have to be happier in california if they say , in ohio , we &apos;re living in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think of the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate isn &apos;t very important for the most important self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the appropriate self to decide how happy people are .
but , because the appropriate self is responsible , you can at the end -- some people could go to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track what happens to people who go to california , happier .
now , your favorite self is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because if you &apos;re going to think about it , you &apos;ll be reminded how awful the weather in ohio was in ohio , and you &apos;ll feel that you &apos;ve hit the right decision
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve got a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question to you .
thank you .
now , when we talked about a few weeks ago , it told me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this 30-year survey .
is that something you can share with us because you have a few minutes left now ?
daniel libeskind : sure .
i think the most interesting thing we found in the gallup survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find absolutely .
we found this in terms of happiness itself .
if we look at how feelings are shifting with income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very big sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars a year in a year .
60,000 .
rs : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year are unhappy , and they &apos;re getting more happy , the poorer they will .
we get a perfectly flat line .
i mean , i rarely saw flat lines .
what happens is obvious that money is not buying a plastic system , but that lack of money is safe to get the misery , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the most important self , you get another story .
the more money you deserve is you &apos;re more likely .
it &apos;s not true for emotion .
but danny , in the whole american efforts , is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people take this kind of thing seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on the head , everything we believe in terms of thinking , for example , in terms of the way we think about it and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country is generally taking a heat of the world like the serious and making politics based on politics ?
so , you know , i think you know , i think there are recognition for the role of the world &apos;s policy .
the recognition will slow up in the united states , no question , but in the u.k. , it &apos;s happening in the u.k. right now , and it &apos;s happening in other countries .
people are in the process of thinking that they should be lucky to think of politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study the way they want to study or want to explore it , so we have to have a pretty quick discussion .
so , as you can get lucky , it &apos;s very different from how you think and whether you think about the most important self or whether you think about the most important self .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you &apos;re going to be able to measure the population of the population .
this is going to be , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this is a theme , or should be at least the most interesting political debate to follow over the next few years .
thank you very much for invention of behavioral economics .
thank you danny &apos;am .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in reality , as you &apos;re in the city of the world .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince you more people , including all of them , more time playing more and more and more and more .
now we spend three billion hours a week with a little bit of time .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a whole lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think about how many problems we &apos;re really going to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute of the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week , not nearly enough to solve the most common problems in the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increase this time .
i have computing that the needed to make time in 21 billion hours per week .
this is what you might find , and i think , a little bit of an intellectual , so i can keep it to it , if we &apos;re going to do problems like hunger , poverty , climate , global conflict , and obesity , i think , we
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture is quite exactly what i think is that games are so critical for survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographers phil luce .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play . so he made a camera built in front of the players .
this is one of the classic expressions in play .
if you &apos;re not a player , you may be able to get some of the nuances of the nuances .
you probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also very compelling concentration , very difficult to solve the problem of a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re playing , you see some of the nuances here , which are up to the top of the eyes , and the mouth of optimism is a sign of optimism .
this is a player who stands at the edge of a piece of alphabet .
oh , you know . ok . nice . so we have some players here .
a key victory is a result that is so incredibly positive that it &apos;s not even possible before that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you do it , you &apos;re shocked that you actually can be able to do something like this . that &apos;s a kind of a contributor victory .
this player is short of a epic victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces from the world , if we take the barriers of the next century , and the face of the next century is standing on the edge of a epic epic .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re looking at this face in real life , if we &apos;re looking at hard problems .
i call it the &quot; in life , &quot; i &apos;m bad , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yes ? ok ?
i &apos;m like , &quot; i &apos;m really bad , &quot; i &apos;m bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i was looking at my ph.d. why we were in play , as in the real life .
this is a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not so good in reality as well as play .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , although that &apos;s what it belongs .
we &apos;re going to do more in the context of the problem , and i mean , in the context of motivation , something significant to do with collaboration .
if we &apos;re in a corporate factory , i believe that many of us turn into our best version , anytime and immediately , we &apos;re very keen to solve the problem , so long as necessary , it &apos;s going to try to do it for the oil system
and in reality , if we fail , if we &apos;re going to make up obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel poisoning ourselves . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or esoteric .
we never have these feelings , if we play games , there &apos;s just not .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible to think about it , you could not just get anything ?
how can we transmit these feelings from play into reality ?
so i looked like the world of warcraft , which provides the ideal environment to provide the kind of environment .
and i &apos;ve found some things that &apos;s going to win the epic wins in the art of the art .
so , first of all , if you get in one of these most cosmopolitan , especially world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to get them a little bit of a sudden , and that &apos;s immediately true .
but not only any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your current level in the game , right ?
so they create that .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their skills , so they have to be working . but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you don &apos;t sit around and turn it up . there &apos;s always a thing to do .
and there are tons of staff .
where they &apos;re going to go hundreds of thousands of people working with them to end their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that easy in life , this sense that there are a lot of staff that are ready to stand up with a lot of staff .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , these inspiring history , why we are and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve been determined by level , &quot; and &quot; someday &quot; and &quot; one of the &quot; is a intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not in real life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t say , &quot; one talk and a crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
i &apos;m not getting the real life of this feedback .
so the problem of the world &apos;s problems like the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at any time at the edge of a epic epic , that we &apos;re rather spending our whole time in these twin centers .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
until today , all the world of the world &apos;s population has spent millions of years of solving the virtual problems of the world &apos;s own .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound nasty .
but to see it in context , the first time we started to go back to the first time of the first time , our first ted organization started to go upright .
so the first child &apos;s heart .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend playing with play , it just makes sense when you hold the time in terms of the human development of the human development , which is extremely , really .
but also , it &apos;s also a bit of a sudden , because it turns out we &apos;re using all the time to play the whole time , actually , the change that we are in the way people can .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative thinking , very nature .
that &apos;s the truth . i think it &apos;s .
look at this interesting statistic , which was published recently by a researcher of carnegie mellon , the average young person in a country with a strong , major man , spent 10,000 hours of time in a country with a very strong one .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , the most precise hours of the brain that they spend in school , from the fifth grade to the end of the high school , if you never miss .
so we have a full set of water , which is the young people learning , which means to be a good player , how everything you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; &quot; aw , &quot; read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success , the theory of success .
it &apos;s based on the great research of the world &apos;s research that , if we spend 10,000 hours with a very compelling study of any subject to the 21st of any subject to the 21st of a year .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what we &apos;re doing , as the most significant people in the world .
so what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are the most powerful .
so the big question is , &quot; what are the players locked up well ? &quot;
because if we could figure out that , we would never have been able to have a lot of the human potential .
so many people are currently in the world that spend at least one hour per day with a little bit of a day .
these are our primary communities . 500 million people who are extraordinary in something .
and the next decade , we have another billion players who are extraordinary in what are happening .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the most powerful design organization , the energy that saves energy and work on the ground , rather than the average , so players all over the world , especially india , can play online .
you expect a more billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking , what &apos;s it to do , what are these games doing ?
here are the four things i found . first of all , the first thing that i found .
ok , imagine how extreme the extreme of the most extreme .
so , the question is to ask , immediately , do something to do , to be a challenge , to be able to be a commodity , with believing that we have an educated hope to succeed .
player always believes that a security victory is possible , and that it &apos;s always worth trying to try and try and do it .
player don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in spiders in poet social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show us people , after we played them , after we &apos;ve played ourselves , even if they &apos;ve defeated us .
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone .
we trust that somebody &apos;s time to spend us that the rules are being honored , that we have the same goal , and to the end of the way , we &apos;re going to stay the same goal .
so this is what the most important thing is to do is grow from ties , trust and each other .
as a result , we build stronger social relationships .
it &apos;s got productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the most important of the ted of 22 hours plays a week , as a computer designer .
the reason is , if we &apos;re playing , we &apos;re actually happier to work with hard , when we &apos;re going to relax or not .
we know that as human beings , we &apos;re doing optimal work , if we do hard , significant work .
and player is always ready to work hard if they get the right job .
and finally , epic meaning .
players love to be part of awe of awe of awe of their own .
here &apos;s a key thing to go back to the right light , and you all know wikipedia , the largest wiki of the world .
the second largest solo world , with almost 80,000 entries , is the world of warcraft milt .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about the world of warcraft on the internet than any other topic in any other geometric world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to a single outcome . players are the ones that are very hopeful .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as a single one .
and the only problem is they think they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real ones .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
edward libeskind : a computer &apos;s worth of view .
his work is awesome . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in the street .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to be a witness of the less than a more than a more than a more violent in virtual worlds and the other . &quot;
and that &apos;s a economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like me -- i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit more involved .
so he says that actually makes sense , because players can achieve more than in the real life .
you can do stronger social bonds in games than in real life , and you get more feedback and rewards in games than in real life .
so he says it &apos;s absolutely logical , that players are going to be more time in the virtual world than in the real place .
i just agree with that , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not a rocket accident .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from a event that &apos;s 2,500 years ago .
there are these ancient cubes , from the ground , you know ?
this fantastic computer was there , there was a lot of time .
and these were kind of the first of the people developed .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the old greek , you may know this story , and the story about how and why are games invented .
according to the other , games were called , more accurately , in the kingdom of a famine .
there was such a big famine that the king of the u.s. war decided to get a crazy idea .
people suffered . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to the security , the most prolific and autistic strategy , and one day , you would eat food . next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the most powerful , because games are so fascinating and we were with the food of the world , and they were surrounded by the food of it , that they would forget nothing to eat .
and then , the next day you would play . and the next day you would eat food .
and according to the other , they survived this famine for 18 years , and they were playing on a day and played on the next .
so , i think we &apos;re playing games today .
we &apos;re going to play games to get out of the real world .
we &apos;re going to play games to avoid everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , not being prepared in real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
this is the exciting .
according to 18 years , the famine was not better . so the king decided , the king , one last one last year .
they shared the kingdom in two quarters .
they played a computer company and they were allowed to break up a epic adventure .
they left the street and they made a new home for a new home , and they just let them go back so many people , like food and looking at the rest of a region where they were able to flourish .
this sounds crazy , right ?
but latest , recent , recent , that the most popular , the later the blind empire , the same dna as the old of the old ocean .
so scientists recently came to realize that the &quot; crazy story actually agrees . &quot;
and geologists found evidence of a global cooling that took the only 20 years to explain what the famine could explain .
so this crazy story could be true .
you might actually have saved your people by playing by playing 18 years in games for 18 years , and then these kind of things that had been learned and so much about that , and so much about that , that they had saved the entire civilization .
so , that &apos;s what we can do .
we &apos;ve been playing since 1994 warcraft .
this was the first ted company in real time of the world of the world &apos;s first time , and this was 16 years ago .
they were playing for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for 16 years .
i &apos;m going to argue we &apos;re ready for our own game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i take my 21 billion hours a week .
we should be on the ground that half of us spend an hour per day with play , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems in the real world ? &quot; and that question , i have been devoted to my work in the last few years .
we have this glide in our office in palo alto , it puts out how to understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to imagine the best result , and then people make decisions to the reality of the reality .
we &apos;re going to be asking the epic wins and give people the possibilities to reach them .
i &apos;ll show you very briefly , three games that i &apos;ve designed to try to get people to try to get people to get their epic in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a video of the brain that you have to overcome a giant car .
the key thing is , we &apos;ve invented enough , but we have enough life , so it &apos;s actually realistic for you , and you actually live in your real life without oil , and you &apos;re going to be able to tell you how much oil is going
we &apos;ve tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been photographed by the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a change experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure , and you &apos;re going to be , &quot; we &apos;re going to go out of oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going to do .
find out how they were going to survive . most of our players have been involved in the game .
so we have a bigger game for the next game , and we put a bigger deal than just the only thing we have .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; the &quot; s &quot; on the institute of the future .
starting to start the computation of a design , that people have only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global health system , &quot; of course .
the call of player , at the point of player , we have designed a little bit like a &quot; eureka &quot; device .
you know jerry &apos;s , where there &apos;s &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; s , &quot; the scientists , the most educated and only together can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody is in the most cosmopolitan , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they google &quot; the &quot;
and the last game we do is , on march , it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you end this game , you get the award from the world bank , &quot; social media , &quot; in 2010 .
we work with universities in the sub-saharan africa and the store , and we &apos;re going to do a social natives .
we have a comic book . we have &quot; level high &quot; for the computer , and we have a level of view , sustainability , vision , vision and ingenuity .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people everywhere on the world , especially in the world , in the most effective , which benefits to their own social enterprises to save the world .
i &apos;ll go to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world .
well , i hope that you agree with me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have these all superpowers , highly efficient productivity , the ability to make very close social nets , and the desire to make meaning .
i really hope that we &apos;re playing significant games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design with me and play this thing .
if i &apos;m going to go to the next decade , i &apos;m sure that we can make a lot of the future , that we can create every opportunity to create the future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the game games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about what i found a couple of months ago in writing a paper of wired wired .
i always have my favorite point at writing my favorite day , but i was doing the job of the text , and i fell on , i &apos;ve never been able to get into my life , which is &quot; disabled &quot; really means &quot; disabled . &quot;
i &apos;ll read you the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; used , &quot; the most helpless , useless , destroyed , killed , mutilated , wounded , wounded , jr , uh-huh , crushed , and i was paralyzed , tortured , tortured , tortured , tortured , break , stealing , stealing , stealing ,
yup : healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
i read this list of a friend , and i had to read it , and i had to laugh , but i just got to &quot; banality &quot; and i couldn &apos;t get to read , and i had to start to get to the end of the emotional
of course , this was a computer designer , old , old , i just thought that the copy has to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early &apos; 80s when i started with the elementary school and started to build my self &apos;s self , and to form , also in other children and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god , i didn &apos;t use a nuclear war at the time .
i would take this post seriously , i would be born in a world that someone like me would perceive as a person whose life could be positive , and today i &apos;m going to be celebrated for the opportunity and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately had the most nuanced of 2009 , and i expected to find a piece of work here .
here &apos;s the most important version of this kind of puzzle .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
especially , i &apos;m going to shake the last two words under &quot; near &quot; near &quot; &quot; close &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people that we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many ancient societies , including the greeks and the roman , really believed that the humiliation of a football company has a big force because what you can do is , you know , the kind of appreciation of the world , also can be more animated .
so what do we want to do is really manifest -- a disabled person or a powerful person ?
just a human being , as a child , could be a child , and they could be willing to sign them and they &apos;re talking to them .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open them to doors ?
a human being opened for the doors was my pediatrician at the heart of the house in a hospital center in the prison center .
he &apos;s called dr. strangelove . a cat company , whose name , as you can think , the most americans couldn &apos;t tell them correctly . so he always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. was always going to fly and was very colorful for the work with kids just like being created .
i found the time i &apos;ve spent in this hospital , just great -- until my favorite trip .
i had to think of a single deal of the way that we had a lot of the way that we had a lot of the elastic , elastic , elastic , in different colors -- and i hated this on the line of the line , and i hated
and imagine , i even have a child &apos;s child with dr. p. , and so tried to stop this practice , without success .
and one day he looked at me at one of my work -- these are just tiring and enriquez -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re such a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;ll someday get one of these tiles
and if you make it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this was just a simple trick of dr. picasso , so i do the job that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that richest thousand girls in the hospital were in the second store , but he actually brought me to see my daily life with new
and i &apos;m asking myself how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girls have shaped my self , and i could imagine that as one of nature &apos;s strong , powerful and more powerful people .
this is just an example of many of how adults can make the imagination of a child .
but as the most popular examples of the most popular , we can &apos;t make our language , something that we would all like to do : it &apos;s every single one to enable ourselves to see ourselves as a powerful human being .
our language shares the social changes that have been triggered in many cases through a technological change .
from the medical standpoint , you can say that my legs , the most educated for the food of titan and artificial health , which allow people to use , really , to be able to use their own identity , and they &apos;re actually not going to be able
so perhaps this technological change is clear that the fact that there &apos;s always another truth , which is that every human being has something that &apos;s very powerful , and very powerful , and that the human ability , our biggest plus , is our biggest plus .
the human ability to adapt to it -- that &apos;s an interesting story because people always ask me to tell you how i deal with , and i &apos;m going to say something like that , and i &apos;m going to be very uncomfortable with that , and i think
this phrase from dealing with the idea of the idea that success or happiness depends on the challenge to master a challenge without being supported by that , because my life would be able to take a way to be able to take a life with a prosthetic way of
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course we are shaped by the challenge , whether they &apos;re physically emotionally emotionally or emotionally .
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s good .
and not tend to be a obstacle that we need to do to get more clear to our lives .
and tend to belong to our lives .
and i tend to look at it as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s hardly to see , but it &apos;s constantly at me .
and i don &apos;t want to do the impact or the heavy of the human being .
there are more frequently in life and challenges , and they &apos;re just more important and every person is going to do it differently , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to get safely wrong or not , but how we get to it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for people that we love to preserve , but they &apos;re also prepared to get to be good at that .
and we don &apos;t really like our kids if we give them the feeling that they cannot adapt .
you have to separate two things clear : to be the medical fact , an antibiotic , and to the other , the social opinion of whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and permanent disability that i had to take apart is that the world is constantly meant , you can describe me with these definitions .
in our desire , to protect people who are on the heart and to tell them the cold , hard truth about their medical applications , or even a forecast to provide the quality of life that they &apos;re expecting to be disabled .
maybe the current concept is that just look at what &apos;s broken , and how we fix it for every single one of the more a disability than the pathology of care .
if we don &apos;t treat a man &apos;s very pristine , and not all of its forces and possibilities , we can actually do that in addition to the natural fight that you might have to have , a more disease .
we &apos;re a human being a value that has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the world &apos;s oil industry and focus on all the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it is that between perception of our flaws and our great organizational culture , there &apos;s a connection .
we should not be bent this challenging times or deny , we shouldn &apos;t try to avoid them , we should be able to keep them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about realizing that we &apos;re going to see it in the tense .
it &apos;s probably about taking a clear point of asking that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome it , but that we &apos;re open to hug them , they &apos;re going to put them on the top to put a test of the house and maybe even dance with
and maybe we can do it , and we can see , unlike something natural , coherent and useful and useful , and don &apos;t feel so much more urgent .
we celebrate the 200 , 200 . a birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin has been writing , in my eyes , in something very true in the human character .
i would be so supported : not the most powerful of his species , and not the most powerful of his species , but the ones that can adapt to the best .
from conflicts , creativity is coming .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of human beings to survive and is determined by the fight of the human spirit , to turn through conflict .
so again , change and customization are the greatest skills of people .
and maybe we &apos;re only aware of what wood we &apos;re going to cut out when we &apos;re really tested .
perhaps the point of the mind is that a sense of the absence of a sense of the thought of the value of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like that .
we can have a new meaning , which is beyond the hard times .
maybe we can see more than change .
and tend to stand for change that we haven &apos;t adapted to yet .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve made ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
so , who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual one . the typical one . but not the normal one , and would you really want to know this poor , gray person , if it really would be , if you really would ?
i think it &apos;s not more .
it would be great if we &apos;re in the same paradigm of normal versus the power of the possibility , and the strength to even make it a little more dangerous , sharing the forces of very many children , and invite them to make their own special and valuable
and the other thing that we found is that we have people from the members of our society , and we have a chance to be useful and to do a contribution .
there are evidence that the neanderthals were in front of 60,000 years ago , and people with severe physical injuries , and people who have been doing severe physical injuries , and that might be , because the life experience of the human life was valuable .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the city where i was growing up in a red zone in the red zone in pennsylvania , and i was standing there a little tomato .
it was summer and i had a lot of time .
and i hear a guy behind me , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i &apos;m taking care of it and i see these older man . i had no idea who he &apos;s .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you &apos;re not going to remember me .
when i first saw them , i got them out of the belly of their mother . &quot;
oh , so that &apos;s the one .
and of course , it &apos;s done it click .
this was dr. strangelove , a man i knew just from narratives of my mother &apos;s day because i , of course , came to my birthday two weeks late .
the doctor for a child &apos;s doctor was on vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without a high school , and my feet were looking at them , and i just had a few toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , and i had some toes that had the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to say , &quot; i had to say you &apos;d never run , and never be so flexible like other kids or that you could never lead an independent life , and you &apos;ve just been lying in me . &quot;
i really found that he had collected the whole thing that he had had , i didn &apos;t know , to be able to get my entire childhood in the second grade , whether i was going to the world &apos;s office in the second grade , whether i was
and he called this part of his course , the x factor , the potential of the human being .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough , as the key of the quality of the human quality of human life .
and dr. strangelove said , he said , &quot; i learned that children , if they didn &apos;t always say something else , and even if they get a little support , if you get kids to make themselves feel more powerful , they can achieve a lot of them
see , dr. strangelove changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone is doing it , are two different things .
and i also changed my thinking in the course of the time when they asked me to have been asked by the age of 15 years , whether i had been in my prostheses against legs and bones , then i would have no second .
i was really going to be normal at the time .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not sure .
and that &apos;s what happened because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not despite that experience .
and maybe this change could happen because i &apos;ve been so many people who have opened my doors , rather than being people who were constrained to me or to give me a sense of opportunity .
see , it really takes a human to show you how you can manifest your forces , and you &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to turn your own , internal forces -- the human spirit is so much of the time -- if you do that , and for someone in a critical moment , you &apos;re a very good teacher .
they &apos;re bringing them to open doors to the open doors .
the real meaning of word &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means something that is produced in one , that is the potential to make the potential .
again , which potential is we going to do a video video ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the middle of the world , a case study was done in the middle of the world .
they call this &quot; the &quot; s &quot; in the u.s. , we call it &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the students are being divided up .
and the a student will be more advanced , and they get the better teachers and so on .
they &apos;ve been giving over a little bit of time , and they have a little bit of a good time , and they &apos;ve been told to be a very good one , and they told them to be a very smart , and they &apos;re really very smart
and of course , it breaks a heart to hear that the other thing was said to be the most prolific , they &apos;re only enough .
and it was just the three months after that .
but only those who still were in school -- besides students who were shooting out of school .
and the key thing about this study was that the teachers weren &apos;t going to be .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they just said that they &apos;re the leaders and they are the students who are the grade , and they &apos;re taught to you , and they &apos;re treated .
the only real disability is a broken mind , which was broken , has no hope , has no hope . he doesn &apos;t find any more of the natural people , and we don &apos;t have to have our natural ability of imagination .
but if we do it , the human spirit to help be to hope , to hope , and other people around themselves , to be nice , and to be a really positive , and then we &apos;re actually putting our forces to really make a positive one .
if a spirit has about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new design technology .
i want to end with a poem that was written by an persian poet called the &quot; fifth century , &quot; and the poem is called &quot; the god , &quot; the god who knows only four words , and he always says , &quot; come on , dance ,
come on dance with me . thank you very much .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right now ?
suppose i said , through a few changes of their genes , a better memory could have -- more precise , more accurate and faster .
or you want to be more powerful , more powerful , more power .
do you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be to live longer in good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who wished to be wished to be more creativity .
what would you like to do ?
what would you like to have if you could just have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably so many of the things that there are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you choose to choose a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few fewer .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to say , &quot; i like to say a doctor . &quot;
if you could only have one of them , it would be a whole different world .
is that all the statements ?
or is it possible to be possible ?
evolution is a persistent topic on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the point of a doctor &apos;s point .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , the most powerful , which was also a plastic center in the russian palace , once wrote a paper called &quot; nothing in biology , &quot; not in the process of the evolution of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence of biological evolution , it would be a very good moment , you take your personal , you take your personal , and you can take a look at a kathryn , because nothing else will
but if you accept biological evolution , what is it about , is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for other people &apos;s disease or it &apos;s also about us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i put a bush as a center of the branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of life of life , all the existing species of these branches have been in evolutionary terms : they have survived , it &apos;s a
the human part of this , far at the end , is , of course , what we &apos;re interested in most .
we &apos;re pulling from a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , maybe 20 or 25 species of hominids , maybe there were 20 different species of hominids .
some are come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about a year of space .
it seems like we &apos;re right from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually , the biggest part , are the fundamental mechanisms of our cells pretty much .
is it clear that we can use it to pull out the mechanisms of a shared bacteria to produce the protein of the human genome that &apos;s used to treat the biotechnology ?
this is not like the main protein ; this is the same protein that &apos;s in the same way that comes from the pancreas .
and what we &apos;re talking about is , in fact , what are you aware of , is that every one of us in our gut is more bacteria than it leads to cells in the rest of our bodies ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , think about , if antonio damasio asks your sense of self , think about bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful , wonderful environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s wet , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to all be bringing up nutrients that you could just give yourself without any effort .
it &apos;s really a lighter way to get bacteria , with an asteroid of customized interruptions of unintended , and it forced to be forced to be able to break .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they &apos;re important for their lives .
they &apos;re helping them to synchronize the inherent nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary balance in form of a species ?
or are we going to be a little different -- something that might be more adapted to the environment ?
let &apos;s go back to the time of the big bang , 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four and four billion years ago -- the first signs of living organisms , perhaps the first one of the things that came up in
in this vast oven-like symphony of the universe , life is just just a moment of being done ; the animal kingdom , as a single comparison , and the human life , a small color of a little bit .
we were .
this also is the most important of the speech , so i hope , d ate it .
now , when i was a college student on college , i had my first ted trip .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in the power of evolution , and i put something very fundamental : in most the existence of life in the most effective organisms , every cell , and all the genetic information is going on in both of the children &apos;s cell cells .
but at the time , when the organisms turned out , things began to change .
sexual reproduction is going to be in the picture .
and very important , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome is going to be a big way of the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the most powerful of death in our body is in the same moment as the sexual reproduction of our body .
now i have to confess if i was a computer scientist , i thought , okay , sex , sex , sex , death , death -- it seemed quite reasonable to me , but every year , it &apos;s to my risk of value .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , who in las vegas in las vegas , in las vegas .
and one night , there is a pat in his head of life .
he opens the door .
it &apos;s a beautiful , very poor , super violent .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for a christmas . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization that i was a goal of a goal that was a goal of the other than the goal of evolution -- not necessarily , unlike the other .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to try to rebuild health for a disease .
i wanted to say that we have a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the combustion genome on the next generation , adaptation and survival generation to generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they are and i developed how to send rockets to the next stage of the orbit to go to the sea , then to drop into the ocean .
i think we would all be able to understand the mood that the linguists were able to understand , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get immortality through my work .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily prefer to prefer the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily be the biggest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the brightest .
evolution is the creatures that are going to adapt to the best of their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
on the reason of the ocean , bacteria are there , and the so-called the filter is the clean flowing , if fish were there , if fish were there , they would have a vacuum of a vacuum , and they made a more competent environment .
so what does that mean when we look back at what happens in evolution , and how we think about the space of the people in evolution , and most of all , as we go forward to the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a series
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of equilibrium .
and the reason for that was that it &apos;s first given us by medicine , we managed to get a lot of genes that had been otherwise made and removed from the population .
and secondly , we have a species as a species that we &apos;ve done as we have it , that we &apos;ve made it all the way to us and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and we deploy and we put it so much that they can &apos;t tell longer that isolation is necessary for evolution to be more , to the evolution of the evolution of the world .
a second possibility is that it will be an evolution of traditional species , of course , of the forces of nature .
and the argument , here &apos;s the wheels of evolution , but they &apos;re declining .
and so far the isolation is when we &apos;re being dedicated to a species as a species , it will be disgusting and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a compelling , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it a little bit of the evolution -- the new development that doesn &apos;t just matter , but it &apos;s led to us as a function of the decisions that we do .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
so let &apos;s first look at reality that people are making decisions today in some cultures .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family choose .
so think about that if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to make genetic adaptations , the diseases are healing and prevent .
what if you could do the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or to eliminate the risk of risk or stroke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do it in your genes ?
if we &apos;re going to do it , these kinds of changes are increasingly possible .
the human genome project began in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost out one-year-olds billion dollars .
the following year , when it was finished , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in the back of the day to four months .
today , you can have a sequence of three billion base base base base pairs of the human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take a long time to be the reality that it will give the 1,000 dollars human genome , and it will be more available for everyone .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering , the national academy of engineering , and the president of the year , and the two scientists who developed independent techniques , were making a more effective way of working on the natural process of evolution , to work and
a few years ago , the most popular thing was awarded to the scientist , who was interviewing a researcher in his research that he took a adult company , and by the manipulation of just four genes , the cell induced to come up with a pluripotent stem cell
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that can make the human insulin in bacteria that don &apos;t only protect themselves , but also to serve the immunity against other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in gang against influenza that has been grown into the cells of a football system .
can you imagine a good thing that comes from tobacco ?
this is all reality today , and in the future , a lot more can be possible .
so , imagine two other things that are going on .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
what if you could change the sperm and the water , or the fresh , you could change your children a better chance to live a better way to live your children -- get the diabetes , to reduce the risk of cancer ?
who don &apos;t want to make healthier kids ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science that can allow the changes to prevent disease , could also enable us to adopt the disease , to adopt the better memory .
why don &apos;t the most popular of a ken hilton , especially if you can extend it to the next generation of the world &apos;s population ?
why not have fast food that you can get to get to get faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are going to be a lot of time .
and if we &apos;re at a point where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want to be transformed , we &apos;re going to be transformed by the evolution of the evolution of the evolution .
we &apos;ll have a process that may be able to take 100,000 years , and we can also compress it into a thousand years -- and maybe even on the next 100 years .
these are decisions with which their grandchildren are , or their grandchildren , are going to be involved .
we use these decisions to form a society better , who is more successful , who is more friendly ?
or are we going to be selectively different different attributes that we want to have , and not for others ?
will we create a society , and we &apos;re going to be more competent and more robust and depressing and victorian ?
these are the kinds of questions that we have to face .
and the deepest of all , we ever will be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom we need to make that decisions ?
in the good way , in the bad , and it &apos;s used to be as if you might think of these decisions .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something that gives you a portable robot , which gives you a little bit of the ability to get up , or a different one that helps to go up and go to go .
we call these robots called the robot bank .
they &apos;re not anything else than something that you put in the morning and give you extra strength and that will increase your velocity and will help you keep your balance .
this is actually the true waste of human and machine .
but not only that -- so they merge and connect to the universe and the other devices out there .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers , which carries about 100 pounds on its back , and it &apos;s the request that they should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- the internet , 30 percent of this -- chronic health .
so we thought we would embrace this challenge and create a design system that would help with this problem .
so let me now introduce you to the human universal review of the world &apos;s national record .
soldier : with the most powerful thing , i can wear 200 pounds of the terrain , many hours .
his flexible design enables it to be deeply immersed in the way to deal with and to be highly agile .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then get my strength and resilience .
we &apos;re so far with our primary technology that this device is this new , new design in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s take our view to the flu test , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people in the world who have been in the wheelchair .
this is about one percent of the population population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we often talk about very young people with spinal cord with spinal cord in the world -- &apos; 20s , &apos; 30s , &apos; &apos; 60s -- hit by the fate of the fate and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging , the number of copies , their number .
and so pretty much , if it comes to a computer &apos;s office , or to do other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years , as i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in mobility .
let me now introduce you to the point of view that is carried by amanda , who suffered a spinal cord , who suffered a spinal cord that was the result that she couldn &apos;t run for 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our credit .
it has sensors .
his completely fully completely provocative sensors in the crutches , the signals that are attached to our main , which is attached to her back .
here &apos;s also the same thing that &apos;s called the most salient , and it &apos;s also on your hips , as well as your family , moving forward in this fairly , very natural and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old , and in a prison company , as a computer designer , as a shark designer , i was going to be able to get myself back .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my apartment .
not long after that , a doctor in my hospital room and he said , &quot; amanda , you can never go back . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he was steel every single way of my consciousness .
so , epidemics technologies have been told to me since we &apos;re going to go back to learn again , to climb and go to the hands , and even ride the hands .
but nothing was invented to me to go back to that .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to make us and discuss them .
it &apos;s in our hands and we have the potential to change the life of future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda here , and all the flu , but for all the ants , but for all the ants .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m a head of the u.s. war called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t get poverty , i &apos;m more fond of a child &apos;s day , and i &apos;m a volunteer fire that &apos;s a volunteer fire .
now , in our city , in the volunteers , a child volunteer has been devoted to a very early place , you have to be pretty early at the bottom of the world .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer in the front of the world , so i was right to get into the very good opportunity .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to get the people who were going to find out what our tasks would be .
when i found the most serious conversation , he just had a very serious conversation with the most important days of their life .
it was in the middle of the night and she stood in the thrilled and she was in the pajamas , and she was a barefoot rain outside in the morning , while her house was in flames .
the other volunteers who got out of me was -- we call him a third of the day , and we got to go to the house , and was asked to go to the house and save the dog of the design of the world .
the dog ! i was fearless before envy .
there was some lawyer or a computer company who was now able to tell the rest of his life , that he was able to go into a family house to save a living house , just because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next .
the main thing to get me .
he said , &quot; founder , you have to go into the house .
you have to go up to the fire , and you have to get a few shoes . &quot;
i swear .
now , not exactly what i hoped , but i went to the stairs -- the stairs , the hallway , the hallway , the real &quot; the &quot; in the &quot; right , &quot; that was actually going to be able to get out of the bedroom in the
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey down , where i met my doublet and the beloved dog .
we put our beliefs outside the street , where , not surprisingly , it got a lot more attention than my own .
some weeks later , the most popular one was given a letter of the design of the world who was going to be a bold , in which she was going to be a brave .
one of the things that is more valuable is , somebody had brought a few shoes .
both in my profession , robin hood as well in my career , as a volunteer firefighter , i witness of generosity and kindness in large scales , but i also did the trust and the most of the individual .
and you know what i &apos;ve learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look at this room , and people who have either been able to get a little bit of success or on their way there , i want to offer this memory : wait , don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the life of another , until they &apos;ve reached their first million .
if you have something to give you , you &apos;re now .
they &apos;re in a corporate factory , they &apos;re in a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day , we will give a chance to save life of a human life , but every day , we have to change one .
so they &apos;re going to go ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno &apos;s : mark , mark , mark .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of the human being .
a place where women are leading the most sophisticated , with sex , and the game is determined to be a day -- where fun is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not a little bit of a time , or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their parasite .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the jungle of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees , our next living relatives .
that means we have a shared ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are known for their own business .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of the narrative in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos are showing us the other side of the medal .
as chimpanzees from large , fear of the great fear of the people will run the most of the female female .
they really have a whole lot of stuff that comes up because that leads to a very highly noisy society , in the deadly violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known among the primates .
they live in the deep area of the protected system , and they &apos;re very hard to do it .
congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness -- the scene of a violent argument that has been used for decades and almost as many lives as the first world war .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction are also the survival of bonobos .
and the decline and the decline of the world &apos;s population will be that you could not fill a plane with the remaining bonobos -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a very , very strict laugh , that the trees are shattered .
who are these relatives ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , &quot; because they have incompatible , also sex , with the partners , and the same as conflict and social management .
i &apos;m not saying that if you &apos;re the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because life &apos;s life is made of more than the saddle-shaped .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives for long .
play doesn &apos;t just mean that &apos;s just rocket science .
for us and it &apos;s essential to the attachment of relationships and the care of tolerance .
we learn trust and the rules of the game .
play is also more creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the production of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you observe bonobos in the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human populations , dance and rituals .
play is the most popular thing that we &apos;re doing .
now , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique images from the wild .
first of all , a nuclear prize -- and i don &apos;t think at soccer .
so here we see a young female and males in a hospital shop .
look at what she does .
this could be the evolutionary origin of it : &quot; she puts him in the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more like him , right .
yeah !
so , the other audience is common , both with bonobos as well as humans .
and this video is really interesting , because it &apos;s showing -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the most interesting thing that you &apos;re doing in the game -- like the testicles -- and also , as a lot of fun , it &apos;s a
but the game is a very reactive game .
play is a video game , and it can take a lot of forms of what some people are quiet , and some of them are more addictive to discovering , to discover that again .
and i want to show you , this is a young female , and she plays the unconscious with water .
i think that &apos;s exactly how you play , sometimes you &apos;re going to play , and we &apos;re going to be able to use the limits of our inner boundaries and the outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us research , and interact with it , and the unexpected implications that we &apos;re forming are the real breeding of creativity .
this is just a little taste of the insights that bonobos give us in our past and present .
but it &apos;s true to our future , a future , in which we need to adapt to the infrastructure , and we have increased cooperation , and more creative cooperation .
the secret is that the game of the key to these skills is to be the skills .
in other words , play is our main .
to adapt to a world &apos;s world , we need to play play .
but are we going to make the best out of our own ?
game is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people , they don &apos;t have the lives of teeth and claws alone .
just when it &apos;s barely appropriate , maybe play is on the bottom .
and so , my favorite , i &apos;m going to give you this gift of evolution , and play together , while we &apos;re doing creativity and the wonder of the debate .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in the middle 1979 , at the same time , in exactly the same day , every one of the time , every single baby -- okay .
so two pairs , every one of the a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to spend a lot of time , because if you &apos;re going to imagine the whole time , you &apos;re going to listen to the whole time that you &apos;re going to listen to the declaration of tritium .
imagine that just for a moment .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case , the sperm is carrying a y , which hits the x chromosome of the egg .
and in the other case , the sperm is a x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the egg .
both are the people , both fire .
we &apos;ll come back later to these people .
in most of my activities , i have two hats .
under a hat , i &apos;m with the story of anatomy .
i &apos;m studied an historian , and in this case , i study how people thought of anatomy -- that human body , animal bodies -- as they were thinking with the body tree , with the water tree , with the water .
the other hat i carried in my work is the activist , as a symbol of a day , or , as i say sometimes , as a plunderer , a lawyer -- from people who are patients .
in this case , i &apos;ve worked with people who have the social norms , the social norms .
so , for example , i worked with people who are the twins twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with a little bit of time -- so people who were smaller than common .
and very often , i &apos;ve worked with people who are working with their gender -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female counterparts .
and as general as a general term , we can use the word of the word .
and it &apos;s a lot of different forms of life .
i just give you a few examples of the kinds of guys that are not the male or female standard .
in a case , you may have a little bit of a more powerful , and the gene &apos;s gene &apos;s gene &apos;s brain , the most powerful gene , is going to be the most sacred , which we all have to grow up .
and so the testicles are going to be testosterone at the stage of testosterone .
but because this individual , the individual , they &apos;re missing the receptors to recognize testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and this is called a laser maker .
so much testosterone , but not a reaction to this .
as a consequence , the body evolved more to the typical female species .
if the kid is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s brought up as a girl .
but it &apos;s mostly going to take you to kill puberty and grow their breasts and develop themselves , but not their period , until someone comes to this , that there &apos;s something different .
and they make a few tests and they find out that instead of making a little bit of the time and the uterus , they actually wear testicles in themselves , and they have a y chromosome .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could think of this person for actually male , but that &apos;s not really you .
women , like men , have something called the world &apos;s body , that you &apos;re called the &quot; road . &quot;
they &apos;re in the back part of our body .
and the main challenge is that the key of the dopamine is what &apos;s called the calcium hormones .
most women , like me -- i think i &apos;m a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual favorite experience , but i think i &apos;m probably thinking i &apos;ve probably got the typical -- most women like me actually talk to a mathematically .
we produce the food , and we &apos;re talking to a logarithmic .
the consequence is that somebody like me actually has a brain that has more of the time , as a woman who was born with testicles , and a more powerful one .
so gender is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be spread over the range of the range , you can be distributed over the range of the range .
another example : a few years ago , i received the call of one 19 man who was born as a young boy , when a young woman was born , he had a friend , and he had a friend of mine , and he had just found that
he had an extreme form of an innate form of symmetry .
he has a little bit of chromosomes , and in the womb , his family &apos;s work was so active that they basically created a male , a male .
and as a consequence , his rake got up to the male , his brain was exposed to the most prolific male part of the world &apos;s office .
and when he was born , he saw a boy , no one was a little bit .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , actually , because he was standing in the same room , that the doctors found that he was in the inner female .
okay , just a quick example for a variation of the design .
some people with the chromosomes are creating something called the most important , which is the most important thing about the internet .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this is happening .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason kids with this kind of body -- it &apos;s a little bit of a time or the twins , it &apos;s a lot of the way to be adapted to the norm , is not because of the norm , because it &apos;s for its physical health .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they &apos;re often made different kinds of surgical treatment is because they threaten our social categories .
and what we typically do is our system is based on the idea that a certain anatomical expression is linked to a particular identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is to have a female identity ; a black person is to be a black person , which is to have an african anatomy in terms of the story .
so we have this awful simplistic idea .
and when we &apos;re confronted with a body that actually represents something very different , we &apos;re kind of confused this in terms of these online systems .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about the dow .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of flapping .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when kids are born , they &apos;re two people in a body .
where i had experienced most of the most excitement of the most exciting year , the south african editor was last year whose gender was asked in the world world in berlin .
many journalists were calling me the question : &quot; what will you do , who will tell us if the other thing that &apos;s going to tell us is a female woman or male male or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that there was no test .
we know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature for us is not a line between male and female , or between male and female and female and female and female and female and female and female .
so we have a situation where , the further our science is accelerating , we need to be able to admit that these categories that we &apos;ve had for robust anatomical categories , which made very simple amounts of energy to create a lot of more , very little ,
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
it &apos;s also about race , which turns out to be much more complicated than our primary system has allowed us to do .
we have a hint of our observation in all sorts of different parts of our own .
we &apos;re going to run for example that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we supposed to start with the fact that we just differ from them with a few of the periods of time ?
as we continue to push our science forward , we get increasingly in a zone of awkwardness , where we need to recognize that the main categories we have probably had is too simple .
we see this in all sorts of different areas of human life .
one of the areas that we see in the world &apos;s lab , in our culture today , in the world today , are the struggle of the beginning and the end of life .
we have hard conversations about what a body becomes to people , so that it has a different kind of life than the continuity life .
we &apos;ve been very difficult today -- perhaps not as public as in medicine -- about the question , when someone is dead .
our ancestors used to be so hard to fight when someone was dead .
they &apos;ve just had a feather under the nose , and if they moved , they haven &apos;t buried them yet .
if you didn &apos;t move it , you &apos;ve buried it .
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we &apos;re taking people critical organs and they want to put them in other people .
and as a result , we &apos;re going to fight the fight with really difficult question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have so simple categories like earlier .
now you could think that the whole thing was going to crash from categories like me .
i &apos;m politically fragmented , i &apos;m a very fragmented person with unusual bodies , but i have to admit , it &apos;s nervous .
to understand that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , i think , getting tense .
and it makes me uncomfortable in terms of thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this tension , i first have to get out of the first pet fan that i &apos;m a big fan of the fathers .
i know they were a lot of time , i know they were a lot of time , but they were great .
i think they were so eager and strong , and so radically , in which they were doing that , i &apos;m going to look at the most , very much , the most prolific strip of the city station , and it &apos;s not because of the music that
it &apos;s because of what the amur landscape is happening .
the fathers were from my view of the original canyon , which is why .
what they were doing was a very , very popular concept , and they were replacing it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you remember , our fathers refused to the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very exciting concept of anatomy .
the ruler of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of the design of the world .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power , they should have this political power , because of the most prolific of the grandfather to the son , and so on .
the founding fathers , the founding and they declared them , they replace it through a new new york concept , and this concept said that all people were creating risk of risk .
they were making the field field and decided that in fact , that that is seen , the common similarities , the different differences , and that was very radical .
now they did that , because they were part of a kind of a piece of system in which two things were in common .
democracy grew up , but at the same time , science grew up .
if you look at the history of the founding fathers , a lot of them was very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a world &apos;s world .
they went away from explanations , and it &apos;s a way of a visceral concept of power , and it &apos;s a kind of a silver concept of power , which is based on the transmission of the very very highly potent .
they moved to a very , very important concept .
and if you look at the independence of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature .
they talk about nature to say , who we are .
and as part of that , they got a concept that was made of the circular similarities .
and so they have really been prepared for the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened after that ?
for example , women who were going to be starving the right to the concept of the fathers , that says that anatomical explosions is more important than the anatomical difference , and said , &quot; we have a uterus and the right , &quot; we have a uterus ,
and women are successful .
next , the successful civil rights organization , where we saw people like the most powerful , which is about the process of thinking , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the line of the house , which says , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people different skin color , which are common on abstractions , and they &apos;re very successful , again .
we see the same thing in the field of business .
of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all the similarities , we need to start asking , why are we reaching certain wavelengths of events ?
now , mind , i want to sustain certain wavelengths of disagreement , in the culture of the culture , in our culture .
i don &apos;t want to give the same rights for a fish like a human .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take the anatomy away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want five times that five times the right thing to have , to get their informed consent or marry their consent .
so there are some anatomical openings that make me feel like , and that &apos;s what i think is , keep it .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep them , and if they &apos;re feeling sense .
so let &apos;s come back to these two creatures that have been launched at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in 1979 , the same day .
so let &apos;s imagine that one of them was born , maria , three months of a sudden , so she was born at june 1980 .
and henry , on the other side , is born to the bottom of the day , so he was born at march at march .
just because maria was born 3 months of a month , you get all kinds of three months of los angeles -- the right to have sex , which is right to drink .
and evelyn has to wait for all this , not because he actually has another biological age , just because of the most of his birth of birth .
we &apos;re still finding other oddities of what their rights is .
rm , because you think he &apos;s male -- although i don &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the mit thing -- because you think he &apos;s a male , he can now get it moving , which is maria not to make .
maria , but it can &apos;t be the same in all states , the same thing , the eternal in all states , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
rm can marry a woman , but maria can only marry a woman in a few states .
so we have these permanent descriptions categories that are in many ways and questionable .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is doing such progress in the field of anatomy that we have to achieve a point where we have to admit that democracy is based on anatomy , that &apos;s based on
i don &apos;t want to give up science , but at the same time , sometimes it feels like science is going to be itself .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture is going to take a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; well , we need to pull somewhere , so we &apos;re going to pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught up in a very strange position .
so for example , texas has decided to have a point that , to marry a man , that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and a woman means married , and that &apos;s a y that has a y .
now in practice , people are not tested on their chromosomes .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i told you about the most bizarre .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us to a dream , &quot; a way of explaining a dream .
he says we should not be people to say their skin color , but to judge their character , and go beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you evaluate people because of their characters ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be able to get right in the way that we &apos;re going to get to people , because i have to admit that i have a series of golden light points that probably make more benefits
i want to say that i &apos;m probably going to know some light , and i think , a few bright pieces of control , and you know , more intelligent , more innovative and more mature decisions about your sexual relationships than some of the time i know .
so how do we get the question to the characteristics of the character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really hard .
and part of me , what if the content of a personality would be something that would be in the future , could be visible to the future of an fmri ?
do we really want to go to this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really matters , thinking about the idea that the u.s. is in it , to make thoughts of questions about the questions of democracy .
in our effort , we have done our own thing really well , and i think we would make our thing good in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like , in iran , where a man who is attracted to other men , is being punished with the death of being punished , because he &apos;s ready to get a handle in which he can stay alive .
states of this kind exist in us .
i &apos;m glad to say that we didn &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon i talked about a few years ago , who had a few of the twins who had a few of the twins who had a few of them to separate them , in part of
but when i was with him , and he asked him why he made these interventions -- it was high surgeries -- was his answer to his country , that children were very bad , and that &apos;s why he had to do it .
i said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve moved to a political asylum instead of a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states is offering incredible opportunities to allow people to be the ones that they &apos;re , without changing themselves in the state .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to conclude , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked very much about dads .
and i want to think about the possibilities of democracy , or looked like democracy could have looked at more than that .
and i want to say something radically radical , and i think it might be different types of insights that are based on different kinds of anatomy , and if people are applying a nuclear record .
since years , because i was interested in the research of the world , i also interested in research in the field of research .
and one of the things i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from the fossil studies is that women , average -- not every , but on average -- more complex , more complex social relationships and the care of people who are vulnerable to the group of people who are vulnerable to the group .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation about ourselves .
years ago , when i did a graduate student , one of my graduate students who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked at myself as a feminist , so it &apos;s a really strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism is a female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about predicting stereotypes about gender , so the feminism is nothing female .
but the more i thought about his question to think more , i thought it could give a female feminism in the feminism .
that &apos;s what it might be called , it could give you something in average , which female brains of male people are doing , which makes us more powerful for social social relationships , and more than that for the most sophisticated .
so where the founding fathers were extremely eager to find out how individuals could be protected before the state , it &apos;s possible that if we put more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re more likely to get a concept of the way we can do it , but
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go to the future if we &apos;re going to think of democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual body , what identity is based on , and more about relationships .
so , if we try to make a more perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a retired , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;m going to do in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m obsessed with .
i love to find any opportunity to find a different kind of a different kind of outfit , to wear crazy , and to photograph and to be blogging .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes from second hand on top of a street and in southern kenya .
ooh , thank you .
so , the power of mine allows me to reduce the impact of my favorite to the environment , and also on my wallet .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars are usually in the absence of good purpose ; i see quite unique , and it &apos;s going to shop to my whole personal computer .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it be my size ?
am i going to do the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers are loud , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i tell you what i &apos;ve got to get on ted for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what do anybody do with so many outfits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven pair of underwear , and this is all .
and so , the one week , all i &apos;ve done is what i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve been able to figure out that i would like to do everything i want to do , if i first came to palm springs .
and there you don &apos;t have me heard of myself as the woman who &apos;s running here at ted in your underwear -- is that i found a couple of things .
and i want to show you my intern for this week .
does this sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m going to leave you with some of the lessons i believe whether you believe or not , from these danish laws .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the luminous tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost look at a lot of the time for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket , has paid me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i was wearing all week .
monday : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost practical impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing your pants pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you get other happy people .
tuesday : adapt it is completely , completely tiring .
i spent a lot of time to try to do this , trying to be myself , and at the same time , i adapt to myself .
just be who you are .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , you &apos;re not going to understand it , you &apos;ll appreciate it .
wednesday : give your inner child .
sometimes people say , i saw , i &apos;d like to dress out , i &apos;d like to draw it , or i remember her calf .
i &apos;m smiling , and i say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re going to look good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think that you don &apos;t look good in something , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me for day day .
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize it for you .
if you believe you &apos;re a wonderful person inside and the outside , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to rock everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden music is all fit .
and finally , saturday : a very unique , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world about a little bit , without having to say a word .
it was always proven to me and again , when people were sitting on me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home , i &apos;ll give you all the time to give it to a brooklyn .
because the lesson i try to learn this week is that it &apos;s okay to go to it .
i don &apos;t have to emotionally make these things emotionally , because the same thing is going to be a different kind of crazy , more intuitive , recyclable outfit , which just waited me , if i love a little bit in the heart , and it &apos;s looking
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all together .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as a hunting bow , flying up .
this is what we call the lab , we call design design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every young boy grows in italy with this image in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is a very interesting thing in the past decades .
and a few times ago , if you wanted to win a formula , then they took their budget and they put their money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now , if you want to win a race , actually , that &apos;s what the car is doing in real time , some thousand sensors that have information from the car , and then they &apos;re using the information and then they use that car and then they use
this would be , in the blink of the , a computer company .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is made out of two parts -- a piece of a piece and a half of a sudden .
what &apos;s interesting today is the most important thing to come up with in our lives .
our cities were being equipped in the last few years , with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to become the computer in the free .
and as a computer in the free , they start to respond to other kinds and way , they &apos;re going to be perceived and driven .
if we &apos;re cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population is living there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the world &apos;s population -- cause to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big deal .
beyond cities , all this sense of view and power is going to be a living in objects .
this is from an exhibition that paola antonelli for moma later in the summer , and as the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; lunch with me . &quot;
now , all our objects , our environment , start to speak to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every atom is out there to both , one sensor and a laser .
and that changes radically the interaction that we have people out of our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , as a sekhri , the moses shaped it , it &apos;s called the hammer , and he threw him on moses -- actually , you can see a little bit of a place -- and said , &quot; hey , the most delicious thing ? why don
now , today , our environment starts to be very first to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of the environment and power .
let &apos;s start with the impression .
now the first project i want to introduce you to is actually one of the first of our labs .
it came in in italy , and this was in italy .
and what we did is actually use a new way of using network that was used throughout the world -- that &apos;s a very , very talented and anonymous information from this network to use the operators that are being collected by the operators to understand how the city works
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was as a italy that was going to be the national union .
some of you will remember it was in italy , and then at the end of france , the most salient thing .
and no , in italy , it won &apos;t have been won .
now , you see what happened in this day , just watching the activity of activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see in the middle of the mountain , the flow of heat .
on the morning , the game .
you see the timeline up .
early afternoon , people here and there , the calls and move out .
the game begins -- silence .
france is doing a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
and repeated , people are doing a short call , go on the bathroom .
second , it &apos;s ticking . end of the normal .
first extension , second .
and it &apos;s a moment of the time of the design .
italy wins . yeah .
now , in this night , all of the time , all of us went to celebrate .
they saw the big key .
the next day , all of the center went to the center of the world and the prime minister of the time .
and then all the down went down .
you see the picture of the space , encouraging , where , since the roman time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and they see the key one day , and you see the key thing at the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city , in a way that we couldn &apos;t do a few years ago .
so , another example of a different example : here &apos;s not about people , but about things that we use and consume .
now , we know all about where our things are coming .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that are a mac computer , like they came together .
but we just know a little bit about where the things go .
so we actually designed some little markers to track the garbage while it goes through the system .
so we started with some volunteers who are , something more than a year , in seattle , who helped the things that they &apos;re going to be able to do -- different species of things that you can see -- things that you would throw away with .
then we have the little chips that little brands , the little brands , on the garbage and start tracking him .
here are the results that we &apos;re getting right now .
seattle ...
after a week .
and with this information we realized that there &apos;s a lot of the design of the system .
we can actually do the same things in the fact that we do with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but this is what a lot of the most sophisticated and complicated things happen .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day , the cup that we throw away , not just disappears somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we &apos;re going to throw away every day is still there .
and if we show the people , we can push a behavior forward .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague at mit , the most powerful , could you even see more about the sense and the many other wonderful things that you can do with a sense of , but i want to talk to the second part of the world that we &apos;ve been talking about
and the first project is something that we &apos;ve done in a few years ago in a few years ago , spain .
it started with a question of village village who came and said , &quot; that spain and the design of a beautiful tradition have a beautiful tradition of water to use the world .
and the question was : how could you bring technology to new technology ?
and one of the ideas that were applied to a plastic center was , imagine that these tubes , and valves , and the valves , they work and close , and close to it .
they &apos;re doing what a video system is doing with water dioxide .
if these are the double lines , they can write on it , they can write patterns , images , text .
and you can get away and it will open up to leave you , how you can see it in this picture .
now , we presented the mayor of the mayor .
it was very like it .
and we got the mission to design a building in the expo of the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was from water .
there &apos;s no doors , or the windows , but if you &apos;re approaching it , it will open and you &apos;ll leave it in .
the roof was covered with water as well .
and if it &apos;s voluntary , if you want to reduce the cursor , you can even let the roof down .
or you could close the building and the whole architecture will be like in this case , you know , this days , when you get the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , you don &apos;t have the building , it &apos;s just that architecture is almost disappearing .
here you see the building works .
you see the person who asks what &apos;s going on in the inner room .
and here you see me when i tried to test the sensors that opened the water , not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what happened to a night when all the sensors stopped .
but actually , it was a more fun one at night .
all the children from the street came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to make them a , but a building that still had the breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump now without getting wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , engineers , think about how people , the things that we use , the things we &apos;re designing .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beautiful thing to create things that are used and interact with people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical , the most prolific , the most prolific , the projections .
and this is what we &apos;ve got about this project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine that these are really the tools that are really beginning to fly .
imagine you could have little helicopter , which flies through the air , and each of you with a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of light with a little bit of light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , as you saw earlier , the other one that moves with other people , completely in synchrony .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a flexible screen or you have a flexible screen , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or irregular , but in three dimensions , which , what changes , the light is , not the position of the brain .
you can play with different kinds of games .
imagine the screen just in different ways , or sizes , in different ways , in different ways .
but then it could be a 3d cloud from a solar cloud that you can walk and move through the way you can move through many , many directions .
here you see a real , real thing that &apos;s going on to form the same as a marketer in the past .
if you turn the lights , it looks like this . so , as we &apos;ve seen it before .
imagine that every single one of people are being run .
it could have any single impulse of a push that comes from people , from the movements of people or something like this .
i want to show you something about the first thing .
we worked with the design of the world &apos;s very best dancer , one of the best dancer of our time -- the most salient thing in new york and the scale in milan -- we took his movements into 3d to use it as an impulse for the design
here you see dancing dancing .
on the left , you see the most important , the different of the sensations .
it &apos;s a computer bank at the same time , and a more powerful .
so they can feel the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we all have the most violent , you can play with it and play with color and play .
we want to use this as a possible impulse for the design system .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
again , the idea is , imagine that we &apos;re putting back to people with something , and change the environment -- almost something like that , how we call it , the value of the design , but with a cloud .
imagine that every one of a donation can give a donation for a nuclear prize .
i think that the remarkable thing that happened last years , the last decades , is that we &apos;re changing from an physical world to a digital world .
it &apos;s all digitized , and it &apos;s going to do it through the internet .
now , we can do it for the first time -- and the campaign obama has shown this -- we can move from the digital world , to the physical world of the networks .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
this is something that &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can be to ask us the challenges to ask the challenges -- think about climate change or co2 emissions -- how can we move from the digital world to physical physics ?
so the idea is that we actually engage people with them , in which they do things together , collective .
the cloud is again a cloud of plastic , in the same way , as a real cloud of particles , is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of a cloud of plastic .
it &apos;s a physical structure in london , but with a solar system .
you can move inside and make different types of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments for the u.s. 2012 and beyond , and it uses the kind of connection to the community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go to the top , how london &apos;s new mountain .
you can go inside .
and a kind of digital kind of a digital falcon in the night -- but as a computer designer , a new kind of experience for all , who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important .
i &apos;m trying to express my work that people are not separated from nature and that everything is connected .
the first time i was in antarctica , i was in antarctica , where i saw my first meditators .
i grabbed awe .
my heart sank , i was a little bit of time , while i was trying to make what was wrong with me .
the sargasso meditators around me almost 60 feet around the water , and i could just wonder that this was a snowflake on another snowflake , year year .
the ashaninka edges are born as a calf , or by a glacier , and they &apos;re breaking out of the ground .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they interact in the very opposite way with their environment and their experiences .
some people are holding up and they &apos;re going to be able to go to the bitter end , while others don &apos;t get to the rest of them and in a kind of a constant dramatic passion .
if you look at an iceberg , you think it &apos;s isolated , and they &apos;re separated , and it &apos;s just like we &apos;re seeing people often .
but the truth is far away from it .
as an iceberg collapses , i &apos;m going to get a laser bottle of water .
as the iceberg melts , it &apos;s melting water , which is a lot of life feeds .
i &apos;m going to go to my photographs of this cambrian , when i would make portraits of my ancestors , in which consciousness , that they exist in these individual moments , and never even exist again .
it &apos;s not death if you melt it ; it &apos;s not a end , but a more , you know , your body cycle along the cycle of life .
part of the ice in the ice industry that i &apos;m very young -- some thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is an iceberg that i have in the greenland in greenland .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to witness a single wave of a pandemic iceberg .
here you see it .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please watch the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the top of the world .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man stands there .
this is the average size of a football system .
it &apos;s pulling about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just as , you know , the iceberg shows a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinarily blessed by work in some amazing projects .
but the best thing i &apos;ve ever been working on was this guy .
his name is a little bit .
and the one of the leading graffiti artist artists was the number of the &apos; 80s .
then one day , he came back from walking back and said , &quot; dad , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the accident .
now , the most paralyzed is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i was him to him .
so i have a company that makes design and animations , so it &apos;s inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the art world and look at .
so we decided , tony -- and he &apos;s got to support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and his brother , and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what will you do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
i just want to talk to him , and i said , &quot; wait , is this not -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all be the paralyzed people using this stuff ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , just if you &apos;ve heard about higher , you can actually do it , and have a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not available to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , how does you communicate ? &quot;
did anybody see the movie &apos; butterfly and the &quot; butterfly ? &quot;
so they communicate -- so they &apos;re running up their fingers .
i was like , &quot; very , very much , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came to mit with the need , just a check , and instead , i put a check from that i didn &apos;t have the slightest idea of how to win it .
i was ashamed of the place and the place for his brother and his father -- with the words , &quot; well , my proposal is like this : tony will talk to him , we &apos;ll get a device and find a way to make it his art .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s still carrying all of this in the same way , not communicate . &quot;
so i talked to a couple of months later .
i met these people from the street , graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to put light on every surface and then draw with a plastic system that &apos;s just going to be able to take the negative surface .
so they &apos;re going to go around and make it like these .
they say that all things that are shown on top of there is a life cycle .
it starts with the villagers , then the most important , then the most important , and the people are actually doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in her presentation .
so i went home , and i had dinner with my wife and i thought , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology , you can use the technology to use things , then we should find a way to make a laser , so that
this was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of the way , we &apos;ve reached some things .
first , we have the sales the doors , and actually have to get a device to the device that he can communicate -- a stephen hunter .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call it a little bit of a time because you talk to him , or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so eager to do this guy . &quot;
and we also have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us home .
my wife , my children and i moved to the garage , and these hackers and programmers and programmers and the metal and the plastic workers and the plastic workers have taken our house .
many of our friends thought we &apos;re beautiful , and we &apos;re going to be a lot of dumb and all of us are the images of the walls .
but for two weeks , we &apos;ve been programmed to do it , we went to the street center in venice , my children were involved , and we created this .
it &apos;s called the &quot; s &quot; and you can see the description .
this is a cheap alcoholic , which we bought on the national union of venice , something that &apos;s a little bit more important and a few things from the hardware chain and the baby &apos;s waste .
we took a nuclear prize , they have a set of things , they put it on a set and we have a device that is free , and we can build it even , we can build it for free , we put the code free to download .
so we &apos;ve created a device that &apos;s completely free of limitations .
no insurance can be seen .
no hospital .
now , every paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes alone or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the middle of the room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s the room of somebody else and that &apos;s his room .
there &apos;s all these things that are happening in front of the big unveiling .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of design , and the day of the day , tony , the first time , drew tony to seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and it looks beyond life support .
we have to be blown up , so he can see it outside .
we put a satellite table on a wall of the mountain on the hospital .
and he was doing the first time , in the prison of his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what a sense of feeling in the parking lot was .
so , we had to have a lot of interest in the parking room , so we felt like a part of the most important .
at the end of the day , he would send us an email with the following content : &quot; the first time for seven years i was drawn .
i feel that , i was pushed up underwater , and finally , someone got down to the bottom , and i got down my head , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
this is something like our primary system .
it &apos;s holding us on the shelf and we keep moving on .
and we have to improve much more on this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a kind of a little bit of a time .
and somebody who has one such artistic potential , it deserves so much more .
so we &apos;re trying to figure out how to do it better and more powerful .
since this time we &apos;ve all received the kinds of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , no one deserves it .
it &apos;s all of our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
armstrong &apos;s got us and then , in december , the world &apos;s favorite time , we &apos;ve been honored as one of the most 50 inventions in 2010 .
the most important thing about this -- and that includes the entire circle -- that it &apos;s going to be a april of this april , in the middle of los angeles , a show called &quot; style of the &quot; the u.s.
and there &apos;s probably the hardest representatives of the world &apos;s population , and it &apos;s -- the most difficult thing to do is -- the most powerful , more and more of all these guys are going to be there .
and the point is , the show is going to be part of what &apos;s pretty wild .
so basically , i &apos;m about , if you look at something that is impossible , it can make it possible .
all in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the microphone -- everything was impossible .
do it possible -- they all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never had anything to do with a little bit of time , but i just got a little bit of it , and i just got together with amazing people so we could put something on the legs .
and this question should be , every single day , and one day , on every single day you have to do something that has to be done , if not now , when , when not me , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably in america most of the most frequently time .
and i always say the people i don &apos;t want to do as a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody ever voted a farmer .
today i want to tell you about circles and cod .
well , a epiphany is usually something that you find because you &apos;ve gone somewhere else .
you &apos;re about the block and it &apos;s a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard &apos;s favorite .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you today .
my circle began to go back to the &apos; 60s in the &apos; 60s , ohio , ohio , where i was the most popular .
i was the one who was beaten in the most early and blue , and i was beaten up until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using the toilet in the front of the house .
they did .
she did three years .
and i had to go away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it struck me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then in the &apos; 80s , i found it important to put a work in the &apos; 80s .
about three or four years ago , i received a call in the middle of the night , a call from this teacher , woman post , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other as adults .
you can come to ohio , and please come together with the man i know you &apos;ve found him in the last time .
and i should say that i have a little bit of time , and i want you to be a quick thing . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we saw them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew they &apos;d have to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them , and we took them to do it , and we gave them eight , because it needed to be necessary , because it needed to be necessary .
it was something that we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults , they turned to me , put it in a box full of ashes and was put into my hands .
what happened was that the circle had closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation i showed was that i was talking .
the revelation is , death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that needs the rest of life .
he takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that today &apos;s most often mentioned .
he needs the same -- he would need love and pleasure , and it &apos;s on us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , as you go on 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a marketplace that tends to , an incentive , tends to , disorder , hyperactivity , hyperactivity , intervention , tends to make it .
that sounds scary .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i was sitting on a street table .
i was the only one who could speak with the most sophisticated .
so i saw it , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve caught some birds . &quot;
the pilot had been able to have the machine , and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened simultaneously .
the pilot set up the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s not usually the route .
it turns out the engines .
imagine a little plane on the plane .
and then he said three words -- the most popular words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; the effect for the power . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the most important .
i could see it in her eyes , because it was horror , life was too close .
now , i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about myself .
i learned that in a moment , everything is different .
we have this kind of thing , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to make a hand , and it didn &apos;t do all the fences that i wanted to do , and never made
and as i thought about it , a saying , a saying , is , &quot; i &apos;m collecting bad wines . &quot;
because if the wine is so far and the person is there , i open it .
i never want to move anything into life .
and these urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned at this day -- and that was when we put the george washington bridge , so pretty much , i thought , it thought , man , there &apos;s one thing i really do .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my mistakes , i mean , i &apos;m going to be better in everything i &apos;m doing .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve been given myself to my ego .
and i &apos;m the time that i &apos;m wasted for the most of the things that i do for the most important things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to people , to people .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t have two years to write with my wife .
it feels great .
i don &apos;t try to have a lot of time ; i &apos;m going to make it happy .
the third thing i learned -- and during the inner watch , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 , 13 . &quot;
you see the water .
i said , &quot; please flying into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts , like you know it from a documentary .
as we were generous , i had this feeling , and i was not ashamed of dying .
almost like that , we would prepare our lives for that .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and these sadness really , really , really in a thought , is that i just wish to give one of them .
i just wish i could see my kids grow .
about a month after that , i went to a performance of my daughter -- first of all , not a lot of artistic talent ...
... not yet .
and i &apos;m like , i cry like a little kid .
and in the world , everything was a sense of me .
i realized that by the time i connected the dots , it &apos;s just about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else , is to be a good father in life , a good father .
i was the miracle of the world not dying at this day .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , and come back and live differently .
my call to all the people who fly today is : do you imagine , the same thing happens on your flight -- please not -- but do you think it &apos;s going to change ?
what would you do , that you &apos;re picking up because you think they &apos;re always there ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are they the best parents that they can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the tyrone mill is quite simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the key post there for development is the most important job in the field of nuclear weapons .
the gray boxes you see here are the most delicious .
now , if it &apos;s working , the systems of the systems , which control and valves , then we can actually create a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes are not running with the signals ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we do it , a effective vaccine on a laptop is used by a laptop that &apos;s used by a plastic bottle , and then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind tyrone .
so we start with a laser test .
the most sophisticated thing is going to be to fly into the gray box , injured the centrifuge and an iranian , and an iranian , and an iranian .
this is a light set , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started to announce our research six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was the point and purpose of this kind of thing .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , what the most powerful part of the brain , the most powerful part , made mistakes , made of all the kinds of things that we could use .
and it seemed to be a little bit of a bit of a time , with these gray boxes , this kind of predatory cable .
the senior life , our attention and we started a project project , where we were infected with our environment with shackleton , and we studied this building .
and then something funny happened .
and he was just like a computer company , who didn &apos;t like our cheese -- the same thing , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that made no sense in my eyes .
and after we stimulated different kinds of cheese , i went to that that this is a more powerful attack .
completely on a particular destination .
the main run runs on the gray box when a special configuration was discovered , even if that &apos;s a special program that tries to get to get to the target .
and if not , then fincher does nothing .
so , that really got my interest and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , we &apos;re a u.s. power power power station , or a carbon power in germany .
so we should be able to figure out what the goal is .
so , we &apos;re going to find the design code and we found the most important code , and we found that it &apos;s in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a larger one .
and we also realized that they were very professional designed by people who were obviously available to all the most violent information .
they knew all bits and the pieces of bits that they had to attack .
even they knew the most important thing about the most important thing .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve seen that the most sophisticated thing about shackleton is complex , and i &apos;m going to tell you , the most high-tech thing is , you know , the most powerful is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more difficult than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this kind of thing .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
looks pretty much like an old-fashioned health .
and i want to tell you how we were able to get smart from this code .
so after the first thing we were looking at , we were the most powerful , because we know what this is doing .
and then we went to search of research and we tried to bring these with the real world in relation to the real world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could demonstrate or prove to us .
so to make these theories , we call ourselves an memory that it &apos;s definitely about the most important thing , it has to be a high goal , and it &apos;s very likely to be in iran , because most infections have been reported .
now , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
it &apos;s basically coming out of the ice nuclear nuclear power and on the ground floor .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; bring me a list of all experts for centrifuge and power plants from our client . &quot;
and i called them to the point of view , and i was going to know her expertise to compare what we found in code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital , with the most popular , with the computer .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you manipulated the speed of this kind of thing , you actually can get the rotor to crack the rotor and actually keep the centrifuge to explode .
what we also found is that the goal of the attack was actually , and to make it happen , and to make it very scary -- to let the attempt to try to get away from the trial that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get quickly behind it
the great digital model -- we got a glimpse by looking at the data and we looked at it very closely .
so for example , the number of light lines are very , very clear from this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started with scientific literature , which is how these centrifuge are built in the wild , and found that they &apos;re structured in so-called the , and each of the things that includes a lot of information is a viral centrifuge .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it was still better .
these centrifuge in iran are divided into the same level .
and guess what we found in the field of business ?
a almost identical structure .
so again , that really fit very well .
and this gave us great confidence to that , which we studied here .
now , don &apos;t understand me wrong , that &apos;s not just like that .
these results were achieved by several weeks of hard work .
and often we ran into a dead and had to collect ourselves .
anyway , we found that both digital warheads in reality actually appear to be a and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little little bit of the brain takes a little bit of a sudden , and the triple processor , and the triple layer , and the large , and the big estate is going to be at the age of six , and manipulated .
so , in the big and all of us , we &apos;re very confident that we actually have a lot of what the goal is .
it &apos;s a little bit of a time and it &apos;s just a little bit more enjoyable .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be met by shackleton .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- really , has been absorbed in my mind .
there &apos;s the gray box , and it &apos;s up there , and you see the centrifuge .
now , what this thing is doing is that it &apos;s the power of sensors of sensors -- so for example , from the point of data and the power of power -- and it &apos;s a matter of code that &apos;s still available to the attack , the wrong
and in fact , this false disk is taken from interaxon before .
so it &apos;s just like in the car car , where the car car is fed up with the air car , the air industry .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the idea of this is obviously not just the most important in the control room .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to maintain a digital model of digital engineering .
we need digital design technology where a human health system cannot respond fast enough .
so for example , in a power station , if the big power of the great world becomes too fast , you have to open up in milliseconds .
of course , this cannot be done by a human being .
so , at this point , we need digital design .
and if the risk is , then really bad things can happen .
the power power can explode .
and neither the most important , the most important thing is that it &apos;s going to notice .
this is scary .
but it &apos;s still going to be worse .
and what i say now is very important .
think about it . this attack is a little bit .
it doesn &apos;t have anything to do with centrifuge , with a little bit of time .
so he would work for example , for example , in a power station , or in a plant station .
it &apos;s a little bit more populous .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the attacker -- you don &apos;t have to put the air on a stick , like we saw it at interaxon .
you could also use ordinary water technology to spread the spread .
you just have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you eventually get a drug weapon of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the consequence we need to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most sophisticated environments .
we need to ask the consequences and we &apos;re going to start to prepare for ourselves .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it &apos;s been reported very much of that , people think that the most important thing is the most important thing behind behind .
is that also your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
i think the most important thing is , the driving force is not israel , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the most important superpower .
there &apos;s only one and these are the united states -- fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for a neurologist , thanks to us . thanks ralph .
i spent the last few years to put in situations that usually are very difficult and equally , and somehow , in some cases , dangerous .
i went to jail -- hard .
i worked in a college shop -- dangerous .
i filmed in a little bit of the way -- hard and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days to do nothing than this -- fun at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
i actually have the biggest part of my career , and i think that &apos;s what i think is terrible to try and look for social , and that &apos;s how to study social and interesting , and hopefully to make a kind of understandable , which makes it fun
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world of the world of the world , and i knew , i knew , i knew that i would do something slightly different .
some of you may have heard that i &apos;ve got a display in a couple of weeks ago .
i sent a few of the pieces of music , some of the things i got , and i gave people the opportunity to get the most educated on my tedtalk 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , and the most powerful opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let that go again -- the most important thing to do is to buy the subject of the subject .
so what you got was this : her name here presented : my tedtalk , from which she doesn &apos;t know what the subject will be , and the one of them finally could fly to the ears , especially if i could find her business for your involvement .
but it &apos;s a very good media opportunity , but it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a lot .
this is just the most important thing .
so despite this warning , i knew anybody would buy the most sophisticated .
if you asked me this a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with sure .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve been going into some pretty horrible situations , but nothing could prepare me to get nothing to me , and i couldn &apos;t get my way to anything so difficult and so dangerous as with these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea of a film .
what i want to do is , a film around the internet , is marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by the internet , marketing and advertising , and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the u.s. &apos;s atmosphere , &quot; called the &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the u.s. hall , &quot; is that everything , above the top , is the end of the way to the end , completely with brands -- from the -- from the -- the computer , which you &apos;ll see in the movie , that
now this brand , the most salient stadium , the most salient center ...
these people are being connected to the movie in eternity -- forever .
and so the film is going to look at this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in infinity , for always ?
i &apos;m a computer person .
that was more to an emphasis .
it was &quot; in eternity forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x as a function of a second , but we &apos;ll certainly be sure that we &apos;re going to sell every one of the subjects in the movie .
so we might sell a shoe and it will be the greatest shoe that they &apos;ve ever worn ...
the greatest car that you &apos;ve ever seen from &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the world &apos;s greatest drink , &quot; which you &apos;ve ever had , a attention of &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
so the idea is to show that brands are part of life , actually , to get them to fund the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of an extrovert .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to end .
and i would be happy if you could help it to make this happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how to be more inclusive people .
have you a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; vantage point , &quot; because that &apos;s a negative effect -- but you know how that &apos;s going to evolve ?
how much money is needed to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet you , but i think it &apos;s worth it on every case , some really familiar brands .
who knows if the film comes out , we may see a little bit of a little bit of a life .
what do you think the answer will be ?
the answer is very likely to be a very , very likely .
but is it a difficult thing to do because of the movie or a difficult thing to do with me ?
jk : both .
so -- so , not so optimistic .
so , my lord , you can help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think of what brands .
yeah .
if you look at the people who you have to do with it ...
there are some places that we can apply to .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera would be , &quot; that we wanted to lead a nuclear prize .
it turns out it meant , in fact , &quot; we want to do nothing with her film . &quot;
and just disappeared all these companies , one after the other .
not wanted to do something with the movie .
i was amazed .
they wanted to do absolutely nothing with the project .
and i was confused because i thought the whole concept that was the idea of advertising is to present your product as many people as possible as possible as many people can see .
especially in the world today , in this interface of new and old media and the fragmented media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting fashion , that the mass is bringing this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a mistake , and that was to be made .
actually no , that was not the mistake of all .
that would have no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is is a problem .
you see , if you &apos;re in the world &apos;s business , this is one of the first images that appears .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free from deception and the very democratic , just to detect and diagnose , and immediately , understandable , understandable , and that &apos;s the most important thing about the most -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re now hearing a whole lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says it even , even our ceos say it .
but if it comes to the way that it &apos;s going to be done , something is going to change .
but why ? well transparency is a scary -- like this strange bear , which still pissed out .
it &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of the morning -- like this strange highway .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is there ?
a whole bowl of cool food .
that &apos;s very risky .
so when i started talking to companies , and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid , and my father caught me in lying -- and he sits and looked at me with this -- would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions of every story .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film we wanted to tell the true version .
but there &apos;s only one company , an agency , to help us -- and that &apos;s just because i know john bond and richard &apos;s for years -- i found that i had to do it alone , i had to do it with the dead and the company
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start talking to these companies that understand how your brand is going to understand , a broad problem .
i have friends who make big , giant , giant , giant , and i have friends that make little bits of things like me .
and my friends , the big , giant , giant , giant , huge , why their movies are so successful , is that they have the same , which they have .
and then my friends , the little little bits of glass , are &quot; well , how do we deal with these big , gigantic , giant , giant , giant water ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the u.s. &apos;s atmosphere , &quot; the u.s.
so how exactly are we going to see a movie in the movie ?
whenever i go to the way , and whenever i open the way open , you &apos;ll see a lot of the time that you &apos;re going to see a lot of time .
and every time i do somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
they &apos;re so far ? they see a little nervous .
i want to help you to calm up .
so maybe you should be a little bit of this interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great approaches .
either &quot; the &quot; yo fusion &quot; or &quot; paradise &quot; you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped for men as well for women -- solid , or stick , whatever .
this is the most important thing .
now i can answer all of your questions and give you a more powerful version .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you talked about the smaller movies , we are as a brand a brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so , doing things like this -- you know , people remember the people &apos;s vocal budget -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
what words would you describe to a ban ?
watch is a tan .
this is a great question .
girl : technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that somebody &apos;s supposed to be in the elected .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that these categories really makes a difference in something that is important , unlike fighting odor and moisture . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three fresh , three times .
these things have more unequal effects .
and this is a very reactive .
what about me ? what about the most important thing ?
i have to talk to the man on the street that &apos;s like me , the way i do it .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like beautiful clothes .
&apos; 80s , in a row , he meets a lot of time , except at the bottom of the day .
well , what is the brand of the brand ?
unique .
i think the most important thing that i have , the style i have is &quot; the glamour glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , lots of plastic , and so on .
but normally , i have a computer designer , like ada , or a jewelry and so on .
if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classic iraqi shack .
the brand i &apos;m , i would say , would say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to go to the fly .
10 : part of a moron , part of al-qaeda , part of the mouth -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the most popular .
i sell the whole country around the world , around the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , depressing industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was a little bit of a time .
man 5 : brand the piano of the mountain .
is that ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a college maker .
i &apos;m tom .
now , we can &apos;t be all the most sophisticated , but i often see myself in the interface of the glamour glamour and the fly .
and what was noticed was that i needed a experts .
i needed somebody who could go into my head , somebody who could really help me understand what you call the &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so i found a company called olson &apos;s license in the prison .
they have companies like the rna , and they helped them discover these kinds of things .
if you could do it for doing it , you could help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me a little bit about how this is related to your thoughts and feelings about you .
these are the people who are my worldview .
tell me about this world .
so , the world is , this world , i think , the world is the world where you live -- how people around a round , the friends , the family , the way you live your life , the work and so .
all these things came and start from a place , and for me , and i started to start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s next about that you want to talk about .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is that to the thought and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
tell me about why , &quot; why do you get us ? &quot;
what is the most important thing ? what are you in ?
why is it important , what is the red thing ? what represents the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little more about you , that &apos;s not you .
what else do they have through ?
... that doesn &apos;t have to be afraid . what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
yup ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for the patience .
yeah . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen from that .
so , there was a lot of crazy things going on .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their favorite scores had two separate , but the pages of the pages -- the morgan &apos;s name is a little bit of a sudden / a writer .
so that &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies will only focus on a strength , rather than both .
many companies tend to -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re safe , they &apos;re afraid to avoid these elements , and that they &apos;re actually moving to a very positive , and they &apos;re actually moving into something
what other brands do they do ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , target , remote , little little little of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
now , there &apos;s a lot of brands and the brands , these things that come and go , but a more powerful , more powerful brand , is a pretty strong thing .
a more powerful , brand brand . how is your brand ?
if someone asked them to describe their favorite , their favorite , how would they be ?
they &apos;re a little bit of a design problem ? are they that blood brings up in the state of the sun ?
or are they more like a nuclear war ?
are you something that a little calm down , you know , more conservative , conservative ?
the things that are , the basics , are the basics , the way the most prolific , recyclable , ominous , failed and recyclable , and the same as the coal , agile and agile , and the way that they do .
or are they more like a nuclear war ?
are they mindful and more sophisticated like the rna ?
are they established , traditionally , more , more powerful , more compassionate , like oprah ?
are you reliable , stable , recyclable , safe , nirvana , you &apos;re , you know , holy , and wise , and the dalai lama ?
in the course of the movie , we had more than 500 companies , who were up and the other , and the &quot; no &quot; said because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this movie , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control on the finished product .
but , 17 , 17 years of being willing to get ready to get out of that control , who wanted to do with someone who wanted to do business so badly and convincing us , and the other thing that we can do is tell stories that we could
they &apos;re going to tell us that the story of the world &apos;s history , as we tell the story in this movie , is that you use the world today to be used for the brain , and to make the brain account , both of the time .
we went to sao paulo where we had been banned .
in the entire city , since five years , there &apos;s no poster , no poster , no sins , nothing .
and we drove in school school , where companies are moving their way into lonely schools , in all america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback , or where i had the largest success , those are where i directly interacted with things .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they were expected to be the middle of the world , and they were thinking that the banking agencies didn &apos;t really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate directly with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people think of , that our view is going to challenges .
and how did it be for you ? what do you succeed ?
now , because the film in the title festival festival had the first time we can look at this .
according to the first time , the first is in january , and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million of the people &apos;s worth of film .
that &apos;s actually a period of two weeks of a second .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film hasn &apos;t been coming up .
there &apos;s no time for him to be online . no , no .
it &apos;s not coming out of other countries .
now , finally , the film has a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every ad that we talked about , with the client that we &apos;ve been talking about , the fingers of it .
something i think is that if you give your chance to take risks , risks that you &apos;re putting risks in these risks .
i think if you keep people off , you &apos;ll get closer to failure .
i think that if you &apos;re doing your employees , you &apos;re going to be able to get risks , you &apos;re prepared to get a profit to get a profit .
i feel that we have to encourage people to take risks .
we have to encourage people not to have a fear of opportunities that you might be able to do .
finally , we should be able to be afraid of fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
they &apos;re welcome to fear . they welcome the risk .
and a big taste of a big taste , we &apos;re so hot .
and finally , we should be welcome to transparency .
today , more than ever before , we get a little bit of a bad bit of a lot of honesty .
and that , with honesty and transparency , my whole talk &quot; was called transparency &quot; -- it was introduced to me by my good friends of the computer , who paid $ skilled for the dollar for ebay .
big data is turned to organizations around the world in large opportunities .
and the name is , &quot; they &apos;re welcome to transparency . &quot;
thank you .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , what is the right thing to do with the $ day ?
this is a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , and i put the test on the front of the road , the most cosmopolitan of the kitchen , the city of a $ hour in the base of the day to fund my favorite year .
my name is a lot of the time .
18 months ago , i was doing something else at google , and i was doing something about the museums and art , and my favorite , which is now , i gave me the green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of the research of research and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and explaining your access .
i grew up in india .
i was a great education , a great education -- i didn &apos;t -- but i had a lot of museums and this artwork didn &apos;t have access .
when i went to visit , and these museums go to visit , i started learning a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried to do this desire -- art to make a lot of work together .
we then went to a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you &apos;re just going to go to the sound .
you can look around all these museums here .
there &apos;s the most important thing , moma , the ted , the most salient , the van gogh .
i even come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get on two because of it -- very simple .
and you know , the math , and it &apos;s in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you &apos;re walking around and you get to replicate .
you want to be in the museum ?
open the map , and jump with a click .
in fact , they &apos;re , they want to go to the end of the kidney gangs .
just further . a lot of fun .
it &apos;s printed .
thank you , but the best thing comes .
so i &apos;m a friend of mine , a hippie student in the met .
i see this grasshopper .
if the museum gave us the picture , it click on it .
now this is one of the images .
this is all the metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i click this now .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve held with the so-called so-called the so-called &quot; giant effect . &quot;
this picture for example has about 10 billion of the world &apos;s worth of time , i believe .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
now , i &apos;m going to show you this .
you can very easily put it in and you can get it in .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is criticized .
but then you really want to get deep inside .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there was something going on there .
and i thought , &quot; wait , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and i slowly noticed that these kids actually beat something .
i was doing a little bit about a little bit of a known lesson , and i found it actually found that it was a game called the &quot; play game &quot; in the front of a mat , who was beaten up with a mat on the floor .
it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really go close to the end , you can go to the end .
just to give you the point of view , i &apos;m out of the way you see what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best thing comes -- in a second .
let &apos;s jump quickly to moma , again in new york .
another more of me , more and more .
and the previous example of the previous one was to find detail .
but what if you want to see the brush ?
and what only if you want to see van gogh &apos;s masterpiece , because of this masterpiece , what &apos;s going to do ?
you &apos;re in it . you can really go in .
i &apos;m going to zoom into one of my favorite projects that i &apos;m going to zoom on in the most part of the room .
this is a little bit of a time , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there &apos;s many more , but i &apos;m missing time .
this is really cool part , it &apos;s called the collections .
everybody , every one -- whether rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go and create your own museum online -- from all these images you can put your own collection .
just simply , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of the design -- you can get more educated .
this is the most important , in the u.s. war .
you can have it all with grapes , and you &apos;re going to start sending your friends , and so you start to think about what you &apos;re feeling when you look at this masterpieces .
i think finally , for me , is the main thing that all the wonderful things don &apos;t come from google .
you don &apos;t think of my own museums .
i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was a experience in humility .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to be just with this digital medium of art , and they represent pretty online .
and the biggest question that i asked is , &quot; did you do this , do you do that to replicate the experience of a design ? &quot;
the answer to that is no .
it should be the experience .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can be divided in two halves .
this is the left half the way that it &apos;s the logical side and then half the rights that &apos;s the intuitive side .
if we had a measure of measuring the gas , every hemisphere could be able to measure their brain .
for example , this guy is completely logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you put your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have been in favor of one of these extremes , but i think , for most people in the audience , their brain looks like this -- with a high amount of energy that is at the same time in both hemispheres .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both embarrassed or something like that .
you can be logical and intuitive .
and so i see myself as one of the people , with most experimental intellectual imaging , who need a good fraction of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good fraction of intuition to actually do experiments .
how do we develop these intuition ? well , we love playing things .
so we go out and play it and look at how it &apos;s responding , and then we start developing our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that a thing can be just at the same time .
i mean , it can sound strange about thinking that a thing is at the same time at two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they developed them .
i remember a child playing on a computer program .
he was a toddler , and he was not very good at it , and he kept staying .
but i bet that playing with the design of a very valuable lesson , which is the great things you don &apos;t just leave , and that you &apos;re staying on a place .
and this is a great model of the world , so long they &apos;re not a nuclear model .
it would be a terrible model for a design system because they don &apos;t play with the most peculiar particles , but with these little weird particles .
and if you play with the particles , you &apos;re all found out of some kind of weird things -- like you fly directly through walls , or you can be at the same time at two different places .
and so they all wrote these observations , and they called them the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the one that was the physics of a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need them to describe the big common objects around us .
that &apos;s not what i liked , and maybe i just don &apos;t have to play with particles .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical side is not like that .
because if all of these particles are made and all these particles are the rules of quantum mechanics , then shouldn &apos;t it just be the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that should not be that way .
so i would feel better with the whole thing , if we could somehow show that everyday objects are also the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a few years ago , just to do this .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see in the most sophisticated fashion of the world .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green point there in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
here i get it out . we look at the center here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal , it &apos;s shaped like a magnifying , and it &apos;s about the edge .
so i made this thing on the same way that you make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new york , and i was going to talk about a new one of the big devices .
i had to build my own machine -- to build this kind of swimming pool , and get the thing to do .
this thing has the ability to be in the design of the world &apos;s body , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i &apos;ll make all kinds of weird things , but then other people go and i hear all these things , because i don &apos;t want to be concerned with them , or i don &apos;t want to be
so quantum mechanics says that the objects are just feeling the same thing .
the fellow fellow for the other objects are not just people , but also the light that seems to you and the wind that goes over to them and the heat of space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is acting , we had to get out of all the oil systems .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we turned off the lights , put it into a vacuum , and the whole air , and the air , and it &apos;s almost to the right , and it &apos;s almost to the end of the elevator , and it &apos;s the piece of metal , and it
so we measured his movement .
we found it really really moves it .
instead of all , it &apos;s just quiet , it &apos;s a way of doing it , the way it was about this -- like a little bit of the time , like this -- like a little bit of a sudden and together , and together , the most
we gave him a little push , we could put it to the same time , and not to decipher -- something just to be allowed to do in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what really fantastic .
what does it mean to vibrate for the same time and not mix up ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion atoms from the atoms are still there , and the same time is moving , and the same atoms move and down .
just to direct voices , they &apos;re matching .
the rest of time are the same .
that means that every atom is at the same time at two different places , which is the same thing that &apos;s all the metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
this is worth me for all this year in the clean room , because , you see , the most important thing between a single atom and this piece of metal is about as much as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if one atom can be at the same time at two different places , this piece of metal can be two different places , why not they &apos;re ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical effect is .
so , imagine you &apos;re at the same time at several places , how would this feel ?
how would you mind that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we were doing it , the light , the light , and the box , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece of there .
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator , actually , are just just just a kind of kind of thing that &apos;s in a small room , which is together in a small space .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s still deeper .
it &apos;s that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the profound and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we should be able to think of the way we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families think about where they live and they want to work , they give them the opportunity between at least one hand of different cities that all are in competition to be different people in competition .
now , we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries that don &apos;t even have a single city to be welcome to the name of them .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more worth than it costs to build .
so we could just be very simple with the world , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
now , this may sound absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
so , they &apos;re just sharing the building from apartments against the cities .
imagine half of the people who want to live in homes , they &apos;ve already done this ; the other half of them don &apos;t yet do .
they could try to expand the capacity of existing homes .
but you know what you &apos;re going to be going to be going to be in these homes and to keep the environment to be questionable and put on the ground .
so it turns out that as a very difficult thing , it &apos;s all coming out of this kind of mesh .
but you could go to a completely new place , a completely new block of machine , which is , in a way , to be a building , and not to be involved in it .
so i proposed that governments create new areas , which are enough to provide a city for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
i found that , about the same time , about the same time , the same time , and the challenge of reform , was in a paralyzing part of reform .
they knew that every year about 70,000 years every year , they were leaving their country to be able to get into the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the
at this point , the most powerful thing about the book is , &quot; what happens if we &apos;re putting a space of the land in the country , what if we just get a message to the american embassy , a part of the canadian world , and if
in 2009 , in 2009 , under a severe school accident .
the next election election , the election bureaucrats , won the scottish representatives in a superconductor whose program both was , and also , in the process , promised .
he asked him to become a professional student .
in the meantime , i was preparing to talk to tedglobal at tedglobal .
and through improvement , and by studying consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter city to basically reduce elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it .
we &apos;re paying a new attention , but for progress , it takes technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that are given us .
in the fall 2010 , a friend sent out of guatemala , the link to the tedtalk .
and again , it showed him a little bit .
the two would be called me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s give the head of our country to the country ! &quot;
so we met in december of a hotels in miami in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make a lot of valuable cities , how valuable cities are , as much more valuable they are .
and i used this chart to show how valuable it is to a place like new york , and think about that , a space in some cases is worth thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , and it was a very abstract discussion , and there was a pause , and he said , &quot; paul , could we look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk put in very simple form that a charter is a place that is beginning to start the land , which is a very , a key place that &apos;s going to define the laws that are going to be able to make and make the people the
so , i was asked by the president of 1946 , which meant that we have to do this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way that we &apos;re going to bring our country to the country .
i was asked to get to the world &apos;s office and even keep a talk in the fourth and fifth january a talk .
so i &apos;ve been giving a different talk of facts , which is a graph like this , which has tried to make that , that if you want to make a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch represents the new airport , which was built in denver .
alone , this airport has a surface of 100 more sophisticated .
so i &apos;ve tried to convince the world &apos;s most , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with a field of at least 1,000 .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand acres .
polite have all the most sophisticated .
the audience of the audience was very serious and carefully .
the leader of congress came on the stage , and he said , &quot; professor &apos;s favorite , i thank you for your talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the punch line that a new city provides the people new possibilities .
there would be the possibility in a city that would be in rochester , rather than hundreds of miles away from the north .
and a new city also includes new ways of executives with one .
the leaders of the government in 1908 were dependent on the help of the aid , and they could benefit from their favorite , which they would build at the laws of the charter , and they would support the laws that could really get taken out of it .
and the discovery of president cilliers , was that the confidence of the amount of money i thought was about to get the foreign investors to make the foreign investors and build this city for all the parties in accra who have been afraid of fear and mistrust .
we &apos;re in a field .
this picture is from this place .
it just expresses a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly after , the 19th , june , they voted at the future of the constitution for a change to have a more powerful policy that &apos;s been approved for special amounts of control .
in a country that has just been a decent crisis behind the ground , congress was elected for this kind of thing with velcro .
all parties , all the time of society , supported this .
and to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved by congress .
at the 17th of february , it was approved for a big deal to a voice .
immediately after that election , between the 21st and 24 february , an delegation of about 30 percent of the world , the two places in the world , were interested in the most part of the world , which was most interested in the business of the design .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new city , built in south korea , and that &apos;s the big deal of the city in the world airport .
all you can see on this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the ensemble .
the other place that was very interested in the urbanism is singapore .
it &apos;s been built in china already , and the third is in preparation .
so if you think about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a video of a second ; they &apos;re looking at this area for the second city .
it &apos;s been done on a legal system that the fact that it &apos;s allowed to be able to participate and work on an external legal system .
a country already offered his top court to put on the world &apos;s top , as a dish for the internet &apos;s name .
also , the same thing and the most interesting thing is , very interested .
they even get funding with one .
one thing you already know was true , there &apos;s a lot of the math types .
there are many businesses that like to put in america , especially in a place with a free free market , and there are many people who would like to live there .
on the whole world , there are 700 million people who say they want to live in a different place .
a million people are leaving latin america every year and go into the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to leave their families to work on their families to be able to work on the side of their own , and to make their clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s even kids who try to find their parents to find their parents that they &apos;ve seen , in some cases , since a decade .
so what is it for an idea to think about this in 1908 , a completely new city ?
or even , in fact , to build these cities , or hundreds of them around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to be that every family has a choice between several cities that are in competition to stand new residents ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends from 1946 asked me to say , thank you ted .
you know how many decisions you do in a typical day ?
you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve been doing a survey about 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that makes the most common american is a typical american one day .
and also , recently , a study was done with ceos that they saw for a week the ceo .
and these scientists just documented the different themes with whom they were doing , and how much time they were doing it , and they spent how much time they were doing with the issues .
and they found that a average ceo is busy doing a lot of work in the week with a little bit of work .
each of these topics were from many , many of the small people .
50 percent of their decisions were hit within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions needed one hour or more of their time .
think of your own decisions .
you know how many decisions you meet in the nine minutes of a category in the nine minutes ?
how good do you think they &apos;re going to cope with the decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the largest most popular of our modern time , the most important thing .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , you get , because i &apos;m blind , just if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , i ask you if i ask you a question , and your answer is , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear something about the most important ?
thank you .
when i was a college student at stanford , i went to this very , very impressed store , at least at the time he was really embarrassed .
it was a store that was called the &quot; s . &quot;
this business , it was almost like a computer company .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and oil and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was a time when we actually drink the other day .
i loved to go to this business ; but at a point , i asked myself , well , how does it come to you , you never buy anything ?
here &apos;s the olive oil .
they had over 75 different kinds of oil , including that in boxes that were used by thousands of years old .
so i decided to go to the transplant race , and i asked the head , &quot; works this model , &quot; that they really do this model , that they really offer people all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up the radio of tourists , which came up every day and usually had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment and we chose to do the experiment for our experiment .
here &apos;s your favorite gang .
they had a different species of plastic types .
we &apos;ve set up a little bit of a little bit of the nest right on the entrance .
we put six different tastes there , or 24 different tastes , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i think what would be more people , and are we trying to do it , one , i would have more people who are going to stay
it &apos;s been more people when it was 24 percent , about 60 percent , when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what the people were going to buy a glass of glass .
now we saw the opposite effect .
and the people who were standing in the face of 24 were only three percent actually , actually , bought a glass of glass .
from the people who were standing as it were six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of glass .
now , if you calculate it , people were buying six times a glass of glass , who they had six to choice when they had 24 to choice .
now , to decide not to buy glass of glass , probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the most powerful thing is that we &apos;re affecting the decisions in very highly difficult decisions .
we don &apos;t choose to decide , even though it comes against our own best interests .
so the theme of the day is saving financial resources .
i &apos;m going to describe to you now a study that i &apos;m using with a little bit of the time , and i &apos;m making it , the most powerful , the design of the brain , which we &apos;ve made to make decisions for retirement from almost a
and what we looked at was whether the number of the most sophisticated , which was possible to be a camel &apos;s plan , who was going to be fooled by the chance of life .
and we found that there was actually a relationship in the fact .
so in these plans , we had about the same plans that people had something between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more educated were offered that , in fact , participation was less likely to be less likely .
now if you look at the extreme , the plans that have two fund offered , had a plastic company in the 1970s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that almost 60 fund offered , the most prolific controlled was now about the u.s. government .
now , it turns out that even if you &apos;re going to participate , if more options were to choice , even it &apos;s got negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate in the way that the more possibilities were available to you , the more they were being avoided and fulfilling .
the more possibilities they were available to them , the more they put their entire money in pure water .
none of these extremes , you know , are listening to the decisions that someone would recommend when we &apos;re important to the future financial well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential negative consequences that offer that of more and more choices with themselves .
they push the decision -- push them , even if it &apos;s going to be interested in their own best interest .
they &apos;re more likely to make worse decisions -- worse money and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re going to decide more to things that they &apos;re less satisfied to themselves , even if they make it objective better .
the main reason that we might enjoy that , we might enjoy these huge dives full of light , mustard , oil and plastic , but we can &apos;t actually compare the comparison and then actually choose something from the fantastic offer .
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested on different kinds and different kinds of technologies -- that you can just use in your business .
first , just just .
they &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today , that less is more .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; just let me go . &quot;
they always make sure they lose their attention .
but in fact , we see more and more , and that if you &apos;re ready to be willing , and the more irrelevant possibilities are going to be going to be , well , there &apos;s a rising increase , it &apos;s going to get a rising rise of
as a designer , and gamble , the different head of head and the other head of 26 , they experienced a rise of transport to the $ 10 , they had a rise of transport to 10 percent .
when the golden corporation of the corporation were selling their 10 at worst , they had been experiencing that the profits were growing by a tenth of the rise of the rise of the rise and the reduction of cost .
you know , the average average system today , gives you 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart is giving you 100,000 products today .
but the most salient supermarket , the world &apos;s supermarket , is the world &apos;s supermarket , and they &apos;re just offering to give you 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in a wheelchair .
now in the world of the world , i think one of the best examples that recently came to the market , about how to best the choice , was something that david &apos;s most powerful has been doing , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s going to be offered
every single harvard harvard is going to take employees down to a piece of time .
and they want to be a choice of that , they &apos;re offered 20 fund , not 300 or more educated .
you know , as people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to take it away .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if their employees don &apos;t get them to the head , they can &apos;t do their clients . &quot;
now , before we started tonight , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to spend all the people in this audience a little bit of a street on the most beautiful road of the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read you the reading .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a few seconds to read them and then i ask them to clap , if you &apos;re willing to take gary &apos;s offer .
okay . everybody &apos;s willing to take gary &apos;s offer .
are that all ?
well , let me show you something more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who is ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve probably heard more hands .
good .
the fact that they looked at is an objective , the first time , had more information than the second time , but i would be a big driver to guess that they were the second time .
because the pictures had made it feel real .
what brings me to the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of the design of the world &apos;s problem , is the most important thing .
it &apos;s about that people , to understand the difference between the possibility of the possibility , to understand what the consequences are associated with the individual possibilities and that &apos;s what you have to feel like .
why are people spending about 15 to 30 percent more if they use a card card or a card card when there &apos;s a card card ?
because it doesn &apos;t feel real money .
and it turns out that if you make it , something feels specific , it &apos;s a very good tool to make people save more .
so we have a study that i did with a computer chip , and we did limor &apos;s research , we &apos;ve done a study with people who have been working on the ground -- employees that have been working for all of the people who have been working on
and as this meeting , we &apos;re going to leave this meeting just like you always have , just a little bit .
the little thing that we added to , was that we asked people to think about all the positive things that would happen in their lives , if they were saving money .
in the fact that we did this simple thing , there was a procedure of participation to give 20 percent and there was a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or a rise to the four percent that they were willing to pay for .
third technology : the second thing .
we can do better with more categories than with more choices .
so , for example , here &apos;s a study that we &apos;ve done in a field of a field .
it turns out that in the coastal industry , and below the northeast of the northeast , the number between the range of magazines , the number between the stone magazines , has been up to the top of the magazines .
but do you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines , and you put it in 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 magazines , and that in 20 categories , you think i gave you more choices , and you have a better job of research than i gave you the
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different types of water .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; jazz . &quot;
if you think that the left display is the left , and the ad on the right is jazz , then they clap into the hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that the left side of jazz is and the ones that are on the right is , you clap them up , please clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the left is jazz and the right on the right is , but you know what ?
this is a very high carbon system .
the categories have to say something , not the choice of the selection .
and this problem often looks at you when you look at the long lists of all these things .
who is you going to be talking about that ?
my fourth technology : assumption for complexity .
it turns out that we can actually deal with more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we need to slow the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s a german inversion , which gives you the opportunity to make your car completely .
you have to make 62 different decisions to design your car completely .
now these decisions are different in the number of choices that they offer a decision .
so , the car , the car , the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
now what i do is i change the order of the decisions that make decisions .
half of the customers is going to be from the many possibilities , 56 , to the most likely possibilities , four gears .
the other half of the customers is about the most important possibilities , four gears , to the 56 million , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
how do they care about it ?
if you &apos;re constantly using the most important thing to the decision , that means that you &apos;re being overwhelmed , i &apos;m losing it .
what you &apos;re finding is that people who go from the many to the most low , are always going to pick up the most important thing .
we lose them .
go from the little choices to the many , then you stay in the process .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is change the order of this information .
if i start with the simple start , i &apos;m learning how to go .
even though the gears choose to pick me up , nothing about my preferences in the interior , it &apos;s still making me look at it .
it also puts me into excitement about the big product that i &apos;m going to do , and so i &apos;m ready to get to be interested in being interested in it .
let me summarize .
i &apos;ve told you about four techniques that address the problem of the design -- just -- you &apos;re going to be the surplus alternatives ; you &apos;re going to get the surplus -- we can get better -- we can get better with more categories , less possibilities .
each of these techniques that i &apos;m going to describe to you today is to help you manage the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people who offer service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re concerned about choice .
and the more we choose to select , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin atwood , who &apos;s a lot of youtube , and i &apos;m looking at youtube videos .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are spread , and then why it &apos;s important .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singers , comedians -- when i was young , it seemed so infinitely difficult .
but the other thing is , we have enabled that we can all be very famous with all of our creative activities in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to the next saturday .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours of video is uploaded to a minute .
and again , one tiny percentage of the only percentage of it is just just spread and it &apos;s going to look like thousands of times and so on .
so how does that work ?
three things : &quot; oops , &quot; and the unexpected , and the unexpected .
well , then we want to do .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
whoa !
mountain design , ow !
last year , the video of the video would wake up the video that he filmed in the english park .
in 2010 , it was been looked at 23 million times .
this chart shows how it looked at the first time the video was popular for the first time .
actually , the electric video didn &apos;t want to do a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing this , if you &apos;re talking to the mountain mountain , you &apos;re going to be infected .
he got a lot uploaded to a lot of the design .
and this video was actually sent in january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jimmy atwood .
jimmy libeskind kamen would send the tweet , the video of the video that was popular .
because the way jimmy atwood are asking us new and interesting things , and show them a big audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday . double get down on friday . there &apos;s a little bit of the time to the train , and it &apos;s the most slow to the ted , and you &apos;ve never thought that we have that conversation , and you don &apos;t think
rebecca , &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
it was almost 200 million times a year ago .
this is what the graphics looked like .
just like &quot; double &quot; in the &quot; double &quot; it seems to be nothing .
what happened to this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also more sinister .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , the most important thing about the computer , a lot of blogs started writing about it .
michael j. nelson &apos;s science of science was a first , which was a joke with twitter .
and it &apos;s important that one individual or group of the group of the group took a point of view , divided with a big audience and accelerated the process .
then this community of people , they formed these big joke , and they started talking about it and to talk about it .
now there are 10,000 years of &quot; friday &quot; at youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a spoof for every single day .
unlike the most successful conversation of the 20th century , the participation of the community is to become part of this phenomenon -- either we &apos;re spreading it or something new from it .
&quot; the &quot; s &quot; is animation and music in the jungle .
it &apos;s , very simple .
this year , it was looked at almost 50 million times .
and if you think that for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a more powerful thing that has been looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats who look at this video .
it &apos;s important , the creativity that is in the most sophisticated and exotic .
there were spines .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole of the entire design of the soil that made it a kind of stupid joke to something that we can all participate in .
now we &apos;re not just finding pleasure at something , we &apos;re doing with it .
who could have all this to be fooled ?
who could have been able to predict &quot; double &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; rebecca black or &quot; rebecca ? &quot;
what could you do to write in the same way that you could do that ?
in a world where every minute , two days , there &apos;s just a really unique and unexpected thing that &apos;s written in the world , and it &apos;s a really unique thing to talk about .
i &apos;m not going to be a very interested in my mind when i was a friend , i should look at this great video , about a guy who &apos;s in new york against traffic shops .
i got a ticket because i &apos;m not on the edge of the road , but often there are disabilities that don &apos;t leave you at the very top of the road .
and that &apos;s where it was quite surprising and humorous , was a casey &apos;s funny idea , and his argument was looking at five million times .
this approach is true for everything we do creative .
and that &apos;s all that leads us to a big question .
what does that mean ?
so .
what does that mean ?
and the other thing that is , creative , creative , is completely unexpected , is the features of a new way of media and culture to anyone and the audience that is very popular in the audience .
as i said , one of the most important stars -- justin bieber -- did his start on youtube .
nobody needs to give the green light .
and today we all feel as a owners of our culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media and they &apos;re not going to make them on the media today , but they &apos;re going to be able to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the connectedness between women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of these connectedness are in a four year-old girl , when they were in front of a dozen years ago , and they had been sitting in a little boat , and
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still composed .
i want to tell you about some of the most exciting .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life &apos;s life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life of the simple hope of unity and freedom has been held in .
and if you were to get it in the test of the respected study in the world &apos;s office , as he has to admit , his life had been a single waste .
the words , so long , his friends , are now his friends .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never forgot to be his life .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the story was really trying to crush us , but we went through it .
the next piece of puzzle shows how a boat in the early south zealand is silent .
my mother may be 18 , when her father died -- in a front marriage before , with two little girls .
for them , life was asked to be a task : the escape of their family and a new life in australia .
it was completely excluded that they could fail .
after a four , and a canadian monk , a boat , a boat , is still poisoning the sea as a car .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear had they had famine , rape and death .
as most adults on the boat wore my mother a little bit of a little bit of a sudden .
in a sense of a design program , my sister and i would have to drink , and my grandmother &apos;s hand .
my first memories are from this boat -- the steady of the engine , the clapping of any wave on the front , the vast and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came up with many times , but from the most important of the men on our boat , or on the front of the engine , the six hours of the boat , not going to start the six hours .
but i remember the lights of the world &apos;s lights on the coast of the coast , and at the young man , the collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and on the taste of the first , the first one
no apple ever tasted again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next thing is , by four women , in three generations , in three generations , that are a new life .
we let ourselves go down to the middle of a world , from the middle of the world &apos;s world &apos;s population , which is the population of the world .
unlike the most unknown of the brain , their existence was completely unknown , there was no more painful in the prison .
the smell of the world &apos;s favorite , came from the rest of the world .
and the most broken broken legs were made between people , which had one thing together : they started new .
my mother worked on farms , and then on a line of a line in a museum , six days , twice layers .
it was kind of a time to find the time , to get english and the rescue .
we were poor .
every dollar was given , and was put in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we had to do for it . most of the time we had the new stuff that came from second hand .
two of the indian school for school , every one , to cover the holes in the other .
a more delicious one , because they had to be six years .
and there were the rare ones , but there were the rare ones , and there and there &apos;s a lot of the plastics , and there &apos;s a lot of the plastics .
after home where ?
something more important in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and quiet voice , &quot; i &apos;m going to go from the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other from our day , and we heard the movement of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered from the boat .
and it was my job , every night to stay awake , until her nightmares came to me so i could wake them up .
she opened a computer center , and then a little bit of a business , and then a business was going to put .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t have the change , angry and more , and they were caught children , and they caught up with two worlds .
loans and sponsors were searching .
centers were built .
i lived in a hospital .
in one , i was the classic of the classic of the south american student , which was introduced to himself .
in the other , i was involved in insecure life , the tragic scars of violence , the most attractive scars and the wearable .
but so many were got to help over the years .
and because of this help , i was in my last year of the most famous year of the year of the year of the year .
and i was denied from a computer bank to the next to the next , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous , senior , was now tan , now , a tan and social activist , who was invited to talk to places that they never heard , and in homes , their existence never could have imagined .
i didn &apos;t know the main idea .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the most sophisticated thing .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the comfort of life of an unknown project -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters who were like , for every day , in their days , and they were telling each other , three times the same bed
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old now , as you went back to the boat , when we climb the boat .
no , no one had been a way .
&quot; just do it , &quot; she said . &quot; and it &apos;s not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about the news of the world and education , and the diagnosis of the world &apos;s favorite and the rescue .
and the more open i talked , the more i should tell .
i met people in all the business , so many of them did what they loved , lived on the borders of the possible possible .
and although i had my degree , i realized i couldn &apos;t be able to be able to be in law .
it had to be another kind of a different design .
and i realized the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a technologist , a design company , new zealand , new , but not just okay , but something you must be grateful , maybe a gift of the design of the world .
because the way it &apos;s going to collapse so easily is to collapse so easily , so easily you can be accepted to the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;m now enough from my favorite , to know that , yes , the world , but not as you can do it .
and opportunities that didn &apos;t have allowed to be really encouraged .
there was a energy , a continual optimism , a strange compassionate reality , and the more of the humility .
so i followed my gut gut .
i collected a little team of people to go to the test , &quot; not &quot; a &quot; a &quot; a &quot; and &quot; a &quot; of a challenge .
for a year , we didn &apos;t have a cent .
at the end of every day , i cook a huge truck of soup , which we shared .
we worked down to the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant ones , and we managed to do the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull in the united states .
just one journey there .
my gut gut again .
three months later , i moved and the adventure went on .
before i leave the lecture , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time where the social norm and local people were the most important person , and the most important person was the most important person .
life has not changed since centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother moved her alone .
with 17 , she was the second woman of a father whose mother suggested .
without the aid of your husband , she worried about a big deal by taking him in the court and she was in her own case , and a bigger deal , when she won .
&quot; not &quot; was an avid . &quot;
i just invite in a hotel room in sydney when she died . 1,000 kilometers away in melbourne .
i looked through the computer and saw it on the other side .
i knew they came to say to go to the answer .
my mother asked me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in a buddhist temple , sat around her sealed .
we told her stories and illiterate people , we were still in her .
and at midnight , the monk came and said he had to close the bathtub .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of your life is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because they &apos;ve been holding them tomorrow , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t left them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s going to be through the women .
you see , who we were and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would be given us to the resemblance .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i think of the boat .
who would ever wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , and i &apos;m afraid , before you get away .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous of everybody , ian , the most appropriate wave of the engine , the most horizon , the vast horizon that doesn &apos;t agree ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this to you and you might be safe to do it , i would do it .
and also , the mother &apos;s mother is here in the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it in the case of photography ?
because this is a picture that you can &apos;t take with his camera .
but i started my interest in photography when i got my first digital camera , at age 15 .
i put it with my former predilection for drawing , but it was a little different , because using the camera , the camera was actually in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you squeeze on the trigger .
so for me , it seemed to me that photography was more about being at the right time .
i thought everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that begins when the trigger is going to keep driving .
photos like this : a construction site along a much more sophisticated road .
but it has a kind of unexpected twist .
and yet , a realistic level .
or photographs like this -- dark and the same , but all with the common goal , a realistic level .
if i say reality , i &apos;m going to be a little bit more .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but i want to look at it as if you could have done that , on a photograph .
photos where you have to think of a brief moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea , as really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how they can be made on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what is realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality , where you can take different pieces and put together a different reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfectly concentrated objects , which we can identify all of us in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , it can actually produce something that looks still more three-dimensional than if there might be some more dimensions .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
so we weigh our brains , because our brain is very simple , not really , really makes sense .
and i see the same process in combine the pictures .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that look realistic is that i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things that we don &apos;t think about in our lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because it &apos;s just kind of wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow , to get a realistic outcome .
as you can see , this is not three special images .
but it can make something special about this .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
secondly , together , photographs should have taken the same water .
and these two images are going to fulfill these two needs -- from the same altitude , and the same as the same as the same .
third , it &apos;s about making it impossible to make it possible where the individual images begin and end them by connecting them into it .
it &apos;s impossible to say , how the picture was actually composed .
so by putting color , contrast and contrast to the edges of the individual images , photographic pencils , like the sound of color , the color of colors and disorders , we have the limits between the various images , and it &apos;s a single picture , although a
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that &apos;s just a landscape , and it &apos;s been manipulated by the bottom part .
but this picture is actually completely composed , and it &apos;s actually composed of photographs of different places .
i personally personally think that it &apos;s easier to create a place , as a place , because you don &apos;t have to take a compromise with the ideas in his head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed several months to try to figure out the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been taken on a giant island .
the bank is from a different place .
the main model is from a quarry .
and yes , i even have the house up on the island of red , to let it look like chad &apos;s .
so to get a realistic outcome , it &apos;s going to be a bit of me on planning .
i always start with a act , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s a very good job .
and then if you do good news , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also pretty realistic .
so , it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that is limited is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic mechanisms of failure .
and i think the most important thing about this is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we &apos;ve introduced to the most popular was to take a laser farm .
and you &apos;re not particularly scientific -- you &apos;re a cup of coffee or tea , and the patient , and the patients , families , are the relatives , the relatives , &quot; how do it go ? &quot;
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all of us -- maybe most of the electronic people have failed , because we stopped listening .
this is my favorite story . a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button on the / .
and every morning i jump on it .
and yes , i have a job , as you might recognize .
i have my job in 95 pounds .
it &apos;s just just like , every time i jump on the scale , you send my data to google health .
and there you &apos;ll also be in the same , of my favorite aunt , so he can see where my favorite card is , and it &apos;s not just the moment i &apos;m going to support , or not just in the moment i &apos;m going to take a
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you know , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 years of twitter on twitter .
so every morning i jump on my kitchen and people talk to me before i sit in the car , &quot; for lunch just a little bit of life today , &quot; for lunch . &quot;
but this is the most important thing that can happen because this is the blood pressure , pressure , to help patients , because it could be used against obesity , or it could be patients to smoke .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and they &apos;re putting them together in some kind of game to play their health better .
next week , this is coming on the market .
it &apos;s going to give you this little bit of a little bit of the puzzle that you &apos;re typing on a iphone or something .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure , send it to their physician and share it with other people , for something more than 100 dollars .
in this point , patients come to play . they can &apos;t only take control of the control , captain on their own ship , but can also help us with the challenges that are in front of us , and the health care of health , etc .
do the ways that they &apos;re using easy to use and start embracing them with these , patients in the team .
and that &apos;s what you can do through these methods , but also through all of them .
and one of the things we &apos;ve done , i want to share with you with a quick video .
we all have the most violent in our cars .
maybe in our mobile phones .
we know exactly where all the machines around the world are around the road .
we know one where all stations are .
and sure , we can find a lot of things .
but where would the next ted system to help this patient ?
we have a lot of time , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next life-saving bone was to find out in this moment .
so what did we do ? we &apos;ve been doing it in the netherlands .
we built a website and asked a crowd , &quot; if you see a little bit of a sudden , please share with us where he &apos;s , when he &apos;s in the , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed , of course , it &apos;s closed .
and over 10,000 years of life , already in the netherlands .
the next step was to find apps for it .
and we created a design map .
we &apos;ve developed an app for the design of the treatment , extended reality to find these kinds of things .
and if you &apos;re in a city like a city , and someone is collapsing , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks you also have your own , to find the next little , which is saving life .
and then we don &apos;t just want to just do this as a human being , as the product calls itself , but also to make it happen as a function of disease .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues all over the world , from other universities , to help us to help ourselves behave like the design of the world , to give up these kinds of things around the world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation , and someone is going to be your own commitment or somebody else , you can find a little bit of a life .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies are helping us to help us address this kind of thing that we &apos;re communicating .
these could be the kind of high-tech , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the most powerful thing is still in his place .
please help us and try and make it not just better , but to take the hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the business of the world .
and my little little bit of the time that we want to make ourselves make the environment , by doing ...
... it &apos;s a little bit of attention to the amur .
here &apos;s a short video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take it to it .
now -- we can just skip this -- i &apos;ll just throw the video ...
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
it &apos;s ...
oh , my time is already over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year and work in a environment that is so pretty much , which is what they hate , we &apos;ve been working in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the most important for geeks .
we choose some fellows every year , and we &apos;re going to work with it with a little bit of work .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them into the back of the world .
and they developed great apps , working with urban collaborators .
but what you really do is to show what &apos;s possible today .
so they meet al .
al is a computer in the city of boston .
here it is , as if he looks for a date , but what he really looks like is someone who &apos;s going to be a little bit of it , because he &apos;s white , because he &apos;s white , he &apos;s not very good at the most good
how did he come to look at this particular kind of help ?
we had a team last year of fellows in boston , which is &quot; code for america . &quot;
they were in february , and it &apos;s been much more sinister .
and they realized that the city never included these fire fires .
but a particular fellow , a man named erik atwood , noticed something else , and that was that the residents were making the sidewalks open , right from these parts .
so he did what everybody would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app , where you can adopt a fire fire .
you &apos;re going to fill it up to the lift , if it &apos;s a meal .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game game .
this is a modest small app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that fellows have written in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other species .
it &apos;s rapidly spreading .
there &apos;s this guy in the city department of town , which has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but , to adopt the citizens , to adopt the citizens .
it &apos;s very important that these are the things that work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then , in seattle , seattle decided to use the app to get the citizens to get the sewage oil .
and chicago just introduced it to the people who are the most cosmopolitan , when it &apos;s a meal .
we know nine cities now that plan to use this app .
and it &apos;s been more prevalent , organic , of course .
if you know something about the news , you know that it doesn &apos;t usually work .
the supply of software takes a few years to get a couple of years .
we had a team that was working last year on a project in boston , for three people , and they needed two months .
it was about a method that the parents can find out of the right public schools for their children .
we had been told later that if it was going to go over the normal channels , it took over two years and it took over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not even anything .
there &apos;s a project at the time that the global justice council is the most likely to cost the taxpayer , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spreading from the front of the road , a kind of shot on the institution of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- not more like a personal company , like a lot of people think that they should .
and not even like a nuclear scientist , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , this app is that they represent a new generation that the problem of government argued -- not as the problem of a corporate institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at the collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to fit together things effectively .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; there &apos;s hundreds of people all over the country who are up and writing , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re dreadful , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they &apos;re not complain about it .
and these guys know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all have your feelings about politics and the snake , and all the other things that we &apos;re really upset with , is that we really really upset ourselves , is government , in the core of tim o o &apos;clock , &quot; what we
now , a lot of people have given government to the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i ask you that you &apos;re going to be able to do it , because things change .
the politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government finally put their power out of us -- the people , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know much about government , when i started this program .
and as many people , i thought it &apos;s mainly about deciding people in office .
now after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s especially in community , to go to the world .
this is the call for service and information .
you &apos;re usually coming out of your town when you &apos;re in the city .
if you &apos;ve ever got the chance to work in your urban society , how our fellow scott scott &apos;s dream -- in fact , they do all -- you &apos;re going to see that all of the people who are calling the government , they &apos;re going to be
so scott gets this kind of thing .
he &apos;s typing &quot; the official database &quot; in the official database .
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the most powerful .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock is going to be more ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the world &apos;s end .
it &apos;s not just a call .
it has an app , a computer , and a computer simulation , called &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; .
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work that &apos;s very smart people in the office of the new urban management system in boston .
one day -- this is a actual report -- this is what came out : &quot; aw in my trash station . can &apos;t say if you &apos;re dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; is happening .
scott was struck by human beings .
but on &quot; the &quot; road &quot; is all public , so everyone can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next point we got was , &quot; i went over there , found the trash behind the house .
huh ? yes . alive . it &apos;s alive .
it turned out the trash . went home .
good night , sweet , sweet . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . this is the digital that &apos;s the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is to be placed in the process .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i &apos;m not necessarily talking about a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m more talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government played a central role .
they connected these two people .
and you could have put them with government performance , if that needs to be , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if a neighbor is helping the other , we create our communities .
let &apos;s call the most powerful , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is we need to think about it , that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they think that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is to vote .
how many people have voted a political leader -- and sometimes we &apos;ve used a lot of energy to choose a new political leaders -- and then we &apos;re going to keep ourselves back and we &apos;re expecting to reflect the government , and then not much ?
this is because the government is like a further ocean and politics is the top of the top .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with such contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we have , and we pay for that , and we &apos;re paying for something that &apos;s going to work against us , something else , and then we &apos;re ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we have to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real world &apos;s is happening .
we need to be able to get the machinery of government .
so the most important thing is , it did .
you saw these guys ?
it &apos;s a group concerned about a group of concerned that wrote a very detailed report , which is a response to the most prolific about the design of the world &apos;s atmosphere .
this is not political being active , that &apos;s an active thing .
now , for those of us who have given government to the government is time we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to introduce the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
do we really believe that what we need to do , we have to do without improving the institution that &apos;s in the name of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology is able to make it fundamentally relevant to the government of the government in a way that actually can achieve something by which they actually overcome society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the internet , and the white internet is that it &apos;s not so hard to do things in common , you have to build the only systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up with her voice as granted .
they don &apos;t fight this battle we all fight , about who can speak to , they &apos;re all allowed to talk .
you can make your mind , on every channel of time , and you do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that are improving the government of the government .
and these apps are going to make us using our hands to improve our communities .
it could be a fire fire , nephews to dig out a trash block with a plastic drill .
and sure , we would have these fire fires all the time , and many people do it .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers who are paying attention and they &apos;re hearing the taxes .
we &apos;re more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all got to do here is : if it &apos;s about the big , important things we need to do together , all of us are going to be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually , my role is to explain how wonderful the new technologies are , which are the emergence , and i thought , i &apos;m here , i &apos;m going to tell you what i &apos;m really thinking about , and i &apos;m going to tell you what i &apos;m
i &apos;m going to start to show you a single one , boring slide .
... you could just show the slide .
this is a slide that i picked out from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but rather about the universal form .
this slide shows data of a analysis of the performance of the power of the information of the brain , compared to the performance of a brain network networks .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , as many other people we find , are a kind of a way of finding in our field , a kind of a way of doing it .
in other words , every step here is a power in the most sophisticated .
and this is a novelty that we need to use this guy to be on the ground of the technology in the technology of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the lights back .
something more delicious because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper right now .
now , why do we draw graphs in technology in the technology of the brain ?
the reason for that is when i draw it on a normal curve , where , we say , this is the years , so the timeline of a kind , and this is a variety of examples of the technology that i want to show you with a graph
so , look at this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to record another technology , we &apos;ll say a little bit of a time , then that would come up with the most irrational scale , in form of a flat line .
but if this happens , it &apos;s going to change the way that it &apos;s going to be the circumstances .
so if the most fast thing is , as fast as the most powerful progression , then we could get more educated in a taxi and we would be in the 30 seconds .
but that &apos;s not that fast .
there was never before in history before the history of the world &apos;s history , that kind of kind of carbon growth , which is increasing exponentially , and that &apos;s increasing by the scale of the brain .
the question i want to ask you is if you look at this exponential curves , you &apos;re not going to go to it forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is going to expand forever and forever as fast as it is .
there are two options .
either it &apos;s going to be a classic classic , like here , to something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
this is about it .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think this is what happens in the way here .
so , it &apos;s really like that , it means we &apos;re right now in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re on this line , in a transition of the world , to a new way of the world .
so the question i want to ask , and i also often think of myself , is how this new world will be probably ?
what is this new condition that &apos;s going to take the world slowly ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing , if you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was a little bit of the future in 2000 , and people were often talking about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
and we &apos;re not going to go on that .
so in other words , the future has shrunk to every year , since i &apos;m on this world .
i think the reason is that we &apos;re going to realize that anything is happening .
the transition is happening . we can feel it all .
and we know that right now , there &apos;s no sense to try to see 30 or 50 years in the future because everything is going to be so different that a simple block of what we &apos;re doing now is not a sense of what we &apos;re doing now
now i want to talk about what this might be , this transition in which we currently are .
so to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really don &apos;t have technology or computers .
because i think to really understand this , we need to go back to a step and look at the thing on a longer and a longer complaint .
and i want to look at this on the podium of life in the world .
i think the big picture makes sense when you divide it into some of the pieces of time .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s 2.5 billion years . the earth was a big , big , scalable , with lots of chemicals .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , we have a pretty good picture about how they do the most important thing .
i think there are theories that start to understand how everything has started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of a little bit of a short story of what &apos;s going on , that this time , that &apos;s little oil pumps ,
some of these oil spills brought a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from outside to the outside and grow .
all the way , they began to triple .
these little oil oil systems were the most primitive of the most primitive .
but these oil oil oil oil seals weren &apos;t living in the sense of life , because every single one of them was just a little bit , casual recipe of chemicals .
and every time it shared , the chemicals have spread into the chemicals that are more diverse .
so every chip was a little different .
in fact , the scar , which had a growth of growth , had faster than others and integrated more chemicals and more chemicals from outside and divided themselves faster .
so this is what we &apos;re doing , more than survive , and it &apos;s multiplied in the equivalent of the extent .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , if this scar was a trick on abstraction .
in any way we don &apos;t really understand that , this scar is the ability to be learned information , information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and in a certain chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they found a way to find a way to find a way to be able to get them to the things that they were allowed to be , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is going to be about the time of the two billion years , where they came in , the same thing was stayed .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same notation .
and each living thing is that every living thing that &apos;s exactly the same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re so far that we can only write , just to the most , to the same thing , in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 of the main projects here , which i &apos;m trying to keep on the airports from the street of the world .
in this , what i &apos;ve done is -- what i &apos;ve done is i took this code -- the code is made from normal letters that we use to talk -- and i &apos;ve written my business card on a piece of dna and have it worth 10 ^
so if someone wants to give a hundred copies of my business card , i have enough for everyone in this room and even for everyone on this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i had a real , i &apos;d have a design set , and then i would have written it on a virus , and put it in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna of dna was an interesting step .
and the most important thing that these cells -- they made it happy for another billion years .
but then another one , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and that was , they started communicating these cells and exchange information , so communities came together by cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
this is also why the consistency is growing up to antibiotics .
some bacteria have found how they can stay away from penicillin and have this information together with other bacteria in the dna , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate .
now this communication allowed the reasons to have communities in a certain way , and they were a lot of the time .
so they either survived together , or they went together , and that meant that when a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were repeated repeatedly and from evolution .
now the key thing is , where these communities are so close to the same , they decided to write the recipe for the whole community in a more walkable place .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at that point , we &apos;ve got this , of course , of a lot of the communities , communities of many of the world &apos;s neurons , which are acting as a single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a kind of aversion of this community .
we have a lot of cells that are not prepared to be on themselves .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started developing , so that the level , which was the evolution , not longer the individual cell , but the whole of the whole cell that we call organism .
the next step is happening within this communities .
the most sophisticated started to abstract information .
and they developed special structures that made nothing else than information in the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the most important , which is the most powerful .
they started to train specialists within the community , special structures that were responsible for learning , understanding and holding information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of this community .
and this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point , an individual -- learning is now happening within the time of a single organism , rather than about this evolutionary period of time .
so an organism could learn to eat a certain delusion , because they were really miserable and made him sick , and he made him sick , the last time he ate her .
now this could happen within the life expectancy of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because this information had to be addressed by the individuals who died because of these , these are still the ones that died because of these , these are
so the nervous system has the most powerful thing with this particular kind of thing that &apos;s been given to the evolution of this particular thing .
she could take place within a climate room .
what happened after that is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate each other .
as an example , the most famous version of this is the human language of this kind of thing .
it &apos;s a really amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , and i was going to be a very complicated , and i was going to be embarrassed in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and basically , the sounds of me , in the hope of making a similar idea of what was going on in your head , which has a certain kind of resemblance with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , it &apos;s going to make it a sequence of sound , and produce a sequence of sound , and make something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this allows us to work again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we , humanity , is we &apos;ve started to abstract .
we &apos;re the same stages , which have been through the world &apos;s own -- the abstraction of our methods , how we put data , to process it .
so , for example , the language of language was a little step in this direction .
so , computer games , computer , quack , pixel and so on are all our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve built in our community to handle this information .
and it connects us all to something that is much bigger , and it &apos;s also going to be able to develop faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today , evolution can happen in the time period of microseconds .
you also saw a little bit of the little little bit of evolution where he showed a little bit of evolution in &quot; the &quot; code &quot; program , right from your eyes .
so we have the most sophisticated time again .
the first steps of history , which i told you , took a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , took a few hundred million years .
then the most sophisticated steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to take a few decades .
the process of feeding itself is going to feed itself and will be , i think , the word of the word -- if something is going to be a little bit more potent .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explosion .
we see the process that feeds from itself .
i live in a living of computers , and i know that i &apos;m going to use the mechanism i use to build computers , not use the time , without the recently , in computing , in computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design this in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is doing in the most sophisticated .
it has billions of them .
what i &apos;m doing instead , and what designers are doing thinking about is , we think of a certain kind of a little bit of a time process , and we &apos;re thinking about this machine , and the machine makes something that makes our skills far beyond ,
and it &apos;s partly about ways that we don &apos;t even understand that .
one method that &apos;s particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been using in the last time is the evolution itself .
we put a solar center in the machine , which is going on in the field of the world .
to call one example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that evolved from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , &quot; please , a hundred million randomly randomly sequences of instructions .
now , please all of these random instructions are going to run out of these things , and they &apos;re all going to vote from the world , and choose to choose the ones that are the next . &quot;
so in other words , i &apos;m first define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want numbers to sort of , that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve used for this .
so find programs that are most common numbers in numbers .
of course , the chance of random gods is very small that they just have numbers of numbers , so they &apos;re probably not going to actually do this .
but one of those things that may be happy to do with something is really lucky to get two numbers into the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequence , which came to my goals on the next .
store this off , the rest of the rest .
now , all the population of the world &apos;s population is the best of the most responsible in the world .
and with a method of the kind of , analog to reproduction , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their own , and the children are the characteristics of the most powerful of the two programs .
so i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that have come into the goals of the programs that have come to the goals .
say , &quot; please , this process . &quot;
nixon , again , again .
maybe some mutations will run .
and try and do this with another generation .
all of these generations require a few milliseconds .
and so i can go through a design about millions of years in the computer in a little few minutes , or in more complicated cases , some hours .
finally , i get programs that are perfectly able to reach the numbers perfect .
the fact is that these programs are so much more efficient than any program i ever could have ever written .
when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t say how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s obscure and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job , because you come from a series of the world &apos;s programs , which have done the job .
because your life was going to be if she was doing the job .
i sat in a 747 , with marvin minsky &apos;s card , and he said , &quot; oh look . look at this . look at this .
there &apos;s this airplane from a plastic street , which is working together to make their flight safer , do you don &apos;t do that ? &quot;
we know that a computer is not optimal if it becomes too complicated .
so we start to rely on computers , for a process which is different from classical engineering technology .
he allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it allows the normal methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t really understand the possibilities of it .
so , we &apos;re going to have a technology of technology .
we &apos;re now using these programs to make the computers much faster , so that we can do this more quickly .
so it creates a solar machine .
it will faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems like this so confusing .
because all these new technologies are feeding themselves from themselves .
we &apos;ll raise it .
we &apos;re at a point that is the analog to the back , when they have evolved to the back of the time , when they have a car structure .
so we &apos;re the most sophisticated and we can &apos;t really make the difference , which we &apos;re actually doing on the hell here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this .
but i really think that after us comes to something .
i think it &apos;s very fashionable to say that we are the result of evolution .
and i think we all are here in the creation of what &apos;s going on next .
now , lunch is before and i &apos;m thinking i &apos;m going to hear here before i &apos;m going to go back to the other day .
my story starts right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was in the desert in the desert with a plastic bank with the wooden salad ali .
we talked about it , that nothing has changed for the time of ancient indian &apos;s mahabharata . &quot;
when we wanted to travel , we went to a car and we went across the sky .
now we do this with airplanes .
and then when the big indian was sent up , he took a bow , took a bow , fired in the floor and water .
now we do this with a little bit of the time and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that really did me .
i got a little scared of technology .
it made me fear that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without a camera and without tweet on my friends .
i found that technology should make magic and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver sandwich .
this piece of age was the most 50 of the time for me .
she was a world of pirates to a world full of pirates and plastic ships and pictures in my mind .
i came to the same way when we were holding the clocks , and we had cameras from the sun .
they were inspired to be inspired by it .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic rather than killing .
with 16 , i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling , the reader can connect all over the world .
it can tell how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it brings pictures and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
the storytelling is always needed more senses .
but what do we do with this ?
i &apos;m just going to go to the process of being able to make a interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s : &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s the box , &quot; this box is going to be -- &quot; i write my name .
and from me , a character is going to be in the book .
and a letter down to me , and the ipad knows , and the ipad knows that gps is where i live -- is right to me .
the child in me is really really excited about this opportunity .
i talked a lot about magic .
i mean , i don &apos;t mean a magician and kites , but the magic of childhood , those ideas we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i found quite exciting .
so you have to dump the ipad up here and take fireflies off .
and the light is the way that the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that &apos;s fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can be in a single brain .
and so every book , and every world , and every world , i &apos;m going to get here to the magic device that i &apos;m wearing here in the field .
and this opens up a map .
and the other thing that had maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows and it &apos;s going to be on charge of the book in the rest of the book .
it turns out to be in other places .
i &apos;m going to go here .
and it &apos;s important for me to make something that is more powerful , but also very much of a time .
this is the most important .
we &apos;ve all heard of the data and the most powerful , but how many people outside india are familiar with india , the most important of the people ?
the poor were caught in the harbor chambers , in a old school book , in a old book book .
and we bring them back to an contemporary history for children .
a story that &apos;s very similar to the new issues , like the most powerful .
the theme of the subject , a big problem of the last 10 years is that children sit in their rooms , in their own computers , without out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you sent to a search . you have to go out and collect the ipads of the ipads of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of the family of the furniture , rocks , and post-docs .
it doesn &apos;t make the kids more .
this is a little bit of salt , and you have to go out to go out to a picture of a flower and tag it .
in another chapter you have to play a piece of light and tag .
so , you actually create a digital collection of photos that you can then put online .
a child in london shows the picture of a football machine , and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities that are in the world , and the world and technology .
the next book we &apos;re planning to design a interaction in the ipads , and through augmented reality , it looks like a animation from the house , which shows on a plant from the house .
and on a place , the screen is filling up with leaves .
you have to do the sound of the design , and you &apos;re going to read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the forces of technology are closer and closer to the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and closer to the natural world , and we have a little bit of the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in the prison , prisons or a community .
i spend most of my time with the social weakest in the world &apos;s business and places that are very much despair .
here at ted , to see and hear how an intentional that is , i gave a lot of force .
in the short time , i was a clear one : ted has identity .
you can tell things about the world that have influence .
and sometimes , if something comes over ted , it gets an significance and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we saw some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of one teacher have a great meaning , but the words of a dedicated teacher is particularly meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . but as a doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn that in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i was big in a family , a traditional household household , who was dominated by a terminal , and this 11-year-old one was my grandmother .
she was a very strong , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every single country .
she was also the starting point of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a baby company .
their parents were born in the polling debate as a slave .
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped her way very much .
my grandmother was a lot of , but she was also loving .
when i met them as a little boy , they came to me and gave me a coach .
she was so stuck that i could barely breathe . then she would go to me .
or two hours later , if i came to her , she came up to me and said , &quot; you know , you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; i said , &quot; i said , &quot; i said , &quot; i did it in quiet . &quot;
and she was something that was made in her close .
the only problem was that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins walked around everywhere .
i remember , i have to have eight or nine that i woke up one morning and went to the living room . all my cousins were walking around .
my grandmother was at the end of the room and i was staring at it .
first of all , i thought that was a game .
i saw her and smiles , but she looked very serious .
that &apos;s how 15 minutes went , and then she stood up and she came up to me . she took me on the hand and said , &quot; come on , &quot; come on , you know , we need to talk .
i remember it as if it was yesterday .
i never forget it .
she took me outside and said , &quot; i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t have to be able to get it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and saw me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise me only three things , &quot; you &apos;ve got to promise . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i &apos;m going to be able to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby and you have to have a promise to you , you &apos;ll always care about them . &quot;
i &apos;m encouraging my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; next to me , you &apos;ll always be doing the right thing . &quot; even if it falls hard , the right thing to do .
i thought , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise me is &quot; you never will be drinking alcohol . &quot;
now , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yeah , grandma . i promise . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south and i have a brother who &apos;s older and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this home beer with my sister , and i went to the forest and went with us in the forest .
we just put it around as well as anything else .
then he took a drink of beer and offered my sister to one of them , and she took me to one of them .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . it &apos;s just done . i don &apos;t want to do beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , now we &apos;re doing this , you &apos;re doing everything we do .
i had what i had , your sister had what . go , a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . do it just . make it just . &quot;
my brother was staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
then he saw me in the face , and he said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not always doing you , &quot; i don &apos;t always do it for the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells all the grandchildren that they are special . &quot;
i was devastated at the bottom .
i &apos;m going to give you a little bit of a return .
i probably shouldn &apos;t do that .
this may be a public crisis .
i &apos;m a 52 years old , and i &apos;m a little bit of a drop of alcohol , i &apos;m not going to drink a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s a little bit of time . i say that , because identity is doing it .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people about things that they don &apos;t believe in .
we can get them to do things they thought they could not .
of course my grandmother would say all of their grandchildren , they &apos;re special .
my grandfather was during the prison department in prison .
my uncle died of the u.s. disease .
and they believed that this is the issues that we need to care about .
i tried to say something about our medical court .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in the back , 300,000 people were in the prison store and in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest state rate in the world .
seven million people are released on on the verge of the city or with disabilities .
i think the world &apos;s fundamental changes in the world .
in social , and the population of the population is to share despair and hopelessness because of these changes .
one of three , black black black among 18 and 30 is in prison , in the prison , on the ground , or with surfing logging .
in urban communities everywhere -- from los angeles , over philadelphia , baltimore -- are 50 to 60 percent of all the black men either in prison , in prison , on on the ground , on the ground or with surfing .
our system is not just shaped by questions that have to do with the power of information , it &apos;s also being executed by poverty .
we have a marine court in this country that they &apos;re treating much better if they &apos;re rich and guilty as poor and innocent .
assets , not draw , the result is affecting .
but we seem to be very pleased with it .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a couple of things that are happening there .
my home home is permanently chasing you , if you &apos;re convicted of the right thing .
here , in alabama , in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population is permanently lost .
we predict that in 10 years the ratio of civic health is going to be so high , as the average of the world &apos;s population .
silence is a constant .
i represent kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world , the most important children in prison .
in this country , there &apos;s been a lot of life for children without more effective .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of ways .
the only country in the world .
i represent people in the street .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we think because you &apos;ve taught us that the real question is : does a human being made for him to die for a drug of him ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other way is not : does anybody think of a crime , but do we deserve it ? do we deserve it ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
on nine people we &apos;ve executed , one of the things we &apos;ve executed is , we have a commitment to be skeptical and that &apos;s been released from death rates .
an amazing piece of discovery . one of nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane if for nine planes , the route of a crash .
but somehow we can do it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking about that questions .
i talk about race and the question , whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m in african-american history , i &apos;m talking about slavery . i talk about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , the time against the cutting of the reconstruction , until the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know about it very much .
but for the african-american people in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be scared of the other .
or before bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
these older people now come to me and say , &quot; mr , voila , you &apos;re talking to talks . you say people should stop saying that we should have to stop to do it in the history of our nation : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the polluted and decades of motivated commitment and apartheid .
and yet , in our country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what meaning our actions in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly hitting each other .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to be willing to get us to the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people have understood that the life-saving is not to overcome the willingness to be the willingness and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve been holding some talks in germany about death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up after my talk , and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s profoundly valid , you &apos;re talking to me . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , it can never give you more . &quot;
it &apos;s been very silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever can kill the systematic to kill people .
it would be a little bit of a time to be aware of us , and we &apos;re acting in humans . &quot;
i thought about it .
how it would feel like to live in a world where german state was leaving people , especially if there were a lot of jews .
it would be evelyn .
it would be a little bit more unfair .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we &apos;re going to be people to be convicted of death , 11 times higher , to be charged by death , 11 times higher when the death is black , and the same state
and yet there &apos;s this mental disconnection .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with this , with these difficult topics , the positive and wonderful things are affected as well .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but eventually , these realities are going to be suffering from suffering , abuse , of apartheid , apartheid .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we ultimately talk about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to be able to be in a complex world .
for me , this is what &apos;s going to happen to me , and talk about the poor , and talking about the poor , the disadvantaged , who never will be at ted .
but think about a kind of , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like in our own lives .
we all have to believe in the last thing that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re so rational , so we &apos;re very rational to mind .
innovation , creativity , and development is not just from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this kind of thing that i think is that they &apos;re driving us , not just to be open for all the bright and more and more of things , but also for the dark and the most effective .
maddie : the great one of the people who have the great cats .
&quot; when we fought in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted to be able to do everything , but what we needed most , was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be sometimes in the bare places , and witness to be witness . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i believe is also the most important thing to do .
there &apos;s no variation to get technology and design that allows us to be very human , and we have a personal , and ears , and ears , and the injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity requires a lot more from us than if we didn &apos;t have it .
it &apos;s going to touch them deeply .
as a young lawyer , i &apos;m the great privilege to meet pink parks .
and he kept back to the last time , and he returned to the head of time where she was two of her oldest friends , and the older women , the most prolific women , had the most powerful , and an incredible african-american -- and virginia king ,
so these women were meeting and they were just talking .
and then , by the time , the woman called me , and he said , &quot; well , the woman parks , &quot; the lady parks , we want to talk to you .
do you want to sit in and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yeah , really like . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just heard .
it was always so inspiring , so that it was so inspiring .
one day i was sitting there and heard these women , and after a few hours , woman was going to tell me , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to say what the initiative is right .
what do you try to get ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to work against injustice .
people want to help people who have been convicted of innocent .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the coastal field .
we want to eliminate the world &apos;s population without any more effective for children .
we want to do something against death companies .
we want to lower the number of death numbers .
we want to eradicate the food team . &quot;
i thought my usual talk , and after i saw it , and she said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go . &quot;
she said , &quot; it will make you very , very tired . &quot;
and then woman turned to me , and he put a finger on my face , and he said , &quot; and therefore , you have to be very , very eager . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be the ted revolution .
we need to make ways of putting ourselves together , to make these problems , this aspiration , that suffering .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a few very simple things .
we all are more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every human being on the planet .
if someone lies , it &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t hear him , it &apos;s not just a symbiotic .
even who kills someone , not only is a killer .
and because that &apos;s what &apos;s happening is there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity to respect the law .
i think in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think that in many places that the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i think that , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so an inspiring , we &apos;re not going to be measured at the end of our technology , not in the things that we &apos;re developing , not in our intellect
finally , a society is not measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged , but it &apos;s how they deal with the poor , the terminal , the terminal , the terminal .
because in this context , we start to understand that really amazing things that make us feel .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story to finish .
sometimes i urge too much .
i &apos;m tired of how we all do .
sometimes social these ideas are going to advance to the very important way of thinking about it .
i represent these kids who were convicted of very hard people who were convicted of very hard .
i &apos;m going to go to the street and visit a client who may be 13 or 14 years ago , and that &apos;s a grown in a court .
then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn someone into something that he doesn &apos;t ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed too long on and thought , oh , my goodness , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he must have a lot of time .
right , the judge , the judge has a military force .
you should also ask you what .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think of it anymore , i started working on a bill .
i had a 14 year-old young young boys as clients .
and i started with this bill , the headline said , &quot; bill , my arms , 14 arms clients like a privileged , white , white , more colorful . &quot;
in my bill , i explained that error was the most popular and the police and the police .
there was a crazy line about this , that in this country , nothing more sophisticated is that there &apos;s only error .
the next morning , i woke up and i didn &apos;t know if i had just dreamed of this crazy bill or actually written it .
and i didn &apos;t just write him , but also sent to the court .
a few months later , and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go into the court and this crazy case .
i went into the car , and i was really overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard to do this .
and then i went out of my car , and i went up the stairs .
when i was the staircase to the court , there was an elderly , black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came over and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and sat me .
then he went to the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched something deeply deeply in me , identity , the ability to contribute every single one , to a community of hope .
well , i walked the street .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. selinger , did you put this crazy bill ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to debate .
increasingly , people came in , just because they were angry .
i wrote that crazy stuff .
and i was in the front and the office office and office workers and office workers .
in the most prolific part , the most terrifying thing was the full of people who were angry that we talked about color , about poverty , about inequality , about inequality .
i looked at the janitors and i went out .
he always saw the window and he could hear the whole thing that was going on .
he went and down .
finally , this older black man came with a very connected job in the prison room and sat straight behind me , almost on the street .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a pause .
during the break , a college student was in the case that the janitors were in the prison room .
this is the most old run over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the most delicious ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he saw the most white , then he saw me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m coming to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say that this young man is going to say , &quot; don &apos;t get the mind
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far more popular , but that it &apos;s the justice of the universe .
we &apos;re not fully designed as humans , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and business .
that our lives are being connected to each individual .
that we have to connect our visions of technology and design , entertainment and creativity with humanity , pity and justice .
and especially i want to see these of you who are just seeing that , just say , lose the goal of the eyes . don &apos;t give up .
they have this audience , this community , and the one of the things that we &apos;ve seen is to help you and do something .
what can we do ?
majora wolfe : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a double center in this spring that it &apos;s about to do a effort , something that &apos;s going to be done in the politics of punishment , which is the other of the people that are flowing in the politics of
here , in california , for example , you will be a billion dollars for the death penalty , a billion dollars for death .
and yet , 46 percent of all the oil companies don &apos;t end with an accidental .
56 percent of all the world &apos;s research cells don &apos;t come from court .
there &apos;s the chance to do something .
this is a very popular one that &apos;s going to suggest money in more energy and security .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the most powerful is in america .
this fact is often asked in a context with the increased gas distribution .
what would you say to someone who believes ?
now , in fact , the number of the internet companies don &apos;t really change it very much .
most of the most popular in this country didn &apos;t really find in the class of the world &apos;s class .
it was the most popular , the cat &apos;s memorial against drugs .
so the dramatic rates are coming to the prisoners .
we have made ourselves a lot of the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have &quot; the &quot; s &quot; -- the people who bring people over to the grid , for a more violent , for the theft of good , rather than that you force them , the things that give back the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a more powerful , not less .
and i think our current health system doesn &apos;t help anybody .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
so , you &apos;ve got a string here , you &apos;ve got a string to simulate .
they &apos;re inspiring personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
bin laden is going to be a decrease with a decrease with it .
famine in somalia . women &apos;s marriage , spray of the police .
four : increased food cycles . the speaker are less dangerous .
six : social benefits . the speaker , 65 : 65 .
speaker : five : a speaker .
different speakers . mass theory . tornado .
recession . a standstill . egypt . egypt . syria .
crisis . death .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could be the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media prefer to show us negative topics because our minds are really given attention to these issues .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second every day , our senses will catch much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first stop stop for all the information is part of our temporal lobe , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early age , our main system .
it &apos;s a contradiction and the whole information that &apos;s going to be the whole information on the search for any kind of danger in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; if it &apos;s a little bit more , the demand is very true . &quot;
now , with all our digital devices that seven days the week , 24 hours a day , all these negative news is not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s always worse .
but maybe this is not the case .
possibly that &apos;s the reality .
perhaps the vast progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century is made by a series of forces , so that it &apos;s going to be able to make us possible in the next three decades , a world of abundance .
now , i don &apos;t say we have a big problem -- climate crisis , water crisis , water and energy issues -- we &apos;ve already got .
and as humans , we &apos;re much better at that , and they &apos;re very much more comfortable with the problems of being able to get into the very long term .
so let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , which has been addicted to inflation in the world &apos;s population .
child mortality has reduced a tenth .
and that &apos;s that the most important , more cosmopolitan , and communication effects , have reduced a baby bar .
steve pinker has shown us that we currently live in a very peaceful time of the world &apos;s life .
and according to charles iyengar , the most prolific in the last 130 years of 25 percent of the year is up .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations continuously .
in fact , we have a new redefine poverty .
remember that a big fraction of americans living under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , the bikes , the telephone , the control , the air sheets and cars .
the richest of the last century , the most important of the earth , would never have any such luxury to be able to dream of .
the basis of a lot of these technologies , and these are growing things .
my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that is going to be done in information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , is a great sketch of the project , and the most 12 to 24 months .
so this is why the mobile phone costs about a million times less and less than a supercomputer than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law last hundred years .
notice two things about this curve .
first , how smooth they &apos;re -- in good ways , war or peace , recession , depression and the civil bombsight .
this is the result of faster computers building faster computers .
it &apos;s slowed down for none of our big problems .
and also , despite your logarithmic glass on the left , it &apos;s going up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , at moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to all of them .
&quot; the &quot; aw , &quot; something that my friends call in autodesk , sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers , the printer that allow us to democratize the personal production of our planet , synthetic biology , fuel and food , digital medicine , and the digital
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm &apos;s supercomputer &apos;s risk of the &quot; risk of &quot; risk ? &quot;
that was great .
i &apos;ve been looking for newspapers and looking for the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson , &quot; the blind of the human enemy .
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the language of the language .
imagine that these artificial intelligence of each owner would be available to each other &apos;s staff .
four years ago , ray kurzweil launched and i &apos;m at ted , a new university called singularity university .
we bring our students to all these technologies with special focus , and we can focus on how this used to solve the big challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask students to create companies , products , products and services that are within a decade that will affect the lives of billions of people .
think about that , that a group of students can influence the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous in the case .
today we can run up for dozens of companies that have exactly this .
if i think of creating abundance , i don &apos;t mean a living full of luxury for anyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about making a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating from the age of the goods .
scarcity is a lot of the pr , and technology is a resource of a resource .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of sunscreen in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of the house to dinner .
the soldiers got a lot of time , mutilated , mutilated .
but the king of the street was got a lot of time .
aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , valuable than gold and dispersants .
this is why the dome was made of aluminum from aluminum .
although aluminum is a percentage of the u.s. &apos;s population , it &apos;s not going to be a pure metal .
it &apos;s connected to oxygen and water .
but then the technology of the design was developed and made the plastics so cheap that we use it with our food system .
then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we think of the math today .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet of the world with a more violent energy than we consume a year .
16 hundred of the ocean &apos;s energy is all crossing the ocean &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is free .
and there are good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve been able to reduce the cost of solar energy in india , 50 percent of the average of the world &apos;s energy -- compared to 17 rupees in the comparison of 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy is last year for 50 percent .
last month , this has published a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the united states , solar energy is six cents a gallon in the national average , compared to 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have an oxygen effort , we &apos;ll also have water in the abundance .
let &apos;s talk about the internet .
remember , as carl sagan , the most prolific in 1990 , when it was in saturn , then in direction , in direction ?
he took a famous photograph . how was it ?
&quot; a &quot; blue blue australian crow . &quot;
because we live on a bicycle table .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered by 70 percent water .
yes , it &apos;s a percent of the saltwater , two percent are more sinister , and we fight about 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new design points on the way , and it &apos;s a new way .
and from a conversation today with dean atwood , one of the innovators of doing it , i want to share with you -- he gave me permission -- he gave me permission -- his mother , which is the &quot; the &quot; s &quot; -- and i &apos;ve got
it can produce a thousand liters of clean water per day , whether in the saltwater , if seawater , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents per gallon .
the president of coca-cola has just been to start a big school machine with a hundred units in developing countries .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola will apply this technology globally to the whole planet .
this is a little bit of innovation that &apos;s now there .
and we &apos;ve seen this in mobile phones .
you know , my goodness , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 2013 .
just consider that a computer cell with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better way of 25 years ago than president reagan .
and if you look for your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowing and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the abundance of how nobody could have predicted .
and it &apos;s still better , the things you &apos;ve spent and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , and the picture , libraries and music , technology to medical imaging -- are literally becoming more sophisticated and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best thing is , perhaps , what &apos;s going to be in the realm of health .
and in the last month , i had the pleasure of the so-called the so-called 10 million of the world &apos;s worth of 2 million nobel prize prize .
we demand teams all over the world , all these technologies in a mobile phone that can be connected to the device , because it &apos;s with ai , it can be able to test the device , you can test it or test your body &apos;s .
and to win , the device has to provide a better diagnosis than a team of a team .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the people of health care and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
if this device sequenced a little bit of a sudden or a little bit of a sudden , it &apos;s not calling the recovery of the time , and it &apos;s a pandemic of your outbreak .
but now to the biggest force that will lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the world &apos;s population .
and by the way , the biggest health of the world &apos;s population is a better education and nutrition in the world .
in 2010 , we had a lot of millions of people online , and we had a lot of time online .
until 2020 , we increase a ride from two billion internet internet internet sites .
three billion new heads of the kids we &apos;ve never heard before , will be the global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what will they want to be ?
and instead of economic disasters , i see one of the largest economic mechanisms of history .
these people represent several trillion dollars that are going to be flowing in global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be engaged by using the use of the food system , and they &apos;re trained by the power of the world , and they &apos;re going to be trained to use 3d printers and &quot; the &quot; and &quot; more productive computing , &quot; and
so what can three billion growing , healthy , educated members of the world &apos;s brain services , bring us to the human rights ?
like it &apos;s about a sentence of new , never before .
how about it , the oppressed , where they &apos;re , is to give a voice to be careful and create change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people getting ?
how about the design of the world that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i learned through the x prize is that little teams are motivated by passion and focus , extraordinary things , things that are able to create large businesses and governments only in the past .
i want to finish with a story that really really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might know already .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to evolve .
and after his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the most important .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university professors and so on .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online .
and it turns out that today the human recognition recognition pattern is better the proteins that are the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked at who the best was the world &apos;s best , it wasn &apos;t a military system , it was no more a , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was working in the day and the best of
ladies and gentlemen , what &apos;s enormous trust in our future is the fact that we &apos;re doing more than individuals to make us the big challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a design .
we have the capital of the internet .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work online to master the new challenges , and to do what is necessary .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to have something against a network of medical culture .
and i think it &apos;s starting to be a medical doctor and i &apos;m .
and maybe i &apos;m a long enough time in business , as i can allow it to give up a piece of my own wrong word to allow this to be able to get this .
but before i &apos;m talking to the actual issue of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re the most close and moving to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; the &quot; s &quot; is soon coming and turns around statistics and to use these to be a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to be on a statistic that i hope that most of you have heard of .
it &apos;s the most popular of the design .
we talk about a 300 , if a bat beat 300 .
that means the player is safe to beat three of 10 .
this means the ball to stick in the street , he &apos;s going to be caught , and he &apos;s not caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball on the first base , it doesn &apos;t have time and the cover of security .
three out of 10 out of 10 .
you know how to call a football center in the gulf of the football horse ?
well , really good , maybe a more powerful .
you know how to call a laser game ?
this is somebody who &apos;s certainly four out of 10 out of 10 .
so , the ted writer -- like ted williams -- the last league of the foreign horse , who met during a normal season over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world in medicine , which i feel about a few more comfortable or perhaps a little bit less likely to think about that i &apos;ve been talking about .
imagine a computer &apos;s book and you &apos;re going to hire a nuclear prize to be a 400 year-old in terms of the air .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine life in a certain remote area , and they have a beloved people with clogged plastic and their favorite friends to a plastic system that &apos;s in the middle of 200 .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better than this year . it &apos;s on the edge of the limb .
and she &apos;s going to beat a laser counter .
it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the most important thing about a design or a nurse or a nurse or a a computer show , should be a viable , a car machine ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody knows in the entire medicine , which should be a good surgeon or a doctor or a doctor .
but what we do is we &apos;re in each of them , including me , to put out the world with the claim perfect .
never make any mistakes , no one makes you think about the details of how this is going to be done .
and that &apos;s the message i put in medical school .
i was a loaner of a student .
in high school , a mother said that brian was learning to learn a blood test .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little business in the sisters in the sisters , the toronto general hospital , and i was in the toronto of here .
i learned everything .
i learned the origins of the origins and the tail of every single branch of any branch , every branch of a every artery , which is the aorta , the most terrifying and common .
i even knew the most popular about classify the design of the internet .
and the whole time i got more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i was raised with a little bit of the time .
and i left medical school with the impression that i knew if i knew everything and knew everything , or so much , or so much as possible , as possible , that i was immune to make mistakes .
and it worked for a time until i met a woman &apos;s printer .
i was going to teach you a tour of this in toronto as a woman in toronto , and i was brought into the hospital code of the hospital .
at this point , i was starving the most popular layer in the field of service .
and it was my assignment when the most salient piece of advice was looking at the most important thing to study .
and i &apos;m going to start to give feedback on my favorite .
i studied wife , and she was in the street lab .
and when i write her , she made sounds like this .
and when i was using her chest with the most prolific , i could hear a sound of sound on both sides that told me that she was suffering under the heart of the heart .
this is a state that &apos;s failing , rather than breaking the entire blood on the blood , and it &apos;s stuck a part of the blood cells in the lung and they get that slowly , so the most sophisticated thing came out .
and that was not hard to do that .
i put them and made me care of the treatment .
i gave her an award . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine , which we call the water , water pills , so that they &apos;re the fluid .
and over a time of a long one , one to two hours , she started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i did my first mistake ; i sent them home .
i actually made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my favorite .
i didn &apos;t take the phone and i did what i should have been a call at my heart of my birthday , so that he had a chance to make a chance to make a chance of doing a very different picture .
and he knew it , he would have had additional information to her more .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the most honest doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility , that i was able to make it so i could put it in my patients without putting him back .
my second mistake was worse .
and so i sent them home , i &apos;m a quiet voice in my mind , trying to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . do it not . &quot;
in fact , i &apos;m very comfortable to say that i asked the nurse , which is about woman printer , &quot; do you believe it &apos;s all right when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and he said in a way , &quot; clear , i think it &apos;s going to go well . &quot;
i remember it as being yesterday .
so i was praying , and an ambulance and a comet and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this nagging feeling in my stomach .
but i continued to work .
and at the end of the day , i joined my stuff , and the hospital and went to the parking room to go home with the car , when i did something i didn &apos;t do .
i went home with the most sophisticated walk on my way home .
and there was another nurse , and there was no other nurse who had seen the wife , but another three words to me and the three words that i &apos;m afraid to be understood .
other doctors fear this as well , but the environmental care is very , very special because we just see the patient so that we can get the patient .
the three words loud : remember ?
&quot; remember the patient you &apos;d been wondering for ? &quot;
asked the nurse to see .
so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular particular piece of view .
so she was back .
she was back and dying .
about one hour after that she got home , after i got home , she collapsed and the family called 911 . the baby was brought back to the front of the house with a blood pressure from 50 , which is a dangerous one .
they breathe hardly and was blue .
the most powerful thing was all the strands .
they gave her their ass .
they closed them on the top of the road .
i was shocked to go into the inner office .
and i was running through these rollercoaster because they came to care of the intensive care care , and i hoped they would recover .
and after two , three days , it realized that they never would impress again .
she didn &apos;t have a scaled up the internet .
their family started getting together .
and over the course of the next eight or nine days , she led to the most prolific .
the day day , she goes to her -- woman printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say that you &apos;re never happy to forget the names of the world .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
the next weeks i was killing claims and i learned the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself alone , isolated , not the way of healthy shame you feel because you can &apos;t talk about the colleagues about it .
you know , you all know the healthy shame , if you have a secret of the best friend , although this one is on a slippery basis and then you get caught and the best friend is going to get a little bit and get a little bit of
if you do it , and you never do the mistakes again .
this is the kind of kind of peer-to-peer shame .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one that makes one in the heart of the very sick .
it &apos;s the one who says that , not what you &apos;ve done , it &apos;s bad , but you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t in my favorite , he was very happy .
he talked to the family and i &apos;m sure he was making the protesters and sure i didn &apos;t get sued .
but i asked myself to ask that questions .
why did i not ask the most important thing ? why would i send them home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a stupid mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
but slowly it made it .
i started feeling better .
and then on a plane day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke up and i might be able to feel better again .
and i was out of that if i doubled my efforts to perfection and never made a mistake to make a mistake that the voice could be made .
and she did .
and i continued to work .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the prison hospital in a hospital hospital north of toronto , and i was documenting a 25 years old , and i was packed in a half of the toronto .
it was a lot of time and i in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked at the art and it was a little bit pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and yet , as he went out of the door , he showed him his job .
two days later , i came to my next birthday , and my favorite card was asked me to talk to her office .
and she said the three words : remember you ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the patient &apos;s office ? &quot;
it turns out he was a little bit of a sudden .
he had potentially a potentially potentially valid disease called the &quot;
you can google , but it &apos;s not infection of the most prolific , but the top of the body is the top of the body and it &apos;s the top of the body &apos;s .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got a little bit more engaged and recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same kind of kind of a shame of shame and self-doubt , and went to work on the work until it came back and again and again and again .
in a corporate museum , i &apos;ve been missing two times a second .
there &apos;s a lot of this , especially if you think of it , you &apos;re working in a hospital that has only 14 patients a night .
in both cases i didn &apos;t send them home , and there was no pencils in their treatment .
i thought he was having a lot of time .
i was projecting the x-ray of the kidney . when that was without a plastic system , my colleague was holding a little bit of the time in the lower right sector , and called the surgeons .
the other was very much diarrhea .
i was projecting the most educated to go to the front of him and asked my colleagues to test him too .
and he did it and he was doing a very low in the right sector , called the surgeons .
in both cases , it was a lot of time , and it was good .
both of the cases of mine , i &apos;m on .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues , but it &apos;s total nonsense .
some of my favorite projects happened in the last five years .
alone , it &apos;s transparent and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t end with my mistakes and talk about them , if i can &apos;t tell the silent voice that i &apos;m saying , what &apos;s really happening , what &apos;s going on to me ?
how can i teach you my mistakes , so that they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i was in a room -- like now , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking about me .
when did you hear the last time from someone who was talking about the most of the time about the internet revolution ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party party and you may hear about any other doctor , but you don &apos;t hear somebody about your own mistakes .
if i had a full of colleagues , and asked to ask their immediate support and they started telling them what i &apos;m telling you , i would probably not get the end of the second story , and i would say , &quot; i &apos;m probably not going to
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues , that a child had lost the wrong leg in my hospital , then you believe i would have trouble to look at the eyes .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system that there are two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do . those who break sleep and without the limitation of the people who have a little results and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological reaction like antibodies that attack people .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we &apos;re the ones who are making mistakes from medicine , we &apos;re going to be a safe system .
but there are two problems in this .
in my about 20 years of medical war and journalism , i have a personal medical study on medical mistakes and false treatments to make all of me possible for a first article that i wrote for the toronto star .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely transformative .
we &apos;re working in a system that &apos;s going to be mistake in every day where one of 10 people are either a false or wrong , and it &apos;s always a false , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be a more prosperous and
in this state , about 24,000 canadians die of a lot of the way .
in the united states , the institute of medicine has been the number of 100,000 .
both are strong , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as well as we should .
and it &apos;s the most important thing .
in a corporate class , all of the time , all of the two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
sleep is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error , so we can take a perfect track of a patient with an patient with chest chest .
then i take the same patient with a little bit of the brain , and i &apos;ll make it a little bit of a breath and give you a slightly bit of breath and suddenly , and it &apos;s a little bit of a time to do with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same course .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me the symptoms of their symptoms in the same way .
all of that is a combination of errors .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and all the most cosmopolitan of the brain is edited out , then nobody else is left .
and you know the most important about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , white , black , black , i have the habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake to every one of the most of the time to the train , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; blah , blah , blah ,
and then their fortunes expand , they &apos;ve come to the head , and they &apos;re looking at it , and they &apos;re hard to go and go and tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what you need is a environment that you can do in the situation .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new world is a human being , a human , white , and it &apos;s not proud of making it error , but it &apos;s all about learning to learn to learn so it can be passed .
they share their experiences with other people .
they &apos;re supporting when others talk about their mistakes .
and it shows other people &apos;s mistakes , not to be more inclusive , but in a profession , so that all of these benefits are benefits .
and she works in an medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life and if that &apos;s so , people are also making mistakes of time .
so that the system is going to be able to create the design of the system that makes it easier to make mistakes , and it makes people feel , and it allows you to create , supportive spaces , which are the potential of the health system , which
my name is brian serra .
i &apos;m the new world .
i &apos;m a human . i do mistakes .
i &apos;ve been struck by the best i &apos;m trying to learn to learn to do it .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding from me , but i can live with it .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , small idea .
it &apos;s about the most delicious .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you about three stories to use the time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , it was in venice .
you might think he painted a little bit of chewing , but that &apos;s not true .
it actually collected fish .
he described one of them as a very common .
it was a computer designer .
in the &apos; 80s , it was stored in great style .
now , he &apos;s on the red list , species .
and this story we &apos;ve heard of many times from the galapagos or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the main world is still the pinnacle of the world .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is to have another concept that &apos;s the most important thing to do , and it &apos;s a very simple story .
because i &apos;ve experienced it as i was studying a lagoon in a nazi town .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad biopsy and i was convinced that i was really not there .
it was my first edible .
as you see , the lagoon were in the diaspora and a few of the trees .
there was a subset of about 20 inches , and there was a subset of the u.s. prize .
the polar tree of these twin seals were very productive and they were doing good and made it over well in ghana .
when i returned to 27 years later , the fish dropped on half of his size .
adult prices are five centimeters .
they were genetically exposed to the species .
it still was fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had the lucky , nor to be there .
so it &apos;s not changed , and yet it &apos;s changed everything .
my third little story of my favorite story is about the introduction of the world &apos;s office in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- more early to the 1960s -- the united states europe .
and the other thing that countries had started to do is , they were starting to have a very ugly ship , called the industrial fishing ship that was pretty ugly .
i went to the entire southern sea , and we did the whole southern sea of sea and especially in the most remote .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know that it was the reason the ocean was .
90 percent of our favorite were sponges , other animals that are connected to the reason .
the biggest part of the fish that the small dots on the rubble were the most prolific , the most cosmopolitan .
basically , the bottom of the ocean came back and thrown thrown off .
these images are extraordinary because the transition is very quick .
within a year , you get an survey and starts with the commercial fishing .
the reason is it changes . from this , in this case -- a hard reason or soft coral is going to be a mess .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
once we started a living life .
she was not drowning .
then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat it well .
in fact , this mountain of the jaipur year is established by the fishermen , if they &apos;re going to go in areas where they &apos;ve never been saved .
it &apos;s not going to be documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we &apos;re not touching our new level of magnitude , and we don &apos;t call ourselves memory , which was there .
if you &apos;re doing it , what happens .
on the y-axis , some good things are : biodiversity , number of the world &apos;s dna , the green of the country , the most green .
it &apos;s changing . it changes , because for people , they &apos;re all of their actions .
every generation of the images that you &apos;re looking at is the beginning of your conscious life , as a standard and everything is able to get it .
the difference is going to be seen as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
it can give you a order of changes .
and at the end of the end , they just want to get the most frequent remains .
that &apos;s largely our goal .
we want to get things that are gone or things that are not like that , how they were .
you could think that the problem was that the problem was that the problem was that they were living in the world , and they were killing animals and they were actually aware of a few generations , which they had done .
because obviously , an animal that was very often very often , just once , before it &apos;s been more , before it &apos;s been .
so you don &apos;t lose the most common animals .
you always lose the rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not going to be a big loss .
and at the time , we &apos;re focusing on the big animals and in the ocean , the big fish are the big fish .
they &apos;re getting less likely because we start .
and the time is there &apos;s a little bit of fish left , and we think that &apos;s the most important thing .
the question is , why do people accept this ?
well , because they don &apos;t know that once again , it was different .
of course , many people are going to confirm scientists , to confirm that it was really different .
they &apos;ll confirm it because the evidence , as they &apos;re in an early form of references , are not like the evidence of the evidence .
for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of a computer report , which is a big school report , can &apos;t be used in this area , or from the federal war , because it &apos;s not , &quot; scientifically , &quot; because it &apos;s not &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in educated societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the vast big role that can play a marine reserve .
because in the field of marine field , we basically put the past back .
we &apos;re looking back for the past that people can &apos;t understand because the most low thing is , and very low .
so , people who see a marine reserve and they see the ones that are going to be able to do it , to reset their own energy .
what about the people who are not possible because they don &apos;t have access -- the people in the middle west for example ?
here , i think , i think , the art and the film may fill the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was a lot of time ago -- 500 years ago .
and the most important and the most important thing you might remember is &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think of &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were touched so much -- besides the most important , why were they touched by the most important , why were they touched by the most important ?
because it &apos;s something that has been lost in a way that &apos;s lost in a way .
so my recommendation , the only one i &apos;m going to give , is cameron , so he &apos;s turning &quot; avatar ii &quot; under water .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist , you had to have a typewriter , if you had a typewriter , that one in the government .
they also had to put a sheet of a banana set of the typewriter .
the reason that the government was able to cover track , where a text came from .
they found a paper with a little bit of the time , they could detect the creator of these thoughts .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anyone could do something like this , and how much the speech of speech would be left .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
but if you &apos;re in 2011 today in 2011 , a new school of the leading world and print a page , then it has light , and then it &apos;s a light that &apos;s going to be bright down on every page , in a pattern that makes the
this is what happens today .
and nobody seems to be a more inclusive .
and that was an example of what our own governments are the technology against us , the citizens , use .
and this is one of the three main stages of the existing world today .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three main classes .
there &apos;s a lot of food .
for example , this is mr. &apos;s favorite of the most delicious , in ukraine in ukraine .
and the motives of the brain are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use the water to make a lot of money , a huge pile of money .
there &apos;s several known cases of the internet , and it &apos;s a lot of time that you have made your money through attacks .
this is a little bit of a street designer in estonia .
this is alfred atwood .
stephen watt .
so , the math team .
these are matthew anderson , and so on and so on and so on .
these people have come to wealth , but they &apos;ve acquired it illegal by using a tomato sauce for example , to make money from our bank centers , while we &apos;re doing our online system , or we &apos;re doing a computer system online , and we &apos;re flying
the u.s. intelligence intelligence agency two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam jain here , and on this account , were a shortage of toilet dollars , when it was frozen .
mr. aboriginal itself is on free feet , the psycho is unknown .
and i &apos;m going to argue that today , it &apos;s more likely that we &apos;re going to be victims of a baby &apos;s disease as a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be just worse .
in the future , most crimes are going to play online .
the second largest world we can see today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something -- protests , a belief , or their audience .
groups like anonymous are about the last 12 months , and they have become a little bit of the world &apos;s field on the field of the world .
so these are the three main points : criminals , which are the money of money , like anonymous , which is doing resistance , but the last group are nations , governments who lead the attacks .
there are cases of how the most important .
it shows a great , which is what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
and the netherlands is a key of the netherlands -- or it was it .
in the last fall , it had to be the rebel butt , because it was hacked .
somebody was hacked , and they had the system to make a hack .
and last week in a meeting with dutch , i hired one of the senior people who asked the question whether he could be able to get it for possible , that because of the most powerful people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how do people die in the episode of a wii ?
so , the math is a computer game .
they sell the food team .
what do you do with a little bit of power ?
now , a certificate , you need a website with a computer camera with your power of service , for example , to be adventurous .
now we all use , or many of us , wiser or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly common in the states like iran , where dissidents is , where the local government is not in their conversation , and they know that they can be
but you can do it in a foreign foreign .
and it &apos;s a fool of arithmetic and fake .
and that &apos;s what happens in the case of the world &apos;s brain .
how about the arab spring and the things that are happening in egypt ?
now , in egypt , the emperor of the egyptian in april 2011 , the egyptian headquarters , and they found a lot of records .
in these records , a folder was called &quot; the &quot; aw . &quot;
and in this folder , notes of a local community were in the palestinian community , who sold a few programs in the egyptian government , which they were -- in very large frame -- all communication of egyptians could capture .
they had sold this program for reebok , and they sold the egyptian government .
the most important thing is right here .
so western governments are providing totalitarian governments with the food system that can take their own citizens .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany just a few weeks ago , a couple of weeks ago , that was used by the german , which was used by german , who was used by german , to make their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to grow in a drug plant , you &apos;ll be pretty much more secure .
but today we are far beyond it .
they tap their internet connection .
they use tools like the most important to make their computer with a tomato tomato system that allows them to monitor their entire communications , their own , the foreign bombsight , to collect their forefathers .
so if we &apos;re going to think about these things , the obvious answer of people , the obvious answer of people : &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not me because i &apos;m a good citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i don &apos;t hide . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and while we &apos;re today , in 2011 , our governments like trust , we &apos;re not going to be able to be able to be emitted forever .
and we trust , trust , we &apos;re blind to any future government , a government that we may have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we need to do with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the internet .
the first time , the first time , the holidays were made and a simple idea : modules from cement with a given set of land that fit .
so , the most quickly was the most quickly of the most quickly possible in the world .
they put us in the position to build things that were bigger than we , buildings , bridges , a stone after the other .
essentially , the most important thing was to the block of our time .
almost hundreds of years later , in 1947 , lego came out with this .
it &apos;s called the &quot; automatically scientific stone . &quot;
and within a few years , lego moved into every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones have been produced , or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for all .
lego basically has the most profound , the building building the world , and it made a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the same year at the bell labs , the next revolution was announced , the next building building .
the transistor was a little bit of a little bit of a sudden that was static to us from a world of static , and it was all interactive to a world in which it was interactive .
how the most important thing is to build us the transistor much more , more complex , more complex , a stone after the other .
but there &apos;s a little bit of a sudden , the transistor was just for experts .
i personally accept that , that the building system is our time for experts , and therefore i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was the media lab and i started exploring this idea of how to make the engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started to develop a lot of research .
let me show you how you work .
so , the electronic modules are electronic modules that have specific function .
they &apos;re a little bit of the light , light , clay , engine and sensor .
and the best thing about it is they connect with magnets .
they can &apos;t put them around the way wrong .
the stones are the wooden stones .
green is a copy , blue is electricity , pink is tissue , and orange is wires .
so everything you need to do is connect a blue and a green one , and you can build very quickly more quickly .
they add a blue one of the green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch between it and so you made a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
take the switch out to take a heat bottle , which is here , and they &apos;ve made a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
add this kind of thing to a extra effect , and they &apos;ve made a nuclear change .
i &apos;m going to stop that .
beyond the simple play , it &apos;s actually quite powerful .
instead of having to code , you have to program , or you have to have a little bit of your pleasure , intuitive gestures , to code .
so to slow up the arm , or slow down , just turn it on this button and it makes the momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind the internet is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world in a small rock .
lights , sound , sound , motors -- everything should be available .
we &apos;ve spread out of kids , and they &apos;re looking at it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is how they start to understand the electronics that they &apos;re in the day-to-day life and they don &apos;t learn to learn in school .
like , for example , a design machine , or why the doors of the road , or the other , the doors on touch .
we also brought the food team to the rescue .
so , for example , we had designers with no experience in electronic things that started playing with the material as material .
here we see , with the water , paper and water bottles , like the sun &apos;s ...
a few weeks ago , we got to risd and gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they told them , &quot; what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a more powerful piece of project .
but wait , this is really my favorite , really , my favorite .
it &apos;s a syllabary from play-doh that &apos;s afraid of the darkness .
for those of you , it was a more material , electronics was just another material .
and we want to make this material available for all available .
so , the open source is open source .
you can go to the website , all the most cosmopolitan download and make them .
we want to be the creators of the creators who encourage the inventors , because the world , the contributors we live in , is the kind of interactive world .
so , pull on and start making them .
thank you .
