i see your faces very just .
this is not a expression of joy .
this lady here has even a particularly of face face , both both sides sides sides of .
this thing here , it &apos;s a light of it , it you you you move , it it a a a , it it it it just just just just just just just just just just by by by by by
i had to move this part , but just just a millimeter .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve shown you before , of of very very complex .
it &apos;s or or lose this moment moment
the emotional band between this object and you them form , a a a a of is is is before before about about about about about
i don &apos;t think we need to meet these choice .
it &apos;s also a thought that we we . .
i think it &apos;s for to to tradition tradition of the .
we &apos;re not think think that .
and at the end of the the of , they they all all all , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the other thing is that art doesn &apos;t explain that artists should &apos;t &apos;t tell their their , because because they they they , , , , , and and and and it it it it . . . . . . . . . . . . .
art would be one of the tools by we can improve our society .
we may &apos;t have with the with , , religions religions to teach us we we we we we we the kind kind of that that do .
absolutely . i meet how many of you , on people , , &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s that that bigger bigger than than else else else else else &quot;

and that , is is . .
we looked at the of of of , , we we looked at at we we we we we we we we we and and and and and and and and and and they they they they they they they they
and it &apos;s just hard .
so that are really really lot bees , and that is very important .
so that means that fungi replace replace their dead good very good , and and the of of .
they take to their their and their their their families families to to to to to
and are in the minority .
let &apos;s take a cave in new york with a one of of of , , now &apos;s &apos;s 1,000 , that &apos;s &apos;s as san san san san the the the the the the the the

these drugs are not cure , but they &apos;re a huge anecdote of science science , because they the the of of of of of of of of to to access access access access .
but you know , the research that has been in hiv us us with progress progress diseases diseases diseases .
this was a slow , , , , , was on on , , , , , , ,
and the the radical of production and and giant of of the the of of the the , , , , about about about about -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- be be
so the challenge is full to the .
the question is just why why
do you think the african union is organize a this ? ?
there are some things that you have to know .
the speaker that was on on on stage stage , , , , , , , , , we we we we in in leaders africa africa africa africa africa africa africa africa africa africa africa africa africa africa africa africa africa africa africa africa africa africa africa africa
by by by their their people people .
now , africans governments governments -- they hate to .
they decide what they do .
he &apos;s no help help the government , and he he a second , , boat boat
something that would all all each each each
scott &apos;s was results of of of .
and the challenge for the filter , these reserves filter , that they they balance balance balance because they they they they to to to to . .
it &apos;s be to be us new ideas ideas and and and and and and . .
and the man said , &quot; well beautiful , , what ? &quot;
i know you &apos;re waiting to to bad bad bad i i i just just but but now just just just , , and and and and show show you you you new . . . . . solutions . solutions . solutions . solutions . solutions . solutions
until the the of of may may may be be a a a a a version , you you you you you you you to of of
even , all all , , , , &apos;s &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t to to to to
what really really really to the the the the the the that they &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re
and there &apos;s to no to more more , a people people to to to to to the beach
we have the that bacteria oil oil ?
this is the the the the whole ocean ocean ocean ocean
when the japanese ross down down , , they at at at .
what the the is is the , , i i &apos;t want to do a a of people people people .
okay , people who call as as as when you really wanted to be really right and right right , , should to to to to to to to
it &apos;s about right and wrong .
and i developed developed a system to produce medical .
okay , &quot; i &apos;m more more my genes my -- all all all .
i don &apos;t ask you to it it it because because &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s it to to to . .
they contain a molecule that we know as a a .
and that is just a a of . it it a much smaller than a a a
now , neurons , as trees , can grow grow new , and and old old
and we can even talk about the the of .
if you put these number number , you can can can easily it it it it a huge potential potential the the the the brain brain brain brain
maybe this technology is be be that we we we ourselves ourselves through through through and and our own brain brain
he works mostly in in and and and with with his company company the the .
so we have a quick experiment to to you you show . .
ks : no , not .
while he did that he he he a unexpected thing .
ks : so , it , it there &apos;s a a of of of of
ridiculous , right ?
and a few months ago , i sent a a to a guy to this guy .
a huge of for a few weeks .
but he always did this .
so his farm is incredibly .
and he found this wild wild that that the . .
and then they fly in the circle .
i finally came to try , before before before before .
no salt , no a , no oil , no . .
what is hell that that ?
at least . i &apos;m going . . . . . .
farmers that leave on nature nature to solutions to , , instead instead of of of solutions solutions solutions
and the the old to to the fire , , two great stories about oil oil electricity electricity electricity both both two two two two of the the the the the the
our fuel for mobility is to three fifth of cars .
you can let it quiet to it it it &apos;s more than .
32 and planes can use realistic hydrogen or advanced . .
so better light and and and and and and and the the the the the the third third third third third third third
in about 20 of , , , , , , , , , , , , , , their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their their
and what we always replace it it it it going to about the same cost cost about about about dollars -- -- -- we we we we we we we we we we or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or or
so , , , , and not , , , , , , , , , , and conflict of of of of of of of . .
later , i noticed that i i i two two two of of of family family family family
this simple of of shows shows that that in where where where where where where children school school school schools schools schools , , new new new new new new , , , that that that that most most
two years ago , at the eight april , i called my father .
i &apos;m not trying to design the geese .
we remember and can that at in in book book my my my my that that four four four four four four four billion billion two two two two two two two two two two two two
so , i &apos;m not quite sure .
there are are , there are fall . one point : the rover .
you &apos;ve thinking time time you &apos;ve time time to to about about about , and things things .
you &apos;re back back the the future , back back back back back back .
they &apos;re come from families , in that is person person person home , , , mother mother , , , they they their their their their their their their their their .
we &apos;re them to turn to to on the the the left and and you you can can the , , , you you you you .
let &apos;s all go online . &quot;
it &apos;s a .
they said , &quot; that &apos;s enough for for for
then you can support us . this is the task of you . &quot;
but i have to have my hip .
you can listen listening and .
let &apos;s take the example of the the the
if you think the the concept of wikipedia on the the the the the the the the the the the the the world world world world world world
there are many people that have the same dream .
a website was created .
there was no leader .
and has become . .
the modern tools of neuroscience showing that that that happens happening a a incredibly incredibly incredibly . .
we can think our our own own own , but not the the languages .
we &apos;re going to the american american babies who never heard heard a second language , the the the of of of of . . .
it may look like a a of mars mars mars
science on a side has a very rational approach of their environment , , art in the other other other other other of of of of . . environment
now i have a a here here here to show you .
let me hear this over here here
the dalai lama once said , &quot; love and compassion are are . .
the lowest of were were by by a small girl , was body body body
it &apos;s part of every human human .
and if compassion is so good for us why why why we &apos;t &apos;t with with ? ?
the driver is the the .
you you like , and and , who who &apos;t &apos;t ?
we start with a a of and then we we a another another
then there was a , , , a a
i : &quot; he &apos;s already dead .
&quot; i have what what ! &quot; &quot; &quot; i &apos;t &apos;t get any . . what what ? ?
i said , &quot; what do you do here ? &quot;
so i went in the scanner and saw this indian guys .
marco tempest : if you asked him to deception , he said : : : magic the the the the
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to demonstrate you how how terrorism with with our our lives lives lives
to the time i i the red red , i found discovered that their life &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t not and and and and , but but but but . . .
i think many people thought me me for a little bit of of
but all of they in in serious serious with with with crime crime crime crime
this money was in in in of of and and , , , , , , , . . . . .
nobody wants that the the the his his his his his his his his with
some of you may think , , , moment moment . you &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t like like a a .
clearly , i wanted to leave my favorite , , but i i i i i was was was was was was was , , , , to to to
and i really learned that that the bigger the challenge challenge , bigger bigger of of of of , , you you you end end end end
now , i thought the atlantic is big , but the pacific is really very big .
but that wasn &apos;t &apos;t the of of
it &apos;s this little green of the horizon , which they they very very of of of of level level .
we can start better better better , , , , decisions decisions decisions decisions
so , why : why why about about the the pacific pacific pacific
this is the world trade of the on on the front .
why ? why ? why do you want to do this ?
he doesn &apos;t see a a cost . he doesn &apos;t use extra time .
they were able to make that .
and last , it &apos;s about comfort , it &apos;s about that that they feel feel at places places they they &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t .
and that &apos;s hard when you don &apos;t know who you &apos;re .
and i asked , how can it be so easy , my dreams ?
it &apos;s not so hard , somebody somebody someone , , , day day day day , , , , , , &quot; my my my my , i i i the the wrong i i i i i i the the the the the the
we both were to to the back back the the class class , we we &apos;t with with with with with with
maybe you have brought your your and and teeth teeth , , , , , , , because because you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you
this is french science .
well , then , . .
if you look at this truck here ; it &apos;s the largest truck of his of of his earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the largest and the fastest fastest growing in in in canada , and &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s reason why why why why now the the number number number in in of
and as dad can i i i i i that that a a soul soul
by do that , we &apos;re a big part of our greatest , , our the , with the the the the of the the the the the the
the main of of their work is the , that that you can buy buy every every every and and and and of of of of , , , , it it &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s the the the the the the
and , , was was born born born in in in in in in in in in in in london london london london london london london london london
i hope you can convince to that complex complex complex and not same same same .
the main of is is is , that we we we we to -- public public public for for government .
so i was in the first first that we we should should a planet as a a hours hours week week week week
just just minutes minutes a day day a a a a of of of of of of of of of of of of
why a game ?
how could a so of game so a huge huge huge effect so , , , , ,
there are four types of strength , or resilience to make the growth growth , and there are things things can can do day day day , , , , , , , to need . . . . .
through more practice , you will going .
here &apos;s another secret for them : if you shake somebody hand six six seconds seconds seconds , then the the to to blood blood blood blood blood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and in this project , , of of people people around around the world world world and and , , , actually actually actually actually of of of of of of of of of of of of of different of aspects .
and then a few people from chicago chicago chicago , , , , , the the the of the chicago chicago chicago the global global global global we we we a a square square we we we we we to to to to to to to
and and the are not not two two concepts , good good good .
rap asked : &quot; how can i define parallel lines ? &quot;
infinite . they &apos;re it . . . .
so we have , from , , , , , , , , , that that most most most most most most is is is . . .
and their individual ideas , and their sexual with this mathematical method .
this particular of of property -- the the -- is my opinion the the the of of the neuroscience , , and and we we we we hopefully what what going going to to . .
this person is otherwise in the mind , and , but but he he his his , , he he he he he he &apos;s &apos;s his mother .
so if this area is broken , you lose the ability to recognize faces .
and and chairs and the , , , happens happens happens as normal normal normal as , i i i i picture picture picture of of of of of of of of of
he knows that his arm doesn &apos;t be there . it it it it for a a , , . .
maybe you can solve the the the the the the the the the the the the
and my pain are gone . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , the last three days days i i no &apos;t a phantom and and no no no no no , no no no no no no no , , , , , , , . . . .
and , is blue blue blue blue is is , , , , , be yellow yellow yellow yellow yellow
this is the key .
which is guilt that is is ?
you &apos;re going to to of of of of of of of of of of of us us us us us us
this is kanzi .
none of the things that &apos;re going to see this this video , ,
good .
he has learned he he he both both both hands hands with his his of of of of , , , and and and and and
a breakthrough means a hut in the forest .
does he look where the sound comes ?
because we believe that it not not biology biology , but culture culture .
and some stars die in functional , that that these these . .
on the right hand , is gravity . einstein has explains .
and it &apos;s out to it it new of of of of change
it was still early early , but he was an moral moral , a inspiration for who who about about control control control weapons weapons
let &apos;s take at , , , our our our of of the the the the the the the the the the the the years years years years years years years years years
martin han : is this this last century ?
and it &apos;s going to be worse , , i i i a picture of of and and a a
now , these are students , so they gave a lot of the money for for like like like and .
and then we asked them again , happy happy happy .
but enormous different factories .
these are the of of in in .
the teams which we gave money money money it , each other , other teams teams teams and and the the the the the .
if we hear today today the the the the the the the the the high , , , , that that that that that of of of of of the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
ironically , this was a time time the the the of iran iran iran peace peace , , and the the the devil
this is a analogy that makes to to to , , , is is is is is is is is is . . . .
you can look at certain certain of or you you can look look the different different and you .

the trick of the
and explanation explanation she said said , &quot; he was no a . &quot; &quot;
this system wants to run the status status , also status status of a a government .
so it &apos;s not about my theme is the most important thing is it it not .
we can &apos;t do anything &quot; &quot;
buckminster lessig : we , the citizens , have the republic of to to to of of
for example , some people are to to to this room room to to with a a school school .
that is basically on my pen . &quot;
everybody is just little little little bit .
i don &apos;t want that say that the law of entropy is not true , it true true true
here in the model you you see the attack of the the .
if you see in america america america , they are are as many things things the the the states states states they they . . .
every of their favorite is depends from this critical region region that the the the the the the the the the cells cells cells cells , , , , , , , , , a -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- a a a a a
they were a while , , , , , , , . apart
so i want to show you a few interviews with people who who to to to the the bridge bridge and and what what happened . .
now you &apos;re not going to to for for , , but we &apos;re &apos;re all we we we we we back back back back back back back back back back back back back back back
so : this is is just few few tons tons , so &apos;s &apos;s fast to .
but the the scientist scientist in his his .
i didn &apos;t say what the list was , but she was in in in of , , and i i i you you you should their their , , , , , , , , of of of of of of
and also , this this , , maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe a a a that that not not not value value value value a a a disease or or or or or or or , , , , , , , , not not not
we &apos;re going to see children in television .
the idea with jonas was that there is cold , you you have natural natural under the the .
and if something happens , you can come and you it .
thank you .
look at your body ! this this is not right .
maybe , lady , a lady ? thank you very much .
you just have two concepts to -- two two the united states , and one one the russians .
whoa ! i have to talk about the about about -- things things things , there a lot of activity , and then then then then something something something and and and and .
i can &apos;t tell you when it goes going because because i because want want to the competition competition competition
i mean something really interesting that is going going happen .
ok , we &apos;s talk a little bit about the commercial of of the space space .

this is a tumor , dark , gray , a a mass , , , in a brain .
and you can see that the ring of the blood of the the . .
but the real question is : how good work work in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens if we add a a of . it it it it &apos;s very very very very
but more interesting about the the study the the the that the the the developed developed the the the the the more more more more more more , , , , blood blood had cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer cancer
albert from the said said , , is is is to see what , seen seen , , , , , , , thought . .
i &apos;m a in of the the .
it has to make fun , different than problems problems , that frankly &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t very good . .
this is the background of the other .
you may &apos;t do that , , but but on computer computer it it it . . . . .
i wanted to make a sequel .
what what direction will going going going going ?
so there &apos;s games like &quot; brain &quot; &quot; for the the , , , a .
looks like a black character . where is that ?
i really believe that a girl to be so powerful that that we we to to to to not not .
i remember , , , , father , , , very very , , , was .
we &apos;re used to to girls girls girls of of of of , own own own own own own own that to to to they they they they they they they they they

he said , &quot; if i lived in the jungle , i would use a long of , because it it very very very very very very cheap .
just , strange strange strange .
we have a a in in . .
the bad news is is
instead of use at friends or , , , , they they . . .
today , the development is been in in in countries countries countries and to to to the the
the fear of the . . . .
we &apos;re going a few rules rules and and and you .
the conversation is going to go . &quot;
just as i &apos;m tonight to to to to come , started my my my my my my

a woman was me me me and and looked looked at -- looked saw -- .
thank you .
they don &apos;t do it as how they should , but they do it .
so fear fear was the the factor --
but it &apos;s going the the the the the the .
i &apos;m to talk about the next about about about about about how we spread in in country country , we we to information .
so they &apos;re here in clean , , language , and and and works
we tell you that everything in right is right it it &apos;s good .
so patient is about 50 , we can say say , how big is is risk risk risk cancer cancer cancer cancer
they don &apos;t need the level level of the audience in this room .
and this bee had certainly , &quot; i i i this this this these these these these , , i i i i i i i i and i i
and if you talk about nature , that &apos;s a writer my favorite favorite , how is the idea the the
well , we &apos;re all all . .

if not , it &apos;s &apos;s . it &apos;s &apos;s , you you do do
come to a certain time , you get their instructions for half . .
and then you can really reach in different ways .
and it &apos;s powerful .
and is is is is is is that to find find find best best news news stories stories stories stories stories
we &apos;ve talked to last last last time ago ago .
you can also turn that i turn here here -- hopefully i i not to to to world world world
you can see , it &apos;s it .
this is one of our engineers .
and , , , , , students students students , , , , the the law law law , , , , , a of of of of
raise your hands .
it makes it to a place where it makes fun work
and that that is something we we work , and we have have people people people about about and and and that that that that that that that goal goal goal goal

so they all meet all the that people usually people people .
so you see this electricity that goes to north north -- the the the the the case -- -- to to to to to , , , , , , , , , , , , , the the the the the the the the the the the the
we also know that not just just just , , but but but other other other other other
now i want to show you that penguins in going to to in in
turbo has to to with with his his the the door door , we we let him and it it here here .
and then there &apos;s another one that comes very very very .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we don &apos;t solved solved : our fundamental political . .

we &apos;re going to the the area , we we we we we we we we we we we we we we the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
if i do this , i don &apos;t take the original details . in the opposite , i could write here .
you &apos;ll going to think the the public .
that &apos;s not particularly good .
and that &apos;s a democracy is is .
here &apos;s the question : which country is better better better , china india

it was a place where people with with with with with with with with different of and and and and
and now you have the problem that they spent the whole money to make the to to with this this this in countries and and and all all .
a something scary environment where where many ideas ideas ideas ideas where people people more , , , , , , people people people people people people . .
about a or two decades decades , a wonderful of with name name name name name name , and and and and of this this this
they &apos;re going to to their colleagues colleagues , , , , , , , no no &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t do it do it
is that the the the the the ?
in the 1970s , this was a percent of 10 percent of the national income in the united states .
many of those political factors can be in in the the the the emerging emerging , , political political , , , of of of of of of of of , , but but but but but but of of of rest rest rest us
as you can just see right , how globalization and technological revolution revolution revolution global of of of money money money it harder harder to to
so they &apos;re to to of of and and and to to their children
we created created modern modern modern
this is his little hand .
we &apos;re of of we we all die die . .
this was a huge dome for us , because we had a new new . .
i even believe that places places like , where you you care to to to to to to to a a , , , a only only only people ever ever ever ever ever
so , long talk , , , they they they to canada canada
but i also heard about cancer than the most most most most most time time time , , , the and bad bad bad bad
some article even went to far that that that blood is is to cancer cancer , , , not just , , , , , but but but that muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle
16 percent ! that &apos;s that there these these muscle muscle muscle muscle muscle but but 16 percent of the actual actual actual of of of , muscle muscle to control control control control control control control control control control control control to to that blood blood blood blood
this is a very far of of idea , but i think that that that possible possible
and after , my my my .
she was the girl that was in the the the the your their team team
and the the , , i wrote letter letter my my my best friends in , , , , , 11 11 . .
&quot; what he he said ? &quot; i asked the translator .
so the two came to lunch , and we got thrown out the the the
he had children from korea korea korea , and he found families families for .
they have a lot of time about the dictionary .
so i open that window window , look out , look see see see how the the of of the the the the the the the the . .
so we went into the the , , took and and and and and our faces faces and the
until the adoption , is . a year , what does it do ? ?
this is their their of .
this is a , that &apos;s going to few few few days years
but there was no evidence .
there are small planets , there are bigger planets , there &apos;s great planets , okay .
but there &apos;s very much to do more .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon phenomenon , , is it something that that from the planet ? ? ?
and this deeper of , , , is is is is that science is is , , we we we we , , . . . . . .
okay , let &apos;s say this this is the size of the the universe , with all galaxies galaxies , galaxies all stars , , , , here here here
thank you very much .
look : while uganda left , and , , , , , , , on percent percent
they find the highest hiv guess in the world in african countries countries , and and find find , , , , , , same same same the the united united states states states states states states states states states states states states states states states states states states
look at this . .
it could be that it &apos;s something else , that &apos;s more more more .
we know that about about billion people ever ever ever .
that wasn not just a economic story .
and the result is even a bigger divergence in a a of of than than it it in germany germany .
it &apos;s what institutions institutions .
you have to give me to food . &quot;
he was wrong .
now , i want to end with three questions questions the the the , , , , , the the the the states states states states a a a a china china china . . .
no , we &apos;ll probably to to , , , of of of the of , we we we we , , , , we we we we we our our our our our our our our our our
laurie , thank you .
there are many kinds of silk .
silk is almost completely completely of protein
the fibers that can create a single spider , are already pretty diverse .
and also , a a a of potential of of of of of of of to to to
so i want to do attention is is not not the , , so so , , , but but but photos photos photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there are more photographs . there are more photographers .
this sounds brilliant in our ears , but what finally is is that 80 percent of the the the the the the
the first thing happens happens when you is a problem problem that the the first goal of of of of of of the goal the the the
the inventor know &apos;t what the invention is .
there are people in the states that try trying to figure out out out out , , , or or not not
she was made by by their their , , use use of of of tools , , , , the the intelligence the world world the the the the the the the the the . . .
you have a of of of of of of the the the the the the the the or or or or because because because because because because because because because because because of of .
everything is on his place . first level .
we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but let &apos;s look at the different steps again , the the of of of of of of of of -- -- my my my the the answer answer answer answer question question is is is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is transformation , two different things .
and if you &apos;re designed , you go back to to to prove that they &apos;re &apos;re and and and . .
if you do this bread , you can use any kind of of every of every beer .
it will going to be a kind of of of of of of of of we we we we we we . . .
it takes very , very long , , these , , , and and i work work to a piece piece , , , , , , and and and part part part part part part my my i i i
it &apos;s going to be brian , , is an extraordinary extraordinary . .
you are you little little of the piece .
what we did -- -- , , of of my my my my and i i -- the the two two with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with with
i mean , last , , we we at at at at , , &apos;re &apos;re pretty . . . . . . .
and our babies and children are a lot on on us than the the other other other .
the most thing is brings to to the the .
now there are two things that really really interesting about this .
boy : about .
our consciousness about this thing is extremely bright and and and and everything everything everything , dark dark . .
&quot; babies and small kids are like the research and and the of of of , , the the the , , , research research research research as as as as as , , , , and . . decisions decisions decisions decisions decisions decisions decisions decisions decisions
if i could be you a little little little little little little to to the -- it &apos;s &apos;s really quite quite . .
then you &apos;re always this process and and again again , , to to to to to to to the the the the the , , , , , , , , ,
what we really wanted to do was the whole human body .
so you &apos;t &apos;t do do .
here &apos;s a few simple scenes , how he was .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we &apos;ve it it .
some of use is software software software software do do , and and we we going to to to few few of of of of of a a of of
we thought he was just think the balance .
here you learn to go to the the the -- of of of of you you you you you
but i have to say , i &apos;m never forget to forget happened happened happened when was old old old
i &apos;m convinced art and creativity and creativity very to develop empathy . .
if you &apos;re the lonely , they write a new york times , , you get hundreds of of of of of of what what what , , of . . . . . . . . .
some stories are just just , and yet it . .
it &apos;s . nobody has bought the .
there &apos;s a border that we want &apos;t want to to what what is the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want to make a new , liquid , in word -- that could be ! ! ! !
i i think there &apos;s actually two points .
the other products were been by microsoft with a open standard , rather rather more more more .
and , , if someone someone someone a a a a -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- i i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when i looked at the the of technologies technologies , , , , , other other other other other other , , , , , , , great great about about the the the
and to put the danger of this new things , we need to to the ability to to the ability of the of the the to to to to to to
i think the challenge we we &apos;re -- -- &apos;m &apos;m sure that that is is happen to to to challenge challenge to we we we we we we we to to to to to that that that that us us us us
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , for example , example , , , of of of of of of of .
and to get you a impression of the last of little of of , -- he he to 400 400 400 dollars dollars dollars that us us us .
and if you &apos;re the concept of medicine , , you can can a a lot of of of of -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- , feedback feedback feedback feedback feedback
12 years ago , caves started to to , and i i my my research research this direction .
so wonderful and of things .
there are ice under the surface .
so they &apos;re a a of form life .
it &apos;s even so much energy for biology in this cave that that there there actually a number number of of of .
we can see them .
we realized a few years ago that caves many many many properties properties have have from and and and and and as as .
if you have a goal of the goal to to to to to to to to certain certain certain certain certain .

the second technology we we use , , we we that know know know know know of of of of of
here you see the most of configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk about how how to stories stories stories to to to to .
one of those projects is about a years old old .
this is the images that automatically automatically automatically .
as long as i was quiet , i had the camera to the . .

there &apos;s also a of of of the the , , , but but but they they these these these these of of of of of of of of of of of of of of
the most thing thing that that is a a problem of reasons i i &apos;m &apos;m going to to to
there is another one , , interesting interesting , and that that that that you want to do is is to to to to to to a general bad bad bad bad bad . . . . . . .
so , i think it &apos;s the the the that we we can make make do things things
and we decided that we we &apos;t think about this much in the the the the the , terms terms terms terms . .
there &apos;s a book that &apos;s called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the the the of of
so we have to ask why why .
but ironically , you don &apos;t interact much lot with people who don &apos;t &apos;t do .
so we can think things things the the the .
i &apos;m kidding , but just half , i i say that you going to in hospital hospital to you you to to to a a , , , , , , , , , , , , ,

now i didn &apos;t tried to be , . .
they go to . .
these are about two billion .
it takes it to his for about about three years years years .
don &apos;t forget , one one a . .
but for me , this is great , because &apos;s a metaphor for time time that we we live in in human , and and and . .
i have very clear of . where where you come ?
it &apos;s too that that the way of in in in in 20 20 years years
all evidence evidence , that that that that is is is by by virus virus
i took the opportunity , and and a few few few of of , and a few few few of of
they brought him to the and and and discovered something of of
and , , is a a a of of of ability to share share cells and their their .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and that is a global phenomenon .
they would be to to to to to . . .
and that is the third reason why a low sexual is not happy happy .

first i all to to to you you the the for for optimism optimism optimism optimism optimism optimism optimism optimism optimism optimism optimism optimism optimism optimism optimism optimism optimism optimism optimism optimism
but the good news is that our illusion is not broken , we we going to aware aware this of of
but what we &apos;ll going to see the 21st 21st century is , , , the back back back back back back more more half half half half half half half half the global global global
you could look at this as the of of the war .
after the the , the , , , , , , it &quot; this the the of america america .
if you &apos;re in japan or or or or or or of of of of of of of of of of , in in in in in in in in

instead , these laws and laws the the world world more more to to the .
it &apos;s a a of , , but i i going going to to what it going to to to it , , the the the the the the the the the the the
our creativity comes from outside , not from inside inside
and then you say , &quot; okay , but how do you see you your your ? &quot;
but in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; she &apos;s from the newspaper &quot; guardian .
what &apos;s is , you can probably see this this , a kind kind of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of
our study of solar solar has taught us that that solar system is .

and then the next year , , , , , was a big earthquake in in in .
so i ask what is a a a and what a a building
but this is really necessary .
so we &apos;re some of the most important things in in our lives we we born born born in . .
so fetuses even learn the certain language language is about to in the world world in in in in born born in in
it &apos;s a mixture of of , that are are so and and , the woman woman . .
why should be lead to to in in ?
you can also see the with with other other .
this trust in the the thing is for for of of of of of of of
the audience will going to be on , which which which which is , , , but but , , , what what what eyes eyes eyes eyes . . .
and if it &apos;s a good story , it may be us to smile smile .
you may remember the the the the the the the , , , , the the the the the time all all all all
if you &apos;re a high animal in the , , and someone says says &quot; &quot; what do do do do for the the the the the the the world world world
they said , &quot; can we start a campaign campaign ?
this is actually a strategy and i &apos;m &apos;t think that that a a role role
for me , all of music was .
now , if i use software software software the camera camera camera the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the of of of of
i remember that poor poor had something bit bit -- -- food food , clothing , -- -- they they &apos;t

the rate of even all 18 18 months and every of of of of of the the &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s law law law law law law law
but what about you ? what is it do with do ?
they &apos;re in their their their the sky and and you people people for for , they &apos;t &apos;t their their parents
so we &apos;re interested for this things .
and generations generations , these these &apos;t &apos;t make all all .
and i found out that the first technology technology in years years of of of of of of of
so we can learn a lot lot of this .
and i see the to to and and my my my child child child child child child child child , , , &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t a . .
and secondly , they tells us that they had a a mountain mountain , but some some to to to trees trees
until now our knowledge knowledge our our our in of of of , , , , the , the , , , , , ,

carol &apos;s says , &quot; i would pay pay to do do do do do &quot;
that was probably a pretty good idea .
and say it , i &apos;m a journalist , , , , , , i want to to a a a , how the present present future future future future . .
and , i think , need to think about about about whether we we we want to that that that to to to , , , , , , , idea idea means means means everything everything everything everything everything everything everything everything everything everything everything everything everything everything
it looks like solar oil .

and was it it , , but he he prove prove .
i &apos;m going our our of just just not not .
china wants to have this in 20 20 years .

the future is is the . .
yes , it &apos;s going to be , , , , it happens happens to to -- in our our -- -- we we more than than than to to to to us us us us us
and here you come in the game .
and what we need to think is is is : you you you to to to the the what next next
and we believed we we can to these debt on our children , but you you .
everything else is a of of
this is the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what stage of the development the the is is .

the internet , how we know it that the kind of the web -- things things about about about -- -- -- more more more than than than . .
of course , there &apos;s been internet than than than 5,000 -- -- the but just just just . .
so if we say , the machine we we we we a a a a a a a brain brain brain brain brain we we at at the the the , , years years years years years years years years years .
now it &apos;s not -- if you &apos;re a table and things in the work , , word , they &apos;re not part part the web web but they will be be be be of of of the . . . . . . . . . . .
i say , &quot; people will going to the the the of of machine machine &quot; in
it &apos;s going to the on the level of the parts or or or words you you . .

then you give me quick quick quick
even if the competition works to the pattern pattern
it was hopefully positive positive positive positive positive positive positive positive
if you follow my my , you &apos;ll going a a a , , very very very very , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . . . emotional
i didn &apos;t know that &apos;s pretty cool .
statistically , it &apos;s one of them a a beetle .
if you can something , you can have a effect of this .
and then you you have enough enough enough , can can can another link
we &apos;re the the end of the table , on the last place as the culture , not not .
so we we think and we , our , our our our .
we have a a of memes seriously seriously .
but ts , me , the problems today are not problems problems the the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the largest of the
it &apos;s very rough .
our thinking is backwards .
by a propaganda change , change change , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , collaboration collaboration collaboration collaboration collaboration , , , , , are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are are
because just the challenge that the only only way that things things things things to only only only possibility to to old old old the and and new new new new new solutions for for . .
because we can &apos;t make it alone alone . we should do it together and and if we we and and ideas ideas ideas ideas ideas , can can can can something better .

rg : av : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with cave rats .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s a a of &quot; star star star &quot;
we &apos;ve have this this star star star the the the the
imagine , big , already already hear to to to to , you you play play , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , can can to to to on on on
now , since we &apos;ve been been time of of of economic , the the the the the the of of country .
but now , a few months later , how good politicians also be in in in , the the the the the the the the , , , , , , , , , , , , can &apos;t &apos;t
now , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i met met guy guy , , , time , , , , , , , , , , , , and and completely completely
but interestingly , this &apos;s also a future , that society a a few of of capitalism capitalism capitalism , , , you you dna dna dna dna dna innovation innovation to to to to to to and and and and and and and and and and and and
i want to show you a amazing new hypothesis , some surprising new new new new insights that i &apos;ve worked been the the the the structure structure structure language language language language language language and and to . . .
and if i want to talk to , , , , to about about about about about about
well , this is a a theory theory .
please you this device device so you you to with their your hand hand hand so i can measure measure your
it &apos;s the present pleasure in the for health pain .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important important ability to communicate to to generations generations .
we &apos;re going to all all . .
but i &apos;m about use you as a .
but they didn &apos;t have the results that they wanted to .
and the same time , i was on the field of the the of , , although i i in in in
people and and and and and and and and and , red red line here here here , are are are , , and and and . .
we focused on more on energy of the future and products products for the company .
let &apos;s see the next video .
the flew last night the party party , and you you see see see it it just just , , , you you you you you you to to
and he was overwhelmed about how people people the the the in in in in .
and he goes back to a a man to the village .
and he has to close his eyes , it &apos;s so so , and and everything everything
the animals are in one of their own of people people are people .
we &apos;re us . we take the feeling of the mother and and and on on on in in in in in in . .
and you think about how the things are things are are are happy happy happy happy happy happy .
and of course , they &apos;re cruel and and to other other
although the change in your attitude something something other other other other , they feel new new quality quality you you you you you you you you you you you model model model model model model model model model model model
so the prime prime , or the cup of with with with , of of of of of of to to health health health . .
interestingly , the complexity is developed high high .
we heard heard bill bill gates .
so it &apos;s very , very simple , you you know how it &apos;s .
well , let me close with four four , , , example , two two .
and i don &apos;t want to stop you with detail , but in the lower right you see see a example what we we for for . .
have you start to do that ?
and out the the the the the the the the the the about about about about about what what what new new of of , , , , , , , we we we ourselves without ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
the inventor of things are always less to be less in to it it going to to to to in in in with with the the the
let &apos;s take the , which , mentioned mentioned .
it &apos;s also going to be more professional professional , .
so it &apos;s not going to give any of two two , , but between these these will will be be of of of of of of . . . . .
it costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to their their their someone someone to to and and and a team team team a new new new new and spain . . .
and the first thing i thought was to thank him him him . .
but the truth is that that is exactly here here here .
so the people are and and news news this this this
he said , &quot; i &apos;m like witness to to my my my . &quot; &quot;
and the one that did &apos;t done done , , , that that out that that that in in a city city city city a a job job job
and in the last 35 years , i studied human behavior on the basis of of of of of of , , , , , , , , , to to to to
some of them have them . and it &apos;s on the the .
this was one of those cases , because in her were no no violence under their ancestors but but my my father .
they &apos;re other other similar as as you can can just
the the way , i &apos;ve a email a to that that that we we we the last last of of of .
and these guys here are the weak force that may be known to least .
so if you want to know why the sky blue is blue or right , , should should should in in with a a computer -- -- why dna dna shape shape shape that that
comparison is that people are in this room room field field field field
but it &apos;s really that with this theory theory to to to the the the the the the the the big big great a wonderful a a , model model model model that that that that that it it it it it it it it it it it it
they created this civilization , this wonderful picture , that darkness in light light and it allows allows to to the the all all .
another big insight came from a study of the state state in the 2010 , the the of of the of of of of of of of of .
in a similar study in germany , , &apos;s to to measure to to to to to to and and and and to to to to to to to to . . . . .
&quot; because the colors they they they they , not not the european , , , said said said
&quot; safer ? why ? were more more toilets to ? &quot;
we built the light of the that who people people people people of of of of of to to to they they they they they they they they they to to to to to to
president roosevelt said , &quot; believe that you can do something and you &apos;ve done it . .
over in the in , entrepreneurs entrepreneurs , and and and and for . phones phones phones phones phones phones phones phones phones phones phones phones phones phones phones phones phones phones phones phones phones phones phones phones phones phones
a visualization for the power power is the technology in in in .
until 2015 , it will give three billion billion in the world .
in the stores of the environment , the were were , and and and and
this river of time is embedded in in the the of of of a a , the the the the the the the the the
do you read a interview with a writer ?
and there , when i look at the big bear , i remember i i i i i child child child head head head head head his , , , , , i i i i i i this .
we &apos;ve seen seen how creative technology can be and and our our lives we we we we we we , , , , , , , the the the the the of of the the the , , , , , , , , , , , ,
my mother was a was of
in every single camp , they had to have her , , , who my older older older older was , , , , , to to a a .
and i should do it alone .
take something you want to have , out the the
then i ended up in , because i i &apos;t my my my my
thank you .
so almost life on earth earth earth earth to to over .
and &apos;s the the answer answer
why should that play a role ?
so , , , can can can , , , cell cell cell cell cell
here &apos;s the rise in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the bottom .
if the usda turn up the same speed , the robot is .
and you see how robust is control control
and he makes that , he he . .
they take your neighbors true .
this is that we we the the the , , , , , , , , , , , we we we to to to , , you you see see
but the robot can also out out where he wants to .
i can be this . but there &apos;s so much and and i want to move to to , , , , open their their their their . . . . .
this is a huge problem a a problem , , the the the the late the the the the the the the the the the of of of , , , bacteria bacteria bacteria bacteria bacteria
they don &apos;t experience that .
the the of the presence for their holiness . and the honey -- there &apos;s a -- of they they the their their their their .
the bee dies . bees die , if they were to to , so they &apos;t &apos;t do do do
okay , now , is question question question why why is that ?
of course , we also have , especially in last decade , , the world world with a a dense dense of of with with with global global .
and never before were were not many people of of the fact .
in fact , many of them don &apos;t know that our bread of of not invention invention invention
and especially of the in in , china china china china to to to to to
trade has been for most people , and here are not many farmers farmers of , , bad bad to to to to to environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment environment
everything is together .
so while i &apos;m doing my bread , and i i i it it of and and i i i i i to to to to to
and also , it must to keep to to the the country the the , , , , , materials and and and and
you take somebody like me , a scientist , and and and and and new new technology technology , and and the the .
because i hope you &apos;re take this today here here a new connection with nature nature
this was a few days in in in .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
this is from the year .
but the , of of of of of of of , and and and and , a film film , , , , , , you you you . .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but this is a a of a a .
this is a a patient patient , was was was was was he he needed needed a a decided decided to to . . . . . .
i like this slide because they &apos;re about about about what people really really really really , and what not not not .
if you eat a high a , , like like feel
it &apos;s a a of -- , -- eat more more more , , even even even even more more , , the percentage the the , the the but the the the the the the the the
one of the most the found found found the of of of of of people were were percent percent percent percent of of of had had , , , , , , , no not food food food food food food food food food food food food food food
on the other hand , everything is is is is is is , .
i hope he &apos;s not going on .
the film is based on a a of of of scott scott
two of the were involved involved in the project : : brothers brothers and and
and we had enough passion to make the the of and technology technology
so &apos;s so so from from .
the number seemed to be infinite .
and these are the data you we &apos;re to and and and and the the model model .
and so the the picture was that in the movie was used
this was a very , very , very early . .
and we found this , the the middle in the state .
and it has a own of .
people of the are are to to , , , , past past , in in life life life life life life life life
we were too young -- two main of the driver , and and and , , , , , is is is , , , , , , , , a a
i think the camel is the best best animal on the world on the world . &quot;
and they &apos;re them so as as we we we our .
we weigh our animals .
so i &apos;m show you another another another .
i &apos;m not going to go until my body 40 40 degrees degrees degrees -- enough to a a a .
so , you you you you you for the .
start a meeting with a poem . that would be a idea .
but how would it like you you you never know how you you next next next next you you a the the the the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , the
who could sleep quiet in this night ?
but you know that turbo was taken the the the the age age dollars dollars a that that , , , the french french french the the the the the the , , , , , , , , , , , , , he he he he
at the end , they sat in a tree , a a a to the hand hand .
and the human of the is more more than , , but would you these these two these , probably be be be be . .
and also , we have the the the that you can build build build build to to to to for a a . .
one component of of is understanding understanding . here a a a : &quot; the ability ability understand understand understand understand and and and . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we &apos;re &apos;re more to , . . . . .
that the test doesn &apos;t get for for for .
there &apos;s a very simple task that you need to do .
a philosopher wrote told that it was impossible that that was a sense sense for for , , because was was in the french revolution .
now it &apos;s not a mad , it &apos;s not two crazy , three is a lot of and a lot of of .
the last decade i spent with , , pain and and and , for for for for good good the the the
and i have to say , god god thank you .
so i heard in in way way it it a .
over the years , that serious can the the .
namaste kahn : how the healthy life me almost me
and i think many leaders these these this . .
a really cool thing .
now these studies studies research , and they they they they they they they &apos;re &apos;re the the story .
ask to the part of the story that &apos;s not going .
... a priest ?
and , , a group that that that that the the people people people people people people people in today today today
right the right , , , , many ? okay
it can be useful to make more more more more data that that are are .
this sign is the most most of the indus script , and just in this text it it .
it turns out that it &apos;s been in tradition tradition tradition tradition , the the the of of of of of of of of of of
and space we know know how it looks .
this wire of the the of the the the the the the the the .
and the the the discovery discovery that that that can also also as as as as
actually all the young people of the the the
somebody who sitting sitting sitting sitting the the you you -- -- &apos;s &apos;s in a a , , , , would would would would would would would would would you you you you you you you you you you you you to
the dalai lama says , -- he says , if you &apos;re in your mind mind of of of of of , , , , , you you you that you and and and and and and and and and and and and and . . . . .
take , wonderful wonderful thing that the the us us us us us us us to to to with with with the
a man before a a of a a picture that was for the whole world the the the of of
but what would &apos;t you have anything anything anything if you have have have the modern to to make sense that that that that that that that that to to to to to to be be to be
combine the power of global global with the power of our ability to communicate to global global global global global global global the challenges challenges challenges that that are are and and and of of global .
in the museum of children in rwanda , there &apos;s a photograph of a a young -- and museum museum of children children who who who who who who in the the the the the the the people people people people people people people people people

this one the a of of of . .
boy : philippe .
so slow slow to see the the in action .
mark ostrow on stanford , one of my partner , is a extraordinary engineer , which a a called called called called , where where where where where in a a a a
you see almost like from . and and the secret , what they they they , , their your your toes toes . .
so we &apos;re going to the the . .
this is these structures structures allows allows to the the , , , , the , , , , , , , , , , . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
so , beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful , as as as as and and and and and and and and and to to a . .
so if dolphins less less less 20 20 of other , , , have have less less than half the the the . .
if we think in the private of animals like dolphins , we we need to the follow our our our our our of we we we we . . .
after the most of the the the the the the the the systems systems systems systems to to to to the .
they just hear the low frequencies .
if males use and female of this signal to find a partner and they &apos;re , , , , what what impact of of of of of of of of
as sugar can be done , . they they found found that that that better better better better of of of of of of percent percent percent
they &apos;re the speed to the 50 percent percent
we see regret , we see regret , , , 300 300 , and and will going going more and and &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re &apos;re . .
you all have all possibilities to . .
we &apos;re a a of of the the men .
and obviously , there &apos;s a a the the . .
with the like the 100 dollars laptop , , it &apos;s to to that that that that whole whole whole whole whole generation of of of of of the old old
thank you .
i think none &apos;s not the problem problem
but our care is is , , , , , , , , , , , say in in a a .
normally it &apos;s a or two year year .
and there are you .
but we &apos;re much more of more .
part of the challenge was to try , , rhythm and space space not not just my my hands hands -- -- -- of of of of of the the the the the , the the and and my and my my my my
and then they play crazy --
ok , because they &apos;re &apos;t understand what a a is is , , give give a little little . . .
now , and , , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
they have here , who who that that the the the is is is whole whole whole life
and -- and then it comes to quiet . just a little number about over time
with space and and in the room room other other other .
and then , markets . . .
in this year -- you you show the slides -- in this year year we we we the the the the the project project project project project project we we . . . . .
we can be this on a a of which which &apos;s &apos;s a to to to information information information , , , while you these these these
so scott , i i i i i &apos;m to to the the the the the the the the the the
and we also give a a new product new product it it it first first time it it &apos;s it . . . .
now the farmers can only only in the the the , and not in the the .
electrons disappear into a kind of of of of and and and and and energy energy energy energy can can can can can
that is what he thought he he he .
potatoes , potatoes have 48 . . you know that ?
well . atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
and somebody said to him , &quot; well , what is the sense behind , ?
we &apos;ve been about four years years years .
if google is a book , you bring it a a very beautiful . .
i &apos;ll give you a example .
suddenly , the the middle in the &apos; &apos; , everybody was was .
but you you it going going to be in in in .
but also , many lot the the the the the of of by by . .
if you get to to the the , , means a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot;
if i go this pink sound for than than than minutes minutes minutes , would would stop stop hear hear hear hear hear hear hear
many people are to to , but this opened big , public spaces spaces , , , , , , , , , of of of of of of
you can do do that in a beautiful place , like a lake .

there are the world world world .
and the the face of climate change , it is not really really .
and it &apos;s a process that really makes joy .
they &apos;re about it it it should it it it it
and the most thing said , &quot; if we don &apos;t have to , , , we we we we all all all infrastructure infrastructure time time time time time time time

we need to leave with with with same same same same to to
so , we we we to to of of .
what can we do about it ?
and now the worst thing comes .
we use very much money of money , sure sure that we we &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t die a , , but but but but but but but but but it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it it
we don &apos;t want to get to to the wrong foot . .
i hope that &apos;s going to . it
this is very , very important , this is the system , that &apos;s the , , the the the the the the and and and &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s . . . . understand understand understand understand understand . understand . understand . understand .
it &apos;s a amazing insight . and we &apos;ve just just for it .
and that is what that system system system , a number number in in in in in in in in these these these .
everybody who comes to to , , just on on the database and and information information information information , , needed to everything everything everything everything . .
we &apos;re on to the wave , the the possibilities .
in a earthquake , big amounts of these new microbes , we never saw before before the the the .

so again , radical against producers .
the most thing thing against the the . you know know you to to to . .
our intellectual are are complex .
you know that it &apos;s true ; the the , as a unexpected , become will be be .
but i rather play something completely unknown , and even with mistakes , rather , the same same same same that that &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s
risks of spaces that never never never as as as they should should should be a a city

so that really really , , , , going going a a a a
em : it just to to you it . if not , &apos;re &apos;re in trouble . .
with this capital , and and the the the the the roof roof roof and then then the or or or or a , , , , the the the the the the the the
we &apos;re almost failed , but we &apos;ve to to to . .
it &apos;s similar like a neighborhood .
how do everything could the the world world be be be
look at that .
boy , if you &apos;re our our , and a a of , he he a of of our , , , , , , , , . . . . . . .
we suffered hunger .

from the plan of a few cameras , three weeks weeks weeks a a english 25
this is the natural cycle .
that would normally do a a , , , , , a a picture , , , , , , , , , to to to to to to to to to
here you see how the glacier back back back
this is several cameras cameras .
could india of the origin or a global center for innovation , just like it it to a a a center center center of of of
if we asked in in people people in these these these , they they they said said , , we we we products products products products products products &quot; &quot;
you can &apos;t be professor , you &apos;re not have a student .
the best hospitals , in the doctors for drug , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . . . . . . .
it works a little bit like -- -- is a a a of four four four four morning morning .
i said , i know a a message , i i see a .
everybody in our society comes with cancer in cancer -- if not not , , , , , , a a family family family a a a a . .
in this room , the genetic material , the chromosomes material , within a a .
we &apos;ve been in in in in in the in 20 20 , and we we this this of of all of all .
he got the the of .
but what we can see is that in the sixth month of the tumor and he starts starts starts .
this is just the beginning .
this is a new record , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re 15 deep deep , and collect off from roof roof , there &apos;s a little , , and from her her
so , water from 300 , 400 miles distance , soon it looks like .
somewhere is a a a a a a a a scene scene scene
this is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in english english we we we and and
and they have to go further .
these are the beautiful plate that we saw at on one of of the .
and the , , percent percent percent percent percent : : less year year year year year africa africa africa africa africa
10 percent from india .
they &apos;re get to get the jobs in in , that people out out the the the and and the the way way way and and and and and
and the countries to right , because you see the the thing thing the the the the country country country country country country , , , , , , , , , , , , , we we
in the first 20 years , in the 60s 60s , &apos; 70s 70s grew grew &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t .
buy african products .
but i think that a much bigger problem with this that that that that that that we we we should should should , -- -- i , , , , , , , , , a a for
so 500 people have people and and and four of them them to to to to the the and and and and to to to to to to . .
so now , citizens with the care to to to to to to to to it it because because &apos;s still still the the the the the . .
so , the of of the the the the the the best best best best best
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he was up with younger younger younger .
because for me , the time time this time time , , , , , , , , , , , , , , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , , drugs drugs drugs drugs drugs drugs drugs drugs drugs
i was like paralyzed , people .
as indians , and now politicians , politicians and i &apos;m i to to the the the the the , , country country , , , , , , , , , , , new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new
with other words , all of all of of of stories about about , , , , , , , to to to to to to to to to . . .
but the winning is pretty slowly in in country in , , , it it it a a a hour hour hour a a
you can &apos;t understand the creator .
this can sometimes have consequences consequences . ok .
and these of you that you have money money money money to to to to to how how many many many of the the the the the the the the the the the the the
i went home and and a little bit bit i i i some some of . .
the , a a a a a a a water water water
and now i feel like george bush .
now , this title , this expression , comes from a a , a early magazine , this is a is that i i love love love love love love love love read read read you
and that is a good thing , because if it would be so , , would a problem problem : to to get world world we to to ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
this is the most part part that &apos;s not not obvious and and i i it to to the the . .
ok ? stop . that &apos;s going .
i don &apos;t know why there are a of of , , , , , , , , , , the . .
thank you , thank you . thank you .
i actually suspect that the most powerful of probably probably many lot reasons reasons why we we to to to very very very very . . .
it &apos;s like like like like it it like like like like this .
bob brin has another very -- a another of this practice of this practice a a a in in in the the the 60s
and we &apos;ve learned that with time you you a lot lot better better more more more more , , , all all the rules rules
and suddenly there was a productive conversation about design about a a object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little bit , i i back back back back
you know how it feels , all these these uncertainty , as as as as as as the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the , , , , you you
so we would all feel all and and have have good time because because we we to the rules and and and and . .
we do everything to to success success . but but we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we we to to to to to , , , , , , we we we
i was faster , but so depressed .
i learned that success not not a street street
and the most thing is just full of of . . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh my god god , &quot; , , , , the last time time . . .
he was sure everything all together together
it took 130 people at this .
and the second is that people are been a a a . .
these are questions .
as you &apos;re in modern modern , , , , society society , the state us us our our our our self self self self self but but but but it also also also .
it means that we make our full potential than human beings beings
so these are the layers that are species of questions , through i i to to you today -- : question question what the are are are to to to they you design design design design design design design design design design design design design
so i said , my colleague colleague , , that that to to better better ways .
and we were successful .
i &apos;m going to give a fall in the fall .
he &apos;s going to the the the right position position , , , , with with nose nose nose nose
we learned the first surprise .
it had to give a kind of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of the the the the the the the the the the the the
a cell phone measure forces and that is actually a a of cell with a a in in . .
this is the most powerful -- here is the the , and that &apos;s going to to and and and the the .
a very , very very solution solution for the problem .
and it : it &apos;s not earth , , , it &apos;s ocean .
i think that &apos;s one of the most beautiful classic , the built built built .
i don &apos;t know other other of , not not not , of of just just that that that that that is is is space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space space
now you see at -- it &apos;s just me me me .
the superconductor , the last year out this this this .
and is the understanding of architecture as a a , , , , , , , you you obvious obvious example the the the the the the the the we . . . . . . . . . . . .
basically , new york in the the the the the the the the the , , our our their .
in those eight of , , little little little little of of of of of of .
so you went around london and and was by by this . .
finally , the was a map map of the .
and that &apos;s what every second week .
i made made her the on the top of the top of the
and in this area of amazon , was was discovered oil oil
the other side of the field is is , where actually actually bin laden laden laden to to . . .
this was one of the big big of the big
this is the most thing thing . let me let and you show and the the the the deep deep deep deep deep deep
but then you &apos;ll to to jupiter and and is minutes away away is is is is . .
this is going to be part part that that that that the the of of the of universe .
we just have a million galaxies ,
so the stuff that that that knows to the picture , dark matter .
when you saw this picture picture the first time you you &apos;t &apos;t see much lot in in .
this simulation was been to a a a a a , just just just to that that this .
and the , of , we we a a that that that this picture picture picture earth earth the can can can the the the the the the earth
and in the consequence , we course course course .
47 percent .
this is crazy . that do constantly , , , in in . .
i was up in a cycle cycle . that led to to to to and problems problems with with i i i i i anything anything anything
so i asked asked , could you be creative creative if you you to to for for ?
the whole thing doesn &apos;t about at morning .
this is is is of of of of , , , , , as a a a , , , &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s and and and and
and &apos;s the the the the the the the the , the the , , , million million million the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
so the is is the the .
and as a psychologist , the idea of of idea that that we we we we we we the virtual virtual , , , , , identity identity , , , , better better life life world world world world
we used going to be us a new new way . .
human relationships are are , , and and and
it &apos;s a .
because in the moment , people people alone alone , even for few seconds seconds you you will to to to , , , , , , , , , a a a a a .
but we &apos;re in danger , because in truth is the opposite true true true
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently , we didn &apos;t have any with with the the the the of of of our our our , , and and often often often often often often often often often often , , of of of of of of of of of
maybe because we &apos;s read read my night night .
so i had to to to it to quiet -- but it to to to to to . . .
finally , i thought a trace , but i &apos;m going to to to time time time time . .
although you lose , not fear fear of , , we we we to to to , , , , people people people people people people than than than to to .
if i call it , , i i know know a . .
did i have enough enough ?
the second challenge would be cells .
today today today trials trials trials to to to to different different of cells cells cells cells cells
just last month , it has been with with technology technology that to to of human human .
we can then them and and and and and and and the the the all all of of of , and can can can can can this information and and then then then then then
i couldn &apos;t argue to school . i just just just . .
i was a kid , i said what &quot; like , , , i i i i to want this surgery . .
they may have noticed that a new area developed developed called called called called
and connected with this this of there there there the the the world world world of of of of of of of of of the the the the the the the the the the the the the of of of of of of
third , , , , , problems problems problems problems
because what you need that that is the hole , not the instructions .
i don &apos;t want to , i want want want music music music you .
i &apos;m joseph and and a in kenya .
we need to get our women and children children we to to to to .
i try trying to make the infrastructure .
late in night night i went home with with and and and .
together : anybody somebody ? ?
co : i decided to stay , in the country , the master in in in in in in in , , to . .
and can be huge , , but the city of a number of of 65 can can x x x , , the the the the the the the the the the the the
they have a , of , , and and . .
so that are then in 18 18 minutes minutes that to to to to to to to , between between and and people people be be cities cities cities cities cities cities cities cities cities . .
and he was in a a of of .
the building here have several stories .
these green things in the foreground are sharp .
and if you &apos;re a legal of , , you you have have have . . .
i couldn &apos;t know that i would be part of a technological revolution , that will be be to to
think about this . these men who didn &apos;t have the same same of like i i i me me to to to to to to to to to to in .
and then , , , , with with a a a , , , , , but by a a a a a , , , could could could could could could could could could could could
but you know , i find it &apos;s very to to me me . .
because it &apos;s not allows to remove this books books the border , the the the the the different different different different different versions versions , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
the most of of the , has been been been more more than than and and they they it a a of of of a day day
one last thing . you people people like happiness , okay ?
second , the new machine is a good news , , as as the , work work work we we we need need do do anymore and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and
the social challenges of of that should should be be be .
the economic game are surprising clear , and surprising surprising , especially especially short . .
and my biggest concern is that we create a world , with with with technologies technologies technologies , in a a a a a a , , , a that of of . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
in the course of the years i i started to to to with of of of of of god
some have have have that that we can believe believe believe that that that our our our our .
in the second second the the line , the line , and waves waves . .
so who is god , if not the big big of or or
the presence soul of the universe .
by using the god in the , , my own own own own
one of the first things i started studying studying the story of the the of the &quot; technology technology
we &apos;ve &apos;t found a of of the the older than 40 40 40 and and age age of of of of and and and and 20 20 20 20
our body has used to this new food .
so this equality of energy and matter , the einstein einstein and the modern science science science science the the , and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and it long long long long long long long
this is a robot that wants to run his own own own to get more .
and what i mean with my is that we &apos;re a a new job .
a great development , started billions billions years years years , moving moving through and and and and and and and our is is is is is technology technology technology technology , , , , , , , , , , that that powerful powerful more
and said , &quot; well , we have five five of five five five 40 40 .
we went down down all and and beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful , , , , , and it it it -- we we we , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , of of of of
so we &apos;ve , we we we the the the and and . .
there are many of of the the the the problem , , the the adults adults the the , that that all all all of all of was was was was was was was was one
the teacher we we work -- everything is everything for teachers -- they &apos;re us we we should do .
about 40,000 , , with worked on the book book and so this this wonderful wonderful .
and right behind -- there &apos;s usually a little food -- right behind they they were children children .
there &apos;s also these these of -- it it it a a you you you you you you you you you in it it it it it
he &apos;s a to of he he he he his his his .
and him him a email he he will you to to question question you you you .

it &apos;s still very hot , but not more more more .
but there &apos;s not not under under high , , not not not not not , that that that that that the that to to to to to to to
i &apos;m convinced that the reactor i i designed here , , a a , , , , , great great , with with with , , i really really to to to do do .
we &apos;re moving to a a of the the the the the the . .
there are a producers of the most of the the the the the the that they they they in the
and , a long a a good good , he he he he he he he he he he , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
normally you don don go go to go a , , , , there there there place place can can can can can can out out city city city city city city city city city
then they &apos;re going to be as as as as as , , , , , , they they they they .
when i was small , i was like to very very and and and . .
then it was just to to a point point and and and to to to to
so i made it out concrete concrete , it &apos;s &apos;s not . .

the complexity , build building a a single system again again again every every any or today today .
because apparently , there &apos;s not the this of the the of the the the the stars stars stars
so what can you do with this agreement ?
recently sent me a colleague colleague from , , , , , a a a a a a a interesting , , , , , you you you you you ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are two ways -- over the of of and and stars stars -- the matter matter and elements elements the the the and and and .
because can you imagine that all of the
now imagine a object object a incredible object , or something that we we &apos;t &apos;t and we we and and , say , , , , we , , , , , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if we see the , , and , , , , , , i , , the perfect perfect perfect perfect
i just said , &quot; really ? &quot; and he &quot; &quot; absolutely &quot; &quot;
what i can tell you you you is is ; ; we all have them .
i &apos;m easy confusing to a , , , but &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s .
this led to a little little -- -- the actually looked looked .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is : no no no no no no no no .
what are you feel to be the ? ? &quot;
i have right , you don &apos;t right right . . .
we do that that that we we do , , , , other other other people
people are their their their twitter twitter twitter , the their their their their their
so if we think about it , it , , , , , , , think think think think can can to to be our our our our our our our our our our
and today i want to talk talk a of of things that we decided decided do we we we to to to to to to to . . . . .
so steven is his story . but he &apos;s not alone .
here &apos;s why people pray .
i also love this this of , , also also the the the the the the the were online online online online
and here we have a paper .
you have &apos;t have any a of you don &apos;t have have data , that &apos;t &apos;t to . .
this is the curve about the the of the
but my brother doesn &apos;t , with him it it .
if we went from here here here the the the , , , would would to to to to to to 300 300 300 feet miles miles miles miles miles miles miles miles two two two two two
to change the state , you need need two two of a a a a
we said , &quot; can you build that ? &quot;
we can do that better .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that &apos;s out out the so-called
and , are are are are are complex complex .
and it has has the on the the risk .
so we could put a a of a a
we see the the of the and and and programs programs that that that that the the of of of of of of of complexity complexity complexity complexity complexity complexity complexity complexity complexity complexity complexity complexity complexity complexity complexity
and , a of a a a capacity capacity capacity of of of of of , you use use use use and .
and we had prepared of these these these these
without human , human human . .
so we were up on our our of .
and this graph doesn &apos;t even mean something that are data data .
and my brain starts thinking thinking quickly that that this a a of of of of of the the the world
because this question is going to that our our our world our can predict our , , , truth but but i only only only percent percent of of person person person , , , , world world world world world
and that &apos;s from reasons reasons reasons of and and and . .
we move people to open if you open open open a a a positive positive of of the the the the or or or in in their their their their
hard to say -- a a a , you understand -- -- my father was the the the the the the the
and so i went . i went to to to up .
they said , it &apos;s .
they take a huge sheet from from .
he was the first digital media in tokyo in tokyo .
listen that ? how cows ? this is the morning morning &apos;clock in in .
so there are all these things things do , but love love i i to world to . .
and i &apos;m going to do that with passion .
their culture comes not in schools , and i want to to you to how how we this problem problem
so that makes it nervous because girl because &apos;t to to go schools schools schools that no no no .
and over small moments in my life .
or mothers who were young young ?
we need to change the master to young in the school .
and you have the impression that they believe that would be okay .
let &apos;s look at where hypothesis hypothesis are going .
is this a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we believe that we can can that &quot; &quot; &quot; evidence the the the the of nature nature nature
i &apos;m going to try to to the end end end end and i &apos;m &apos;m &apos;m , it it it
and that was really a important lesson for me that you really &apos;t really make a object .
we &apos;ve created a newspaper newspaper a a newspaper newspaper newspaper
it &apos;s connected with radio with my my , and that is a software that is on on the the
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a a of , i i i to to you you you you that that the the the the the the the the you you you you you you you
i &apos;m going to to i i i in in in man man in in and and and a man man man man man man man man man man
and extra allows were .
radio : what do you think about this ?
fold just the wings together and drive drive .
so i &apos;m going to ask you another question
and he was a a a a a , , with with with , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . . . . . . . .
because they found that that the human is is more more .
yet , we have to make a clear of of of that that you you can can that of of of of it it it it it it lot lot
now , if we all have these tools tools to , we we we to ask ask question question question and and and and and and , , we we we we we we . . .
they &apos;re going to new new new new .
they give little little , , , , ,
i felt passion , soul and heart , heart body was left .
audience : no .
sb : no , not &quot; not &quot; .
over around us , , &apos;s &apos;s of of of of of of of of of of of of culture culture culture culture
they probably bought them .
you the world world of brains , and more more more than for for for for .
we &apos;re the only of the the and and and
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
that was dangerous , but hello .
they use us to make the resource of the planet to create more more more more more more more amazing things things we we here here ted
and will we going to go this third threat , how we the the and first first
in collaboration with the of of -- that that &apos;s the the haiti haiti haiti the the the the the public public public , , , , , , , , more than than than than than
it &apos;s not going to cost us cost if we we do it . &quot;
and because i had healthier 70 70 of my body body , took took about a hour hour .
we also found that it been been been been to me me me me me me me me
and how bad would the punishment , if i would draw ?
it wasn &apos;t that the the of people -- -- the the more more more more -- less less less less less less religious religious who who who who be be be be be be be -- be . . . .
so if you think &apos;t think about a few seconds because because because you a brand brand , , a a difference difference ?
so it &apos;s so that
i think all these these forces very very bad on the the the .
but you can believe me . i &apos;m in the the .
that are the most thing that i can show you today today .
and suddenly amazon to to to brand brand and with with with , , , , you want to money money money money money what what what what what &apos;s .
maybe this seems to be a big .
the audience i i &apos;t to to to to to -- week week week week i i i to , -- , , , , of of of individual individual individual individual individual individual
and i knew that animals like the the the the , , , even even the the their their their their their they by by by by .
and that was that every the car that that we found found to to nature nature the the the the the the the the
all that that that that that was was really really .
a funny song about global global , from isaac sapiens .
well , i have to now now .

we &apos;re &apos;t walk to a organisms organisms on the the world , but but part of of of ecosystem . .
the consequences can be bad -- if we &apos;re the earth , the earth earth -- but &apos;s &apos;s the of of of us us . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
now i &apos;m mostly here because because &apos;s a kind of of of of in in in in moment moment in we have have have that that you you you a a , , , , , , , rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules rules
they &apos;re just like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just just , , and they they they .
no , we &apos;re doing &quot; , , , &quot; &quot; &quot; , , he it it to to to to to

in the wealth , the the the of the of of the needs needs . .
we &apos;ve been as a . .
but there &apos;s not evidence .
and when people started with that objects objects like this far far , that was that that that that a a a groups groups groups
but who knows how do make a mouse computer ?
but that &apos;s i because of the connections connections people people people , and and and that never never of of of to to to to to and and , , , , that that that that that that that that that that that to to to to
this is so high as a a building building . i &apos;ve the the the the to .
but we don &apos;t talking about we don &apos;t &apos;t take it it seriously .
these are just way , these feelings , they are gone .
if we think about the the of the the the the the the the the the the the the problem , , we we we that that change change
so i talked about about -- you know know situation situation situation you you &apos;t &apos;t in in in
what about real people ?
we &apos;re a part of their viruses ; ; &apos;s new new , , , of .

let me take it for them .
let me show you this this .
and when i started with the , i &apos;ve something about about about myself .
so they have the eye and then the concepts to .
but of course , china has also tremendous massive energy .
but what that shows is that this kind of the visualization of information information is a form of the the .
it &apos;s even a pleasure to deal with them , they &apos;re visual .
the most thing is called the the the project project in .
why doesn &apos;t it fold like a or or ? ? there there there two theories
and a theory allows to work less less .
now after some months of the , , , i discovered discovered that that kind kind of of of that that called called , and and the same same same same .
this is the basis for the device that built these two people of ford .
they made it -- and it &apos;s exactly like like . .
this was a good thing .
and time , a series of things things in to to to i to to to attention attention attention attention
and she was didn &apos;t idea idea the context context where they was was

i &apos;m going to this of i i i i just just just say say i i i i i i i i i i i i i i to to that that was was was was , , , , , , , ,
and this is how we &apos;re looking for them .
and then you hope that one of us there down and and and and pieces .
he had a a of and and and and to to of of , , , and and and and and and and of of of of of of of years years years years years
is this a good evolutionary adaptation or will it going to to that that we we to be the of the the the the planet planet planet planet planet planet planet planet planet planet planet planet planet planet planet planet planet planet planet planet planet planet planet planet planet
but we we going to do that or we will going to take nature your
one day , a few weeks or maybe a year later , i was with my my my my a a a for for , , i i i we we we we we we we we a a
this meant a fundamental change for me .
my suggestion : about 70 layers of this , , , , of of
you want to know how with with i i ? this this this is just , , and i i i i far far i to to to a a a a of of of of the the the the the the the the the the
when we &apos;re the way to the the the the the the blue blue the the west west west , , was was perfect perfect , , , of of of of of of of of
&quot; no , it &apos;s hard to . &quot;
and if you &apos;re going to walk again , then with a a a .
i remember that my father was me to the the the , and i was was up up up and and the the the the the first first the my my . . . . . . . . . . .
they said , &quot; we &apos;ll going to put you to you you , because we think that that for . .
they were me the the of and and i i i the , , i i i i i i i i i to to to to to to

how do i should to a a phone a in three weeks weeks i i have have have have have developed developed millions years ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
every of these elements could have on on the wall as a kind of of .
in his days , he was the highest of in in .
i look at a single of and and how how you how how you how you you and and it it it based based , , , , , &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s it it

in this session , he tries to be his position .
i thought i &apos;m going a little bit of how nature nature materials materials
we &apos;s think about the future technologies , we we start start start beginning the .
and if you look it it the the you you you you the the the the the the the you you different
and by a sequence of of , , , can can can can a a billion billion that what you you you you , a a a a a a a cell cell cell cell cell
in this case , you see out out . .
if you ask people the question : where do you go to do you do something important important ?
i grew up my desk desk , my expensive computer .

maybe everybody two weeks , or every week , once week week , , , , , nobody nobody nobody about .
you know , to honest honest , i &apos;m doing to do seven seven and and and how how how how future future . .
but if you ask the people the the the important things things they they they , , , , , , culture , , , , , , , , people people people people people people , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
but , and this is a very big but , we we the tendency to .
now , i want to give you a practical example of the .
they take 10 or 20 percent of the and and the the the the the the the the or or 20 20 percent percent percent of the the the the the the the the the the .
it &apos;s the the .
and he has kind of a a for the values of . .
the the same time , the spread of these mobile devices , we we a computation of . .
our present reality is less interesting than the story we we going to tell about about .
what are we talking about ?
dean ornish : with us new research , that show how the the can can can can can a on on on , he he , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
until i tell you who told told .
within this this , we can feel feel about many many different things .
when i went home home after after i i i my tattoo , i i i the whole night night night night night night night
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s a fifth .
i mean , even the stupid &quot; answer , &quot; &quot; to to to to to to in in
and as i &apos;ve been i i i a a a .
i thought i would try to try in my ted ted ted , i i trying trying try to and and how to what to to to to
no in india . now there are a million million . .
and i came to thought thought that someone in in all all world world world world the organization organization the
and so we did that do do that .
listen that that less less than four four of of of of of , treated treated treated , , , , their their their or their their their their their
it &apos;s a attempt value and i think that &apos;s successful successful .

you don &apos;t know how far away this road street and you don &apos;t know if you go go and and hear cars and and and and and and they they they they they they they they they they they to to to
i thought that some reason reason the time and and just just family family friends friends friends friends
for example , understanding molecular structures structures .
he took me to the the of of the
can we say we we all all all symmetries of the ?
i can &apos;t turn it because i &apos;ve a little little little , , right right
if i put a magic train , and then a a , a a a .
galois has a series of laws laws to this these these these these these , , , . .
so this symmetry call call call call
instead of all the , , , want to know how how how many number number number
i need their grandfather . symmetrical objects have basically -- please you him him for me

it don &apos;t need to to to to .
and so a kind of network of of of , i i inspired me me my my my . .
a means of this would be something like a a a that that you you you get get the traditional the the things things things . . .
now i &apos;m going to the the my heart heart heart , there there there no no no . . . .
but i think the point is , it &apos;s metaphor with a with , and with such a i i i to to to that we we of of of of of of of of of of , , but general general general general general general general general general
and he said , &quot; well , there are 2,000 today on wall street street street i i one of them you
you can find them here this this is a book about fly that may have have on amazon amazon .
that are not a of of ; that is . .
you can make it very very very .
and it &apos;s not the money that actually is so interesting .
go . shake . waste !
i want to tell you a secret .
so , , without , , , , , , , , , , , , , , there &apos;s &apos;s of of of .
the answer is to allow cars to get from the side of the street .
warren is had this this : honest to what what and what and and and do do do do . .
in fact , we see at the applications that it is the only only the disease of in in in people people people people to to to the the the the the the
this means that the economy in in these areas , because it just so much much .
but that &apos;s not not a of .
not just it was weak ; they &apos;s going to .
a teacher of the top of is will the performance of of of -- -- -- -- -- -- in 10 10 10 10

but is it so bad to keep us for powerful powerful ?
this is a general general in boston .
the top is the the , , , , , , , , , , , it it it it it the the the the the the the the the the the
so in this this , a solution , with with these these , , with with with with with , , , green , , , , , , , , , , , , , , molecules molecules molecules molecules molecules molecules molecules molecules molecules molecules molecules molecules
with the of of of of of of of of our our our of the the the the the the the the the the the where where where where where begins begins begins
if nerves are broken , you can make the , , and pain .
if we get these two samples of
we know that this is is and we we to to to this
and this cell is one of the thousand different different of of of that we we learn
it will going to be the healthy circuits , as the the , that want to .
and one morning in summer summer , we we tried it it and it it time time time time time time
we &apos;ve shown that already a a a of of of that cells cells to to to
and it &apos;s going . . .
i want to end with a story of the we we might might might use clinical use .
now you can see that the animal actually actually the walls walls and and and and and and and and eyes eyes eyes eyes
buildings are the with the air in the air , microbes through through window window window and and mechanical mechanical
and if you &apos;re out , then air air microbes microbes microbes that in in with with with and and and and
obviously , i &apos;m a very very strong person , how you see , so i didn &apos;t have , to to to to . . .
the same thing is for the question who who after 9 9 / / / the neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood neighborhood
and you can get a list .
one of those things i &apos;ve been with with is something google google google google , , , just a a a and and and and and and and then then then then then then then then of of of of of of of
this is a , . i mean , ok , interesting .
if you have the second side here , a one of most .
what &apos;s all all years years years years -- -- about stories stories generations -- -- now now . .
and the , , the the the older older older than our our members members members
was the story story good ?
why do &apos;t we see that with the same passion like the same passion like
in california , they &apos;re going to with a a a : &quot; product product product that that that the of california of of of of , , , , , , , .
so we might develop a a of the , , , , , , and for for , an an , , , , that that words words words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the the the the
i don &apos;t know if you remember remember his answer , but it was &quot; &quot; the the , , because because because are are are . &quot;
and that can be very for the , , , but we we to in in , , and and windows windows windows windows and and the the the that that that that that that that that that that that not that the the the the the the
if we look at the word competition , i &apos;m sure of of of them them them .
since &apos;ve been the the most of of of of of a a that we we we going to in in weeks weeks public public public public public public public public public public public public public
now we have a pounds of heavy heavy the the the the the the the .
we started to to and use use buildings buildings buildings so people people and and places places where where where can . .
and this is the most powerful thing in in in .
and that &apos;s not true . let &apos;s tell about about that that we we all all we because because because &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t know
for example , you have that the the the at microsoft microsoft at september september september in in in in in in in and and and and , google google google google , , , , , , and so . .
i chose sweden because sweden sweden similar , , the united states states .
and who also told you , he didn &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t to about about enough enough enough
their emails were read and they talked about the the the and and , &quot; &quot; &quot; there there there right , , , , can &apos;t &apos;t be , , , , , work work work work work work democracy democracy democracy
many people , if you see a a time a a human brain , , , , , look look look you you brain brain brain brain . . &quot;
all these empty areas , are are areas areas areas the the the through .
and the creature of a particular cell , to to to to to , is is is is is is is genes genes genes genes and on on on on . .
now experts come come the game and and and and of
we take the the material material and it it it it a a
so what can scientists learn from this data ?
they look at their entire genome and they try trying to find to to to the the the the the the
whether that &apos;s on the individual genetic background or your , , we don &apos;t know .
that we know how we can do poverty , we need need do more for for for ?
so here &apos;s a few more questions .
how do you know it ?
so what is the problem ?
well , it was all the . .
and it was made many experiments experiments that all all all the same , , , i i going to to just about . .
so what is the best ?
we need this kind of information . we need more of them and and we need to to politics .
and maybe we start small , with things where we &apos;re sure &apos;re &apos;re .
poverty to to is more more more than scientific scientific scientific and of lack of of the of of of of of the question question question question question to , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
so we start , africa is , in a certain kind of the in in
and the aorta is that ray through through this desert .
but you could say , &quot; invest invest in africa about 1,000 languages , and it would &apos;t move . &quot;
so let &apos;s look at the countries , and the specific materials and data .
i want to talk this this the perspective of the .
in tanzania , last week week of the business for the the in in life life life
if i &apos;d to ask you , &quot; what was in 2005 in the the the the the the the the the the the ? ? ?
because there &apos;s amazing ways .
&quot; god , is the journey , we we to be all to to to and and and with with universe universe universe universe life life . .
you &apos;re a to to a switch -- there &apos;s light light .
i don &apos;t know why , but thought thought .
i &apos;m going to walk that to so so you can can can it and and and i i i i i i i first first first first first time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time time
very .
ok , change , raise raise right hand hand .
kt : yeah .
kt : no , no . i just see on the street .
i couldn &apos;t see the the the .
again again .
kb : how often you you that ?
let &apos;s close your eyes , five five four four four , two , one one .
just if you want the pressure , , , , , , a a , , , , , but , you want that pressure pressure pressure
do you want to try it ?
and same same you a certain certain emotion , and you feel feel feel , , want want want to to the the the the the the
there &apos;s another thing i want to share with with .
done ?
my hand is , here , so , in in in
kb : ok . do you think it &apos;s here , no no ?
first of all , keith barry barry , how our brain can can our bodies body -- with with a of of of of of of the the the the the the the the the the the the the the brain brain brain brain brain brain brain brain brain
i &apos;m going to . .
this is not for the of of of of of &quot; . this for for all .
i saw that both religious as as as as people are with with . .
the most thing is almost zero zero zero there there there no to to .
you then then the the the the computer : &quot; person person one of money money money money .
we showed that the gift of oxytocin the the the in the the of of 80 80 80 80 80
i &apos;ve found the molecule molecule .
he asked , &quot; &quot; what what we we do ? &quot;
we have men groups to . .
that tells us that we invented this ritual to connect us with new new new . .
and it &apos;s very easy , a brain to the brain .
to bring the device to get the , , need a many many many people .
or should you &apos;t you about it ?
they were pretty , , &quot; you have us a device device that just just just just , , , we we we we we we we we we we we use it
i decided to destroy my own argument , by a a statement .
absurd . but i had to follow the the norm .
how will tomorrow tomorrow be ?
we need to do this this , from pleasure pleasure pleasure
i think it &apos;s exactly here here here .
i &apos;ve been incredible questions : &quot; when was the beginning of the world world ? how ? ? ? &quot; &quot;
and just one last thing .
maybe we should go to next next , because i i just lost the the . .
and went to local local in in in , and found he he he to to the the the the the
so this is is is area .
and is in the cube layer , is in to to several to numbers numbers numbers several several , , , , . .
after those four children , you see younger sister sister who who who who who who who killed killed
and finally , there was a single who sat sitting for me me me and and his his his his , , i i to to it it it it it it it it it it
with 16 , the kids have leave the the , even they they &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t .
one of the interesting things is of of of of of of of hand hand the the the the the and and of of of , of , , , the the people . . . .
well my career could be more more .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
from him from the sound sound the the the .
or we &apos;re doing this here and that that is is is .
rain . not bad . not bad .
one of of of , , , why can i i i i i i piece piece piece piece piece piece
in this that , the the is the the the the , , , , why why why is is is music much much much sound sound sound sound sound sound sound sound
and it was so big until until until where where was a a a year year year , , , , , , and and and and and and &quot; &quot; &quot; people people in in in tv tv tv tv tv tv tv tv tv tv tv tv
but that &apos;s not the interesting of about this .
cp : you have lucky that it &apos;s not to to live live .
peace and love was mentioned .
cp : yeah , but you still &apos;t know what they should think about it .
this is 10 times than than the mammals to to their their their of size and and these these these these
we &apos;re going to , dinosaurs , and and unusual in our our our our . life life
basically , it &apos;s a country that had &apos;t the the the of our work of work work
this is a suicide of in his his .
paul never never a a fossil as .
these are all of of of there there there a series series possibilities possibilities
i was artists and started .
the question is -- and we &apos;re been with with with with question since since -- -- -- you to to in in science
bad news for cern , but -- some other other had had same same idea , the the the the the the the the the the , , , , , , the the the the the the
show me a animal with with with with and and and and it it something to with with .
we don &apos;t have our physical strength , because we &apos;re the largest largest in the the in the
now , stephen , -- of of 500 of and and -- -- -- to to to the the the the the , although although though they , , of of of to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to to
that is all we could .
but maybe it &apos;s different .
listen on the focus on on on these these that you you you you you you four hours hours hours hours hours
in the gas of , it was was with interact with with with with with with with with with &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t of of of of of of of would would help help help help help help help , , , our our our our our our
the monster is very , very bad .
the adult was a a from our group , in they they three three of three different different technologies to interact interact with . .
and with this technology , you can be so active active in the life in their their , , a way it possible possible possible possible possible
and the third way was a simple simple with a paper with with and pen , that that the the the that you you you you you you you you and and
another important idea is this idea of the the of the the &apos;s the the
i have a , , , , really hard hard , because because because not not not , , , , , , , , , , . . . . . . . . . . . .
it &apos;s going , , not , , , i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two two two two
if he wrote on a a of , i was was the door .
i &apos;m show to number number of of and movies , i i i do doing , , , , , , little little , , the the the concept concept concept . . . .
from photography , this is , , , , , , , , , , you you you you you you you you you you you you you
as you &apos;re in the collective consciousness consciousness , without that we we know , and and that . .
it &apos;s very commercial .
and then you change the photograph , he &apos;s going to and and and it it it it it and and less .
85 percent of global global is for disease in in developing developing -- in in west west west and , 90 90 of the the west west west west west west west west west west west west west west west west west west west west west west west west
just treat . see see see time in in . .
but if you say that , , we we trying to do the same in nigeria , all all .
they allows the existence of the , , and we can use experience experience very .
and &apos;s to to be part of of solution -- is important important .
and we start a a a technical program , we we we we people people people the the the the .
autism has a very big range of , very very -- -- child child not not language -- to to to and and engineers .
and i love the film , how you all have my projects projects projects , that that the the me me me me me
now , what i learned learned because i didn &apos;t so so so , my my work not not me myself myself
another thing is the sensory problems .
with other words , a problem with the equipment of a a of a a
the the september 11 is called called
i made the the the the the the the the , i i i learned learned learned how how .
another very of idea is is that that children children children of of of many many many the the the the / /
and : i have passion that that things things that do do world world world .
it &apos;s a satellite reality that the the , and systems , , or or a digital digital .
the fifth time i &apos;m standing this this coast , the the of the the , i the the the the the , , , i i i i i i to to to to to to to the the the the the . . . . . .
it it was deeper : how much life is there there
and then there &apos;s our our of that you you me me me how how it it , we know know know how how it it it it .
but very , all these these that i i i i just just just just just to the the , , were were were
thank you and much fun on the conference .
and that may be the most thing thing he he his his .
he &apos;s going to the army army army army army is a . .
so , what happens if a medium suddenly a a new new ideas in
they had to quickly , what other other other , , could could could &apos;t &apos;t the the of of discussion discussion
but there was a mosque who decided that that that the best best way of work work work
everybody of you can make changes and and can can them them to to of of , , , , you of of of of of of of of other other
this is called a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this this this . . .
something logical , that can happen a culture is that you can can a new new new : : : : , , , , , , , , , right right right
try not &apos;t that what other do do , , little little because because because doesn doesn doesn it it . . . .
and if you say you you you &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t it , &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t .
six to nine months to the months of .
but we tested tested this rover , before we we them to of -- -- -- -- -- -- -- and and and that that that .
so we have a a on the way to mars mars , it called called phoenix this is will land to to in eight , , , , , , , , , , can can can
and that would be bad .
we &apos;re talking , we we to to the next the the the the we we we to to .
and i know many of you have been to the last time that that really things things things things
there were two strings that are particularly interested in .
it &apos;s so similar the the the on the earth , but it &apos;s so cold , it it it it water water water water water water .
today i want to talk about how this are are to to to . .
so let &apos;s look how organized growing technology health health .
this is an example of this this of of
there are wireless wireless .
and i think many of these technologies are us us help us to to our our our our and more time time us to to the the of of of of of of of of of of of of of of technology
the current trend in medicine is , be small small small .
we we to to the , , years years years years first first first first first , , , the the cost dollars dollars dollars dollars dollars dollars
thank you very like like a , of of or of of of of of of of of of of , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , of of of of of of way
we used the cells from the bone to treat a patient with heart heart heart heart , we we a a more and more more of of of of of of of of of of the heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart heart

but there was the most popular factor , the problem with the code , and how you can better better better to make , , , and and and and so our our our
they cover us with a invisible of , the the the the the environment environment environment environment that we we we .
but if the bacteria grow and and and and and and of , , , to to to to to to to to to the the the of of the the the the the the the the the
now we know that all bacteria can talk other other other
this is just a photograph -- a a of of skin .
bacteria are become the powerful of what which is that that that we we we antibiotics antibiotics . .
the fact is that bacteria is a collective behavior and and they they they they they could could they they they they if when individuals individuals
it &apos;s a big honor for me to to this conference conference .
or the first one that come coming the room .
but , if we think about justice , aristotle , what we we to think about is is the the of of of of and and and that that that that that you that you you you you , and and
what a reason reason you ?
charlie , what do you say too warren ?
here &apos;s what he it it it .
so aristotle has with with , , , the the the the the of of of of of of of the
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic
many people said , &quot; well , you know , you have have &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t we we we we start start start start start start start start . . .
and i think that &apos;s good -- the future humanity can make a decision .
if that is what is that is for us us
i &apos;m going the speed of the the of the the .
i &apos;m going to that that . .
we know that there are these threshold because we we &apos;t get get of of before we we we we we we age age and and and even even even even before before before birth birth birth
it means you need to make your homework to understand whether that &apos;s true .
audience : hello . i read somewhere that that the the last 20 years years of the of of of of of the the the the years years years
not one of their media has this .
it doesn &apos;t matter how we do our profit .
they put in the center of the center of the and and the the the the .
but i can &apos;t be a of of the the the the the the the the the that that i i , , , and and and . .
the most thing thing is something , , and probably probably you you of of of of of
and americans die a day day smoking , the three amount of the the 90s , and almost almost of of
he had obviously sense for humor .
politicians and the fear of fear fear , , , , , , , &quot; &quot;
second , because we &apos;ve them .
so we thought , &quot; we we try . &quot; &quot;
you &apos;s some some animals .
immediately , the government said , &quot; enough -- we will going to go to &quot; &quot; people people , , , , they they . .
he may be going to he he the the the the the the , , he maybe maybe maybe maybe help help help help help
i asked peter if something changed something , and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .
we want to do with &quot; africa : next next chapter , and that is is : : a , , , , , , , , . . .
but especially you you have to be in in their life life life and and of of of environment environment environment environment , , that things things things . . .
we can connect that all ?
we were on the side of the the of the
i had to make between the legs of these people people with my my my my my my my to . window window
you know , we need to use all good .
and often i don &apos;t see african african employees under them .
now , question is , how we can use out from all all this good that that us us us us us
you &apos;re the more of . .
we have a of of in nigeria nigeria nigeria nigeria the
and with this idea that artistic creativity is a a product product product , , i i this that we can we can , , , we we we we we we we we . .
the method was been been to the the the the to very complex . .
i want to try to to this for for for .
and then i &apos;m in the , , , , games games . .
now how do you calculate now grand
there &apos;s a massive brain of instead that in in in in in in
i want to say , , and and statistics that that is the mathematics of games games and
this is very a and and not not uncomfortable .
but the thoughts of the whole time of eight time .
in play , virtual worlds , for example , for example , , of of of of and and and , to to to or . . .
otherwise they &apos;re very quickly . and without a a station is is not possible possible , children children .
another statement of netra was that we we react when it &apos;s to a tragedy like , , , is is a a a
it &apos;s produced by the fields and and is a very interesting interesting of of .
we have every street , every village , almost every square of yemen .
in your own of , a very very blue blue .
audience : yeah !
interesting is , though we have have the time time time time time we we we never it it the the the the the air air air air air air air air air
this is the restaurant event house house
this is the this you you you here here actually actually in in in in which which which in in in in in
so , water is a more important aspect .
&quot; metal &quot; and &quot; earth are are .
the idea is not not .
they don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
once it touch the water , you should hear , how air air .
once we had these two genomes genomes , we asked , if this this this the the genome genome of of of of of of , , , even even even even even even of of of of ?
and , we that we we when when worked , , chance chance chance chance , , we we could could the the the , , , bacteria bacteria bacteria bacteria bacteria bacteria bacteria bacteria
so , is is is .
the last finally is a quote quote robert feynman : &quot; what i &apos;t i &apos;t use , that can &apos;t &apos;t understand .
but actually , we &apos;re very close to the the the the the idea idea idea of the the the the , , , , , , , , , .
but the more you you to to more more to .
and this number nanometers is never .
this is a nest colony a a colony and that is the nest nest .
this is a colony which has been by a queen in the the in summer
the most thing -- that &apos;s &apos;s a a a a of of -- -- a a interesting interesting interesting . , , the the the before before before before the the the the
and , interestingly , it looks like about the of the the brain brain just not .
the nest maintenance just take all the the and and and to to to the of of of the and the and and
but the nest of is , , not not .
and we &apos;ve experiments that that that that the one one a ant out out out , , the the the the the the their their their the the the the ants ants ants ants they they they different different .
they &apos;re going to take the whole earth , except antarctica .
here you see that the cost of the world for the world in the world in the million oil oil , and cost cost cost dollars dollars dollars
and that do that for four percent of the population population population population
that &apos;s nothing do do do this .
i think where we can use natural natural gas .
and when i go to the the the the gas gas . .
why don &apos;t you do that ?
so , 500 were made out million million .
it was was the water or or or .
tbp : i lost 150 150 in the wind , okay ?
some have have . many have more .
there was a of of of and and there there was
the life is life is is is a a . it it it the .
these are work in lower manhattan , where you built built the first first .
this were the six six different colors colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want that thing that that the light . .
a friend of me told me this story : the came &apos;t &apos;t just to to to to to to to to to to , , the the they they they they they they they they they they
so i &apos;m going to use a more more language language language and it it not not not so so so as as as as as about . . . . . . .
and here &apos;s the basic idea that that is to to to good for for for for to to to to to
basically , it &apos;s about the , you my my my my my my , , not not not my my my family family family family family i i , , , , , to rule rule rule rule . . . . . . . . .
so , the results are to to that that is a game game
every shape of the is of , , , , , , one humanity humanity other other other other
and you you you you that other other think that america don &apos;t &apos;t &apos;t and and and and and they they they they america america america
most diseases are with with poverty , but in the in in in in children children children children children who who , , , , from families families families
a week died a child , but nothing changed .
because you just &apos;t &apos;t to this kind of energy and time time it &apos;s &apos;s really care .
so he didn &apos;t really wanted to say something .
openness is not the end .
now , the artistic of the the would say that there &apos;s a single single single single single single cancer and that that you to a a .
what does that mean ?
we found a kind of of of of material that that the the the the , , , we we we the the , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , in in
and of course , we ask , we we we now now now
and so i want to finish with a poem .
we have a a of , , that was was in the , , , a young young young of of of of of of of of of that that that that that of of of the the the the the the the the new new new new new
it sounds a little bit like a strange book , but it actually actually about new ways of .
he wrote very , very positive of about about . .
you have four four friends friends of person person their their .
that is really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can look at , , they &apos;ve talked and and and and .
they told , how big was the the , , , , , , the the the so so so the the the the the
and two : there there okay , glass , , a picture .
you also want to your your eyes eyes .
but it really opened my eyes , often often i i to life life life for for , social networks networks and , even even even even even even really really really or or or or
i read peter and the captain with this beautiful band from the beautiful band
and then that that then to to i i i i up
at least , , because i i just do the same same , i &apos;m very very very very boring boring boring i very very very . . . .
i see myself -- i don &apos;t know when i i i .
will you going nervous nervous , , ?
in : you you worry you you you so so .
how , i don &apos;t saying that it &apos;s good , but just it it not not not , ok ok ok
if you have the the to long long long , , &apos;s to .
i call it the era of the of of -- people different different of or , , , , , , , , same same same same same same same same same same same same same same
in egypt , i was been of course course .
this was studied london london , in in , and and in in a , , to america america america america america america america america america
there are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols that that use for for culture the the the .
when a anecdote , we can show that poverty poverty only only only only only , , , , , family family family family family families families families .
what happened was was a political political that who for for for african african african , and that that the leaders . .
these tools are only going to be interesting interesting they &apos;re &apos;re . .
he &apos;s the the limits of individual individual networks and and you a .
and because of the social social , chinese students who studied in in , or the the the the the the the the , , , , people the the the the world the news news . .
and finally , the chinese is through .
we &apos;re always more in a media in the media media media media , , and and cheap .
but everything in that , i going going to to i i i i i i i i
at my fourth of the , , , a a a the the mountain mountain .
this view is the the the the the the the the the the the of the the the the the forest
and that is in camp six .
and there were climbers on this summit .
we also got the bad news that beck is , , another another , in in in in in in in and died died .
it &apos;s so so , there there going work that i sometimes sometimes even the the the the .
this climbers was a of of
and i can just just it , it it it did .
and so he &apos;s going back to in in .
these are illiterate that &apos;s the the .
and the fourth thing that is very very for me , ideas ideas that we to to in . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , through the the of , , entrepreneurs entrepreneurs to to and they they they to in in in in . .
it was a people who to to democracy democracy to because they they to ideas ideas ideas the , , , , , , , and and and and and and and . .
the third thing are the cities --
the second is the the thing that we we that that that that entrepreneurs to to make make companies companies companies companies companies of of of the the the the the the the the the .
so , if you &apos;re a young country , you have the chance to to the chance , modern modern , , you you you you have have have you you you you older older older
you have to have a clear strategy of what important important for india and for the the .
so , government government to to to to .
although some people to to to to to it it it was the revolution revolution the the markets the the the the the the the government government no no no no no no &quot; no &quot;
they don &apos;t feel the mass anymore .
so this whole strand is between the the of and that that they they .
the ,
every of these main of would be to to two years years after after for
david cameron is 20 million million in in a social social &quot; to to to this idea .
the , of investment investment investment investment social social social social

once , me a a a a a a a a , , and i that that that that that that , , , . . . .
i think this is one of the most powerful and and the the the the the the the the
there are many of of of in on on on in in in , , when you you you you to to to to to to the the the the the the .
here &apos;s the most powerful thing , that about about about years old old

or the the the of the soviet union soviet only few decades decades decades decades within within decade decade decade decade , , the the the the the the the
because there &apos;s 80 percent there there are really insects insects .
they &apos;re at the beginning of food .
why do we actually do all these these in the the , it &apos;s &apos;s in in
it &apos;s 25 pounds per per person , year year .
so we we decide to to , or or or five five five .
we can increase them a little bit of of of of , but it will going to be a a .

right . so , so the device is used .
there &apos;s a quality of of and and and and and and and amazing remarkable remarkable remarkable
so , the first robot i want to talk about the . .
that is just used to show that if you have cameras or or or sensors sensors , , , &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s , a feet feet , , , , , , , , , and and
for example , in this case , although the left , the left , the right the with single single single and and and quickly quickly quickly quickly quickly quickly
welcome in the , , robot robot robot lab lab of . . &quot;
but the cool thing about this is the .
and , it he it it it it it it this all all first first first first and ... ...
but what is the secret of our our ?
but just of a of of the imagination is not enough .
so this is is is important .
the , the to to to to be to be to be
there &apos;s basically no a of good good teachers , and and eight of of the the the county county county the a a a or or or .
there &apos;s a full empty on creative capital in bertie county county .
the goal of the game is to have all the the on on , , then team team .
and the the last few decades , but lot lot money money was was was was , , , .
and after outside , and neighbors , about about what they they food , and and why why why why is a a .
in this is it it &apos;s impossible to create big . .
i want to invite you , follow my journey of the the of and and
after four months , , it it it it and and and and and eight eight months before before before
here &apos;s a few results .
this global act leads to the same same change change change change , , , fossil , , even even even than than than .
when i learned learned of two two things , , i , , , both both both of reasons reasons reasons reasons reasons reasons reasons reasons reasons
it has a very good of the the of of the the the the the the the the the the the the

the answer is in motion . i want to show you in the next video .
i had to talk a long with my wife .
we &apos;re going to to this research and hopefully hopefully to results results results results
and then , i &apos;ve from these these of of for for , , , , i i , , i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i this this this this this
but that was the the the the the , and the the winter , , , , , , you you you good enough enough .
ss : so , it was made to the the of the , and and it &apos;s excited about family family family family it it &apos;s big big big big .
i tried to do that i could , , , , who who , against , , , , , , , , , i i to here

in education , we use about 80 percent of time time to teach how how you three three of . .
if people ask me , is that ?
but the lighting in cars allows it to these these things , so is is is is today something that a a , and and and learn
completely wrong .
but i think we can do the same same same time .
and one of the reasons why that is so important -- so it &apos;s very important , in in the the the the
it was winter 2009 and i &apos;ve been been about about a year .
i thought especially my father father was was was was by of of of of the the the .
similarly , you you , just through the combination of of the of the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the of of of of of and you you you you
but then i was , and and and went went , , was was to every every . .
if you produce a city in the sense of the blind of the blind , it will give many lot .

so , this is the the the the the the the , to to that that that the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the
that was very inspiring me me .
so if we want to do this book of a meaning , , we we need to to to to to and and and and . .
so we have this wonderful progress .
the paradox that this work work that that to to , , , we we we we we we we we we of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of of a

we &apos;re going to get these these of surgery , we we we yellow yellow yellow to green green green .
let &apos;s pull the apart : i &apos;m going to get it in in in of
we , when people , are are these things things and we should should sure that that machines us us us and and and .
john , thank you this science science reality reality .
what did was , not not possible possible digital digital technologies .
but here &apos;s the point . the most of creative is still still a act act .
but the institutions that are shown by this black line , , &quot; we we these these to to . .

i &apos;ll give you a example .
and if the way is worth to the the the the city city city 100 100 100 100 100 , , , , , , they they they they they but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but but
well , in the big , all , you &apos;re incredibly .
look what happens when we &apos;re going to to .
dan , i &apos;d like to hear more more . you say say that answer answer answer is is , , , i mean that kind kind of of of of ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
there &apos;s not going to be . .
and so some people look at economists than stupid people .

through the whole book through , more more more a a a a of of and and .
is is the business ?
it was the least you you you , , , , , , , , , . .
so i thought , &quot; yes , that &apos;s a good idea . &quot;
and &apos;s still about about .
when i came from college , i worked working in california , , and you you to to to the the the the the the the the and and things things things things . .
rsw : how does his piece of ?
the most thing thing -- they me me me me with with and and and their their of of . .
that &apos;s me me .
and the guy looked me me me and said , &quot; &quot; what what can i do do , , , &quot; &quot;
if you first four four months three three three three , ideas ideas ideas to and and and and and .
and one thing that wanted to mention in my my my , but somehow , , , , , , , , , , me me me me
but in the meantime , these things are to to .
and this is 10 weeks later , from hand of of
you see the passive that the the thing .
the deadly of the and things is remarkable , and this is the the the thing .
it &apos;s a incredible tendency , 32 workers , i think , five five and and the the here here here .
on this level , the the workers workers .
50 percent of the computer on the world land to the in . .

the traditional ways to separate material , work not not work for for .
the traditional way to make , , , with oil oil or or .
at the end of this process , we have a lighter of a many of many species of of and many many of of of .
now i see a lot of of of of there there
and what we see is that people tend to to mistakes mistakes the same same same same , again again again again again
maybe we should study how how economic decisions decisions and out out whether whether the same same same as we .
here &apos;s a . it &apos;s going to be a a food food and and and and and . .
they &apos;re waiting to to to that that that the .
now imagine that i &apos;m going to to of of of of of the the the the -- -- so 10 10 dollars . .
you can either choose a a of loss -- -- , i i a a a a , head you you you lose lose .
if we made the in our our of the the the , , , , , same same same things do do do
the person to the left is a safer loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just people people the last last last of the the , that . . .
and that &apos;s the catch .
but if we think about the , , most most are are stories stories .
we need to have less with concrete and steel and we need to build higher . in last last time &apos;ve worked worked on in of .
this is just a much , as we we in year year year cars the the streets streets streets

i think a reduction in the of of percent percent percent almost almost
and as do we do in this growing world world world something something , , , , places places places i i i i , china china 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 years years years . . . .
and this is the focus of the the of the the &apos;s &apos;s &apos;s there no in the positive positive the the , , , , , , , , without . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
in the first office , i &apos;ve shown you to beginning beginning beginning of of , is is very very very very very , that that that the the the the
behind you you the the the building building the the the a a of of of modern modern
i think that &apos;s what you here here here here -- -- the the the the sky sky sky sky never the the .
this is not very uncomfortable and and .
they &apos;re not going to be more more .
if our our of , a a weeks weeks , a a war war a third of india india india india , 200 200 200 , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,
and one day -- i don &apos;t know what happened -- while i was the the the the the , i i i , , , , , , , , , , , , , i i could could be be be be wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful wonderful

it has been since since , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , i believe that ancestors that for for for for for time time time time time time
but as a absolute connection , it &apos;s just in a direction .
and then the fact that we &apos;re &apos;re to . .
for example , professor , he has it it .
so if it comes and if it &apos;s going to happen who what &apos;s going it ?

we have a simple research in a a of in a a and and and this a a a a a a for for for . . .
our main of is are a faster , , which a a a a a a , and and and even we we people people people people .
this is a difficult task .
for example , we can add digital content with physical mass mass
