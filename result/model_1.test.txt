you know , one of the great , big amounts of work , and one of the pleasures in the field of research is to live with people who remember the old days . they still feel the wind in the wind , they &apos;re going to taste rocks , they &apos;re going to taste the pirate sheets of the plants .
just knowing that the idea of the way that the idea of the way that the myth is still beyond the milky way , or the meaning of the oldest of the inuit is still , or the the shortest of the shoe is going to be the shortest , the idea of a group of mutual adaptation , which is the idea that the world is in which we have , in fact , a whole sense of view , but it &apos;s just a model of reality .
and of course we all share the same thing .
we &apos;re going to be born . we bring kids to the world .
we go through the field of water .
we have to deal with the inexorable separation through death and so that we shouldn &apos;t surprise that we all sing , dance and create art .
but interesting is the unique optimal loop of the design , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the most powerful in the forests of borneo , or the warrior in haiti , or the warrior in the most violent of the world , or a more , the warrior in the highlands , or a more , the mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother &apos;s mother , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m traveling in a month in the desert , everest , the mother goddess of the world .
all these people teach us that there are other kinds of other people thinking , other ways to make sense of the earth .
and that &apos;s a notion that if you think about it , you can only fulfill a hope .
together , the vast cultures of the world are a net of a grid of dna and cultural life that &apos;s going to be the earth and for the earth as important as the biological growth system that you know is the biological growth system .
you can imagine this cultural design model as a design model , and it can be considered the most powerful of all the thoughts and dreams , myths , inspiration and intuitions that have been made by human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
the most powerful legacy is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we &apos;re capable of and what we &apos;re capable of as an amazing species of species .
and as much as the biosphere was very windy , this was happening with the most powerful -- just even greater speed .
no biologist would say to say that 50 percent or more of all kinds of things are gone from extinction , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the most powerful thing that we &apos;re looking at is the most common thing to the cultural diversity .
and the key judge is extinction of the languages .
when everybody was born in this room , we were talking to 6,000 languages in the world .
now , a language is not just the sum of the vocabulary or a series of plastic types .
a language is expression of the human mind .
it &apos;s a means that &apos;s a soul that &apos;s going to be found with a particular culture of the material .
every language is like a forest forest of the mind , a point of view , a thought , a very spiritual way of being spiritual .
and from these 6,000 languages today , while we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , the half of the people are not going to be able to be more of the children in the ears .
they &apos;re not taught to be taught for infants . that means if nothing is going to be done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely when the silence of being used to be a one of the last your people who are talking to your language , not to have a way to have the wisdom of the ancestors , or hope to expect to expect the ability to be ?
and yet , there &apos;s a terrible destiny of this terrible destiny , in fact , about two weeks , because all two weeks , every two weeks , a elderly dies , and takes the last runway of a old language with a grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; is it not better ? &quot; would not be the world , if we all talk to a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be a storyteller that &apos;s a storyteller . &quot;
let &apos;s be aria . &quot;
and then you would suddenly recognize how it would be , if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so i want to take you in a way today , and i &apos;m going to take you through a journey of the ted system , a short journey through the most violent , to try to make sure what &apos;s lost .
now there are some of us who forget that i &apos;m saying , &quot; different possibilities of the his , &quot; really different possibilities of his mine .
for example , take this kid of the world &apos;s oil , the 21st of the amazon , the people of the world &apos;s population , believe that they &apos;re going to be the most prolific of the east of saint snakes .
this is a people who don &apos;t distinguish cognitively between the colors and green , because the forest of the forest , which is the people depend on the forest , the people are dependent on .
they have a strange language , and a linguistic language called the linguistic language , you have to marry somebody who &apos;s talking a different language .
all of this is going to increase in the mythological past , which is curious to these big houses , where the most of the time of the world &apos;s population is spoken , but in the middle of the six or seven languages , you &apos;re never listening to someone who learns a language .
they just hear and then speak .
or , one of the most fascinating tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the most amazing of ecuador in the northeast of ecuador , was an amazing people who was first attacked by july , peaceful teszler .
in 1957 , five commandments were going to contact and made a mistake of a mistake .
they took up photographs of the air , which we would be more sensitive to as a friendly gesture , and they forgot that these people were never seen anything about the rainforest in their lives .
they took these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see behind the face or the character , didn &apos;t find anything and the character , and they were killing the girl &apos;s work , and killed the five commandments with the spear .
but the most successful , not only killed the spear .
they &apos;re going to be involved in each other .
54 percent of deaths happened by the sex rate .
we followed the top eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death and when we put people with hyperscore , they gave them that one of the people has become so old that he died because of his age and we killed him .
but at the same time , they had a clear clue of forest , which was amazing .
their hunters could smell the urine of a single 40 steps away , and determine what species of these were in this particular part .
in the early days of years , i got a really amazing task when my professor approached harvard , whether i was interested in walking to haiti and to infiltrate the secret societies that were the foundation of the strength of the power and the secret of the strength that was used to make sure to make sure .
to give this spirit to a sense of , of course , i had to think about this remarkable belief of the most remarkable faith of the world &apos;s imagination and voodoo is not a civil war of the black magic .
the contrary , it &apos;s a complex kind of worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask you , the great world of the world &apos;s great world , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism or whatever .
a continent is going to leave , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious faith , of course , and , of course , it &apos;s just the little of this very profound religious thought that &apos;s been the tragic of the great religious thought of the world &apos;s population .
but what was interesting is that this is a living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living parts of the mind .
the minds can be taken from under the large water , answers to the rhythm of dance to the soul of living to the living , so that the most powerful for a brief moment is to god .
so , the most popular thing is , the most popular thing is , &quot; your white white is going to the church and talk about god .
we dance in the temple and will be god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with that , you &apos;re taken from the mind . how can you make damage ?
look at this amazing demonstrations : the red demonstrations in a computer , the red coal without burning , an amazing illustration of the ability to influence the body that this is the same thing that it &apos;s going to be doing in an extreme aggressive state .
now , from all people i met , the kogi from sierra nevada de santa 1979 in the u.k. nevada , the most extraordinary .
offspring of the old civil civilization , the caribbean , the caribbean &apos;s center of colombia , and in the course of the crater , this people in a central form of the railroad , which is rising in a central place of the world .
in a corporate continent , these people were the only ones who never had been covered by the most violent .
until today , you &apos;re going to run from a ritual priesthood , and the education of the priesthood is very extraordinary .
the young people are separated in age three and four years of their families , and in a deep world of darkness , in the middle of the glacier , to 18 years of , to be able to mimic the nine months of pregnancy , they &apos;re going to be elected to the very big mother of the pregnant mother , they spend a lot of time in the face of the great mother .
and as this whole time , they &apos;re introduced to the values of their society , values that sustain the claim that their prayers and only their prayers , the cosmic -- or we might say , the ecological -- balance .
at the end of this amazing , you &apos;ll suddenly take a little bit out of the end and the first time in your life , in the age of 18 years , you see a sunrise , and in this particular moment of consciousness , the first light is going to be the way that you &apos;ve been experiencing the idea .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you must protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is going to be very important .
whenever we think about native and landscape , we either have a little bit of a pain and the old peculiar of the fancy wild , which is a thought of the thought that is a thought of the thought , or the other , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we do .
so , indigenous are neither a fan , they &apos;re not going to be a vegetarian .
it doesn &apos;t remain a lot of space in the world &apos;s position of life , or the cold winds of tibet , but yet , through time and ritual a mystery of the earth , it &apos;s shaped by the time , which is not being able to be aware of the earth , because it &apos;s going to be conscious in the human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child from the andean , the most of the life that is a mountain , which is a mountain , or your destiny , will be a very different person , and a different relationship to this resource , and a different relationship to that resource , is that a mountain can be a bunch of rocks , which can be washed up .
if he &apos;s a peanut , or a pile of sugar , it &apos;s irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor , which defined the relationship between the individual and the nature .
i grew up in the forests of british columbia , and i believed that these forests are there to become a more powerful .
that made me a different person when my friends were under the most violent , believing that these forests of the testes and the curved spirits are , the most prolific and the brain spirits , the most prolific , the people who are going to live in their own business .
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took only last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is a little bit of a sudden , from many of you , the most powerful logic of the repertoire of the repertoire of the human repertoire .
what makes the most intriguing thing is not just the most powerful potential of this kind of thing , but it &apos;s actually made of it . it &apos;s made of two different sources , and on the one hand , there &apos;s this wooden , which is a series of blood , which is a little bit of a blood of the family , which is the name of a car of the family , which is the name of a car of the family , which is a little bit of a blood &apos;s mouth .
these plant contains some very strong , very strong , which is the serotonin , and the brain &apos;s very similar way .
if you &apos;ve seen the most powerful , you &apos;ve seen this stuff , this substance that you &apos;ve made of different kinds of things also .
this powder is about the way to get shot from a design of a film , and the hidden image of the sun , and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to create any bias of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have my professor , richard evan , who was the man who showed the most popular of the magic mushrooms in mexico , and i said that you couldn &apos;t be able to be able to experience this kind of thing as a hallucination , because in the moment you feel the impact , you &apos;re not going to be able to experience a hallucination .
but the thing about the brain is that they can &apos;t be taken in , because they &apos;re not going to be able to be in the human gut , of course , in the human gut , of course , to be called the name of the name .
you can only put it into connection with some other chemicals that are the mao , the mao .
now the fascinating thing is that the most amazing thing that contains in the brain &apos;s population are the same , the way that it &apos;s necessary to get the power of the world , so ask yourself .
how can these people from an agricultural country of 80,000 species are not finding these two types of food , which is not related to these two types of plants that are in the way that the whole of the parts is , is that the whole thing is larger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trying and error , which apparently turns out to be meaningless .
but ask the indians to say , &quot; the plant is talking to us . &quot;
so , what does that mean ?
this tribe , the most powerful , have 17 varieties of water that you all see in a big distance in the forest that seems to be a way of being a way .
and then you ask them how to build their own and they say , &quot; i thought you &apos;re going to understand something about plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you take every one of the 17 varieties of dna and you &apos;re singing in a different set of different forms .
now , this doesn &apos;t bring you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting a little bit more interesting .
now , the problem is that even the most difficult thing that you have to do is to have the kind of the best possible to do the native of native americans , but you &apos;re looking at the past , but you &apos;re kind of on the past , as the real world , is the fact that our world , is the most extension world .
so , the fact is that you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century , and you &apos;re not going to remember the wars of a technical innovation , but rather than a period where we were present and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth either active or more passive .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new zealand .
and the problem is not the technology .
the most popular hearing didn &apos;t hear less to sioux than they were leaving and arrow of tasks as the americans stopped being , when they stopped the horse and the other .
not change and technology refers to the integrity of the world &apos;s integrity ; it &apos;s power . ugly face of the rule .
and wherever you go in the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures are not the doom . these are dynamic living peoples that are being able to be locked up through the capacity of adaptation , and that &apos;s where they &apos;re going to be able to fill in the world , and they &apos;re going to be isolated , and they &apos;re going to be isolated , and they &apos;re going to be isolated , and they &apos;re going to be isolated , and they &apos;re going to be isolated , and they &apos;re going to be
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m going to work a lot of work , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the most violent extinction of people &apos;s living , but the most violent , the destruction of the human beings , will not only be convicted , but generally , and more , and they &apos;re in general , and they &apos;re in general and a part of a health system .
and you can &apos;t understand the grammar of tibet if you haven &apos;t experienced it on the ground level .
i traveled to a young colleagues of the introvert miles of the amateur , in the galapagos of the galapagos , and i was looking at the face of the street behind the galapagos , and i was seeing the face behind the statistics of the statistics that were killed by the most violent and an ashes . 1.2 million people who were murdered during the cultural revolution .
the father of this young baby was identified as an followers of the original lama .
that meant he was killing the chinese invasion .
his uncle fails with her holiness , who brought people to nepal .
his mother was locked up when punishment was for -- for crimes .
he was driven by two years in prison to hide under their own , and they could not live with him without life .
the sister who was doing this brave did was brought into a school scanner .
one day she came out of a set of people on a set of people , and they had to have this kind of thing for seven years in a tough labor market .
the suffering of the berlin can be testable , but the most powerful mind of people is something more nuanced .
and at the end , we &apos;re really going to be a choice . do we want to live in a world &apos;s world of the world &apos;s flu or in a world of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity ?
margaret mandelbrot , the great anthropologist , before she died that it &apos;s the greatest fear that we &apos;re moving towards a needle , and we &apos;re going to move , and we &apos;re going to wake up , and we &apos;ll wake up with a dream of the human imagination , and we &apos;ve forgotten one day , and we &apos;ve just wake up in a dream .
and it &apos;s a humbling to think that our species may exist since 600,000 years .
the main revolution that brought us the agriculture and we &apos;re in this moment of the marine union , which translated poetry from the delivery of the world through the prose of the priesthood , and the hierarchy of the surplus -- found a decade ago , just 10,000 years ago .
modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we are in the ensuing millennia .
if we ask these myriad types of information to the meaning of human questions , you know about 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to hire the possibility to be what we are : people with full consciousness that are aware of the importance that all people and gardens have to be thriving , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took in the northern end of the mountain , when i went to the top of the street , and this man , the baby , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather &apos;s grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the most of the time in the world &apos;s population , they were forced to pull in neighborhoods .
the grandfather &apos;s grandfather refused to be .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the weapons and all the tools .
now you have to know that the inuit don &apos;t have a fear of the cold . they used them to their advantage .
the most of their sled were originally made of fish that were thrown in in a refugee &apos;s hospital .
the man &apos;s husband didn &apos;t fear the arctic night , or the shooting storm .
he went out to the outside , he made his pants out of the street , and he &apos;s got his hand in his hand , and when the feces began to market , he formed it in the form of a single one .
he was hanging out the pages of the mountain of the mountain and it was completely frozen , he was a dog with it .
he was making the dog and screaming a given , took the skeleton of the dog and knitting a ride , sat on the front of the dog and the back of the street with the water on the outskirts of the stadium .
so you can &apos;t do anything like that .
and this is a symbol of the resistance of the inuit , and all native americans on the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april 1999 , the complete control of a field , which is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country , and it &apos;s called a problem .
it &apos;s an independent area . they &apos;re all controlling the whole lot of the water .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state , the state of the people , can look for his people and reach .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who traveled to these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not away at all .
they &apos;re the most powerful of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination , go back to the past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , are part of the hope of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is that we believe that politicians never do something .
we believe that the fact that we believe that the fact that we believe that the fact that we believe that the fact is that the fact that we think that the world is not compelling , but we believe that storytelling can change the world and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website will get 35 million more than every month .
gh nations send our transportation team .
our magazines are read from millions .
and we have a series of trips to the most of the trips that we &apos;re taking to places like this cultural wonder that they were blinded by the things that are made of the things that we can do , and hopefully , they will be able to find a more vivid revelation of the world &apos;s own well-being , that the wisdom of all people can contribute to our collective well-being .
thank you .
what i first can tell you about , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we &apos;re doing microsoft as part of a year ago , and it &apos;s a very , very big , and it &apos;s a environment where you can either deal with local or distant data .
we see a lot of people here , many of the things that you can see in digital photographs , which you can see , and you can see , the bailout , the guards , can lead to any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we &apos;re looking at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this is a scan of the library , and it &apos;s a scan of a library of 300 .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that the performance of a system can be driven is that the number of digital markers can be a number of times in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of the design .
this is a house house from glenn . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it really is a text and not about a picture , we can do something like this to really show that this one is real representation of the design and no image .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a more , a more unfair .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a kind of a , case , this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a piece .
and that really gives you the pleasure and the good experience of a magazine or a newspaper to read a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with multiple scales .
we also did something about the corner of this particular copy of the guardian .
we &apos;ve created a false display with very high resolution , which is much higher than a normal display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even technical specs .
and this really reaches these ideas , these limitations for the available place to the screen .
we hope that this is not a builder and other nonsense , which is that it shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , the mapping is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i &apos;m really not going to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re going to be doing this .
but these are all roads in the u.s.
the top on the top of nasa &apos;s picture is the nasa .
now let &apos;s get a little bit out of it .
now , this is even live in the internet . you can do it .
this is a project called the name of the name , which is really two different technologies combined .
one is a very good research , and the other is a very good research about the noah who of the noah , who of the university of washington , in the university of steve .
and rick &apos;s research was done by microsoft &apos;s research , a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s driven by the internet .
you can see that if we can create this kind of view , where we can penetrate through images and make this experience of post-traumatic resolution .
but the spatial framework of images is actually in the matter of meaning .
the most popular ones have taken these pictures together , and they put the real space in which these images that were all done near the surface of the coast of the canadian , they &apos;re actually , they &apos;re going to be given the elements of the slides , or they &apos;re all in relation to each other .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i &apos;ve got to show you other environments .
there are what we have , which is a lot of concentration .
i &apos;d like to show you straight to one of the original data sets of weekends , and that &apos;s from a early prototype of the past that we &apos;ve been working on in summer to show you what i think is really the punchline that we have on the website . and that &apos;s not necessarily the way you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers as many as we were .
this is a reconstruction of voodoo dame , who &apos;s just in the computer with images of flickr , just give you the ace of flickr &apos;s lady in flickr , and they &apos;ll get pictures of men in t-shirts and they &apos;ll get pictures of men in t-shirts , and they &apos;ll get a picture of the picture that was discovered as this model .
so this is all the most sophisticated , and they &apos;re all in the way that they &apos;re in relation to each other .
and we can navigate in this very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i &apos;m going to work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception right here .
i suspect you can see that this is a lot of different cameras : everything is in the way that the standard of the world is to professional professional services , a pretty large number of them , which were all going to be in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird things .
many of you are covered by faces , etc .
somewhere here , there &apos;s a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster of johannes dame , which was really recorded .
we can move from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point here is that we can do things with social environment , and now it &apos;s data from all collected -- from the whole collective memory of how , as opposed to the earth -- and everything will connect each other .
all these photos are going to be connected and it creates something bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from all the earth .
look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen kamen on virtual earth .
and this is something that &apos;s going to use through the complexity , which is the people using it , and it &apos;s going to use it for the user using the application .
their own photos are going to be covered with airbnb who have another person .
if someone has done the hard job , and all of these sacred people have been labeled , and who they &apos;re all told , then my photo will suddenly fit with the emperor of the emperor of the data , and i can use it as a start to take the pictures of the other piece of social experience .
and of course , byproduct all of this are the immense rich models of each interesting part of the earth that &apos;s not just through the surface of the earth , and that &apos;s not just by the collective storage , but by collective memory .
thank you .
do i understand it right ? your software allows you to have a specific at a certain time in the next years , all the images that are used by someone in the world , in principle , in common ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t make anything else than discover .
if you want to build them , they &apos;re in the face of the images .
and it does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the amount of information that you have , which have many of these images .
as if you do a computer company for pictures , where you &apos;re building sentences and the text of the website , a lot of information that &apos;s the picture .
but how would it be , if the image you connected to all of your pictures ?
then the scope of the brain is the amount of space , and the abundance that make it really enormous . it &apos;s a classic classic .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , which i hope , in unison with other things , are you already hearing . and i &apos;m going to try to make some connections , if you &apos;re not noticed .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official &quot; official .
the official of what ?
the official of all western societies in the industrialized industrialized societies .
the official business system works like this : if our goal is to maximize the public &apos;s public , it &apos;s all about the freedom of freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom is good , valuable , meaningful , a sense of human desire for human .
if people have freedom , everybody is about us to do things for themselves , to do the things that our common lives and not to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply that it would not come to the sense of question .
and it &apos;s also deep in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress is about .
this is my supermarket . no big one .
i just want to say something about the talk about a little bit about the story .
there &apos;s an average world in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t have the 10 different extra extra extra extra extra extra , and 12 times you could buy it to make a big number of their own wounds , in which unlikely case , that no one &apos;s the british war in the store for you .
so this is how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the business business business to put a stereo -- speakers , a computer , a radio , radio , radio , the vitality , and in this one electronics , there are so many regular facilities .
we can put together millions of different regular plants in the components that are offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , you could have any phone , you &apos;d have to have a phone , as long as he came from derek bell .
they rented their phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
one of the things that was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
we have almost a infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is in the middle -- the middle of the street , and preferably , and preferably , and preferably recyclable sari .
and you should not have seen that in your business now , you can be sure that you &apos;ll soon be .
and what it does is it makes people run into the business and asking that question .
now , you know what the answer is to this question ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a cellphone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life , which are very important than buying things , the same explosion of choice is true .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor says , we could make a power or we could make b .
a has this benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has this benefits and risks and b has the benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not it . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patients autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , it &apos;s a shift of the burden of responsibility for someone who knows something of something -- the patient &apos;s -- -- -- -- -- the patient &apos;s -- to someone who &apos;s not in the best constitution -- mostly the patient .
there &apos;s an enormous marketing for prescription drugs for people like them and i , if they &apos;re thinking about it , not to make sense of it because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they advertise us when we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , you expect to call the doctor at the next morning and ask a change to ask .
something so profound about our identity is now a question of choice , how to show this slide .
we don &apos;t inherit identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re so often reinvent how we want .
that means that every day you wake up the morning , you need to decide what kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where the most human was that almost every one had one and that they got married as quickly as they could , and then they got them as fast as they could .
the only choice was &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did after that .
now , everything is easy to have .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;ll give you 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , ask yourself , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry ?
should i marry later ? should i have kids , or do i do a career ? &quot;
these are all the questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions regardless of whether that means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m going to give you , and not good note in my class .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important questions to be asked .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl shows , with the technology that allows us to work every minute of every place on the planet -- until the most prolific hotel .
there &apos;s a corner of the corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you about , which is the most powerful thing that i &apos;m going to do .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means is that this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions , again , again , and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can see our children playing with football , and we have our mobile phone on one hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our blackberry is probably on our lap .
and also , if you &apos;re all off , every minute we &apos;re in our child , we &apos;re also asking ourselves , &quot; should i be able to put this call ? &quot;
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and also , even though the answer to the question &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be your experience of the baby &apos;s child , very different than it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and little things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world in that we were living was so out .
so i want to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in which we live now looks like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to do something bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , a way of making it happen , is that he &apos;s going to make it happen .
so , with so many options you can choose , people are very hard to decide to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another more sophisticated example of this , a study of investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to the comic of the plastic , the giant plastic of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 of the 10 times that the employer were offered the employer , the participation around two percent .
they provide 50 percent of them -- 10 percent less employees than if they only provide five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 more basic ones that are the choice to get to the choice , it &apos;s so hard to put it on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , it never comes .
you know , that that &apos;s not just that people had to eat when they were going to go to retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to go to the back , it means that they &apos;re going to miss the decisions that they &apos;re missing .
and they &apos;re not participation by the age of 5,000 , a year of the most successful , who would have been happy to reproduce their contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of a lot of choices .
and i think it &apos;s going to make the world look like this .
they want to make the decision really , if it &apos;s for all the eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment fund , or even the wrong thing .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end up with less satisfaction with the outcome of choice than if we had the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
and there &apos;s several reasons for this .
one of them is , by the great choice of different kinds of information , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and that &apos;s just perfect , it &apos;s just a different decision to make that you have the decision , and what &apos;s going on is that it &apos;s going to be a different decision to make it regret , and what &apos;s going on is that it &apos;s going to be a more decision that &apos;s been made of the choice .
the more possibilities there are , the simpler it doesn &apos;t really have to regret the choice that they meet .
second , what economists call the military revolution .
dan gilbert has made a big point of this morning by telling how much the way we evaluate things , depends on what we &apos;re comparing .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternatives to consider , it &apos;s just attractive to imagine the underlying properties that they are doing , which makes them feel less happy with the alternatives that they have chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for the of you , that &apos;s not new york , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of the hamptons .
very expensive deep property .
beautiful beach . great day . you have it for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; damn &quot; the man thinks &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my inbox is gone .
i could park directly from my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks of the thought that he missed the possibility of the possibility , day , a great parking lot .
and the happiness rate is lower enough to get the happiness we &apos;ve got , even if what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more possibilities that we have to make the choice , the more attractive properties of these choices are going to take place .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon is a few people .
he &apos;s going to be a statement about living in the right now and maybe doing things slowly .
but a key point he &apos;s doing is , always who you &apos;re deciding for a thing , you don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things like a lot of attractive qualities , and it will be what they &apos;re going to do less powerful .
third , the expectations of expectations .
this has met me when i was practicing my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which it was just jeans , and they bought them , and they have bad sex , they were incredibly reactive and they were often covered enough enough and they &apos;ve been carrying enough enough , they started feeling &quot; ok . &quot;
so , to buy new jeans , after many years of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a few jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the officer said , &quot; do you want a smooth , easy or a big ?
do you want buttons or half ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you want to cut down far , you know , in fact , blah blah , blah -- &quot; and so on .
my jaw was down and after i recovered , i &apos;d like to have the way that i used to have the only way .
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour of all this damn jeans , and the business -- and i say the truth -- and i say the truth -- with the best jeans i ever had .
i had better . all these choices allowed me to have it better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try it to explain it .
the reason i felt worse was that i felt bad with all these options , my expectations for what a good pair of jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations than it was in a way .
when they came in 100 ways , it would have been perfect to have a perfect one .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i expected , and what i had was the expected thing to do in comparison to what i expected .
the alternative of human beings is inevitably increasing the expectations of people who have the people who have been going to be about how good these choices are going to be .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even though the results are good .
no one in the world of marketing knows this , because if you would , you know what it is like here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that it was all better than anything was worse than anything was worse than anything bad was to make people experience a pleasant surprise .
today in the world we live -- we wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best for that you can ever hope is so good as you would expect .
they &apos;re never going to be comfortable because their expectations , my expectations , are great .
the secret to the main system -- that &apos;s what they all came from -- the secret to the internet of the world are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short moment of time -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t have a lot of time .
but shut is not always a bad thing .
finally , one of the most powerful people sitting in a bad room , when there &apos;s only one kind of purchase , if you &apos;re a little bit of a break , and you ask yourself why , who is responsible , the answer is , what would you do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they &apos;re buying one of the rainy , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to the question : it .
they could have done it better .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the window , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , if people are making decisions , and even if the results of decisions are good , they &apos;re going to be disappointed .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant -- not the only , but a significant evolutionary model of depression , and also suicide , is that people have learned the disappointing because they &apos;re so high , and then they have to explain their fault .
and so the most important thing is that it &apos;s all more , an objective , and we feel bad .
so let me remind you .
this is the official business of that that we all think of right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s better than no , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choices than something more choices than something .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m quite sure that we &apos;ve missed this point for a long time to make our common lives .
now , as a rule -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a rule , the thing that is about thinking about it . what all these choices allow in the industrialized societies is wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them whose problem is not to be the big choice .
your problem is that you have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and angry : steve levitt has told you yesterday about how these expensive and hard car seats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that this expensive , complicated decision -- it &apos;s not easy to help you .
they even hurt .
they &apos;re worried about that , we &apos;re getting worse .
if something of what people do in our society are making decisions to the societies in people who have been able to make people move to people , not only would life improve , but we would also improve our dignity .
economists call this a drug application .
so , the point is that it &apos;s going to be all better -- not just the poor -- because all these big choices are all the way that we do all the way .
finally , read this cartoon , and , you know , a very disruptive person , says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know , you know , it &apos;s not possible in this kind of rock . &quot;
gifted imagination , a more powerful view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about it , the more i came to see the fish that the fish know .
because the truth is that if you break the internet , it &apos;s so much possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the water , it &apos;s so much possible , it &apos;s going to reduce happiness .
they increase paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a more powerful .
this is almost limited to limited security -- possibly for the fish , definitely for us .
but the most important thing about a metaphor of a metaphor of a metaphor is a recipe for misery , and i suspect , i think , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology and now we try to get from the digital code into a new phase of biology by creating new life and building .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask important questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something i think i think is a lot of biologists trying to understand and that on different levels .
we tried to make different approaches to it to simplify the minimum components .
we &apos;ve been digitized almost 20 years . when we sequenced the most prolific , the change of the analog world of biology is the digital world of biology .
now , let &apos;s try to ask if we can regenerate life or can we make new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a little organism , mycoplasma , which has the smallest genome of a species that has to replicate itself in the lab , and we tried to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it on a hundred genes of the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at this metabolic map that is very simple , compared to our mind , trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we look at all these genes we can eliminate one after the other , it &apos;s very unlikely to be able to do that .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to go forward this chromosome , which allows us to vary the individual components and so some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we get a chromosome down ?
does it really allow chemistry to make these really big molecules , which hasn &apos;t been done before ?
and , if we can , we can start that chromosome ?
a chromosome is just a piece of chemical material , by the way .
our steps in the fluorescence of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has evolved very slowly , but yet , our final point would be on an exponential curve now .
we started about 15 years ago .
it took a few years of starting to work with a research review before we did the first experiments .
and it turns out that it &apos;s very difficult to do .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make little bits of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a piece of a process that makes a piece of the piece , the more mistakes .
so we had to develop a new way of building these little pieces that we could put these little pieces together and fix the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x .
it &apos;s a little virus killing the bacteria .
we made small pieces , made a mistake error and a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of dna , and put it into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles then were released by the cells and then they went back and killed back to e. coli .
i talked about oil oil , and they said they were trying to understand this model .
they laughed more than they do here .
so we think that &apos;s a situation in the software actually can build its hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go far further . we wanted to build a whole universal chromosome , and it &apos;s more than a black letter of genetic code . so we thought we &apos;re building it in tapes of the size of the virus , which we could vary the size of the kind of tomato tissue to understand what the individual components are .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information really has to be accurate .
when we showed the genome at 1995 , the most violent thing was a mistake per 10,000 base base .
we found out the most successful 30 mistakes , if we had used the original sequence , it never had been possible .
part of the design is to create pieces of letters for 50 letters , and that &apos;s where you have to have a different amount of time to build smaller amounts of water to build smaller amounts of water .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built the wild .
think about it : we have a network of code : a , c , g , g and t.
so , the letters of this letter -- this letter opens about 20 amino acids ; and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
at first we only signed .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we &apos;ve designed the pieces that we could just easily divide them with enzymes , and there are enzymes that repair these and then gather it back .
and we started making pieces , starting with the five to the five of the letters , to put these together together to make these together , to try to restore these together , to the more sophisticated .
in every step , we have produced these pieces in the surplus that we could sequence them because we tried to create a very robust process what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we tried to get the point of the food system .
so , this looks like a computer &apos;s game .
if we get to these right big pieces -- with 100,000 base pairs -- then they &apos;re not going to be just growing in e. to the rest of the modern molecular molecular and so we used to connect other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism of the brain system that was used to repair biology to repair dna that can bring pieces of these pieces .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s a organism called the carbon , the three million rads of radiation in radiation .
you see the top field that its chromosome is just apart .
12 to 24 hours later , everything has put together like it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely dried , they can even be in a vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life exists in space and moving to aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa showed that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a key of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve been using it to have a very basic design of the pieces of the pieces we have , and we put it on , yeast adds this one together .
this is not a regular , regular blood game .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the internet system .
these are footage about a $ 6 hour .
this is the publication that we &apos;ve done recently .
these are about the most striking letters of the brain , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with a structure of the structure that has ever been created by people .
it has a more powerful of over 300 million .
if we would print it with a 10 and without distances of 10 and without distances , it would include the pages of the genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus , and it &apos;s much more complicated with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier if you &apos;re in the same way that we &apos;re going to do it , you just take the nucleus out and give you another in , and that &apos;s exactly what you all heard about the clone .
in the computer of the brain , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but only recently we showed that you can actually transplant a full transplant of a triangle to another and that can activate them .
we &apos;ve been displaced the chromosome of a carbon . roughly , these two things are like humans and mice . we gave a few of them to destroy the chromosome . we &apos;re going to put it with enzymes to destroy all the proteins . and it was very amazing to us , and it &apos;s really amazing to us .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that there &apos;s the end , but we tried to get the process to a little bit .
this is the most powerful of evolution here .
we &apos;re all finding species here , which have taken a second chromosome , or a third of the world &apos;s two , every time thousands of photos in just one second .
so people who think of evolution as a gene is being changed at a time , missing a lot of biology .
there are enzymes called the most primitive , which actually is called dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no ; the chromosomes we &apos;ve added already .
it was in the cell , and it was found the other chromosome as foreign material , and so we had a cell , and so we had a cell with a new chromosome .
it &apos;s the blue thing that we had added to the genes .
and after a very short time , it had lost all the characteristics of the species , and it completely converted into a new species of new zealand that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we have running running away .
it may sound like genomic design , but we can , by changing the world &apos;s data , changes quite dramatically .
now i argued that this is not the most powerful -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i argued that we may be able to create a new form of the cambrian explosion in which there could be massive new organizational explosion based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re in the next 40 billion people in the next 40 years , and we &apos;re in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context : i was born in the year .
today , three people in this planet are in 1946 for each of the year in 2100 , within 40 years , and in the age of 40 , it &apos;s been done .
we have problems with food , with fresh water , and we have a fresh water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
it will offer a challenge for nine .
we need about five billion tons of coal , solar dioxide billion barrels of oil , and these are a hundred million drums per day .
if we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there is all the co2 of this material that lands in the atmosphere .
we now have , from our discoveries from all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the most powerful of the future .
the main one had a dozen components and you see the diversity that came from that .
we &apos;re going to be able to be in the first line of the biological reality and the idea of our imagination .
we have technologies today because of this rapid , which we call the most of the things that we call genetics .
we have now the opportunity to build a big robot that can make millions of chromosomes a day .
if you imagine these 20 million different genes or to optimize these processes to get food or drugs , we can change with a little team more molecular biology than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just more inclusive selection , and we can go to the metal of plastic , production of chemicals or the other , and so on .
this is a shot of actual gas that we &apos;re working on , which is actually to sit down and design new species .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it will look like it , we know exactly how their genetic code will look like .
we &apos;re now focusing on fuel the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn farms recently , which is just a bad experiment .
we have fuel of the fuel and third generation that will come out relatively soon , the much higher levels of energy , how reduce food or different kinds of information .
but , as we think the only way of thinking about biology is a big impact without any other increase on food or the limitation of their availability , if we see co2 as a source of co2 , and therefore we work on cells that go to this path .
and we think we will be the first generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we all have different kinds of ways .
this is a organism that we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about a living mile , in almost a little bit of time , almost more than a lot of time .
it &apos;s turning co2 into methane to use hydrogen as a source of hydrogen .
we study whether we can use carbon dioxide , which could be just to be brought to the carbon dioxide , and they convert co2 to the fuel , to make this process .
in a short time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- we have -- the kind of goals like the substitute of the entire drip industry . right . if you could do that at ted , where else ?
but we &apos;re working on the same time that we &apos;re using these same approaches to the development of vaccines .
they saw it with flu , we &apos;re always a year back and a dollar to make a dollar when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by being able to create vaccines in the field of the field .
this is how the future might look like , with changes , can be accelerated today , and now , synthetic bacteria , and perhaps the most powerful .
we &apos;re moved light from people from that to better than we are , and our goal is that we have a chance to survive long enough to do that . thank you very much .
on the last ted conference , i gave a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so it &apos;s so far . and for all those who didn &apos;t exist there , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment that was ever been addressed -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that existed less than a second one in the universe -- and that to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we take images of these online centers in detectors .
i &apos;m working on this . he &apos;s called atlas detector -- 44 feet in the wide , 22 feet in diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction that you see the scale .
the 10th of september last year was the machine for the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it &apos;s made huge amounts of water in the control control .
it &apos;s a picture of the first , which is the entire route to put the lhc , then to be part of the lhc , to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this image on the 10th of september , we knew that the machine is working , which is a great triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this was created the biggest largest , or this , as someone who was visiting the google page and the front page .
it means we reached a cultural impact next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires -- this golden wires here .
these wires run the same , when the machine runs on the surface of the street .
now , the engineers are going to look at them and say , &quot; no , don &apos;t do it . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford to do that because if you &apos;re very cool , you &apos;ll be called the so-called carbon dioxide .
so , minus pisa , as the space between the stars , these wires can be able to adjust tension .
in one of the connections , between the surface of the triangle , there was a plastic set of ink .
so , it &apos;s suddenly heating the wires , and they suddenly have more resistant resistance .
this was the result .
now , all of this is wonderful if you imagine that the magnets weigh over 20 tons and it &apos;s turning around about 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we called them new , they &apos;re called .
they &apos;re all back to their way back to their way .
the lhc was going to be viable again .
we &apos;ll turn it down , and we &apos;ll expect the first data in june or july to collect our journey , and we &apos;ll go to the journey to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
well , of course , in a way of copying accidents , again , the debate of science and engineering at the borders of science , it &apos;s easy to reject .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to reach the fact that we are going beyond our limitations , is the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my final words , a english scientist , which is , i think , as i suspect when he &apos;s the most violent experiments of his life &apos;s worth , his apprentice , he said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind , when assume that our scientific ideas are in nature , that our scientific ideas are not in nature , that our scientific beliefs are in nature .
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
writing books is my job , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big life , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
but the recent thing is a recent thing in my life , and my career has happened to me that i have a complete idea to rethink my relationship .
this strange event was that i recently wrote a book -- a biography called the &quot; a biography , &quot; and love , love , love -- that decided to get out of some of my previous books in the world and a big , international , international , international , international power system .
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to get treated as if i &apos;m going to be the fall of the fall .
seriously -- the equator of the fall !
for example , you &apos;re going to get to me , and say , &quot; don &apos;t you fear that you never will ever be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be that success ?
don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re going to have your whole life , and never again create a book that anyone in the world is interested in ?
okay , that &apos;s really what makes you courage .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was talking about 20 years ago when i was a teenager to be a teenager , i wanted to be a writer with the same kind of thing that i had had the same kind of thing .
people said , &quot; did you have no fear , never succeed ? &quot;
did you not fear the humiliation of a letter ?
you don &apos;t have a fear that you &apos;re going to take your life for your life and never get something out there and that you &apos;re going to die on a football accident -- your mouth filled with the bitter ashes of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer to all these questions is : the short answer to all of these questions is : yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i always had .
and i &apos;m more afraid of fear that nobody would be a burden of .
like algae -- and other scary things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i think about it for recently and question , why ?
is that sensible ?
is it logical that by someone who should be expected to do that , the work that he feels really is being informed ?
and what &apos;s going on with the creative enterprise that they &apos;re encouraged us to do about the related state -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemists and i can &apos;t remember the situation in his 40 years than he asked if he was scared to be chemist .
with your favorite company , john -- how do you do it ?
it just didn &apos;t come , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not come to the african press , people who have been receiving the reputation of the internet .
we seem to have a writer that we have , but not only the writers , but not only the writers , but the creative allen , they seem to have to be mentally unstable .
all you need to do is look at the bitter of the really great head of really great minds of the 20th century , the young and often died of your own hand .
and even the ones that don &apos;t actually have been able to do that , actually seemed to be charged by their talents , really neglected by their talents .
norman mandelbrot said a little bit before his death in his last interview : in my last interview , i had a little bit of killing myself .
an extraordinary statement that you can do about your life work .
but we didn &apos;t even know if we hear somebody like this , because we &apos;ve seen this kind of statements since so long ago . somehow we have the notion of that as long as we have , and that art is kind of engaging , and that art -- the end of the -- always leads to the most important .
the question i want to ask you today is : is this idea of it all right ?
you feel like this ? because with only one centimeter distance -- i &apos;m not comfortable with this notion of thinking .
i think they &apos;re all the way .
and i think they &apos;re dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how they &apos;re taken into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better when we live our great creative endeavor .
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start , this dark path of the meaning of the kind of thing that i &apos;m in my career is , especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career .
this is -- look , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 more popular school .
and it &apos;s very likely to be that everything i &apos;m going to talk about now is the world &apos;s work as the work that &apos;s been made for the success of my last book , right ?
i say it , because we &apos;re all kind of friends here , and it &apos;s really likely to be my greatest success behind me .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts that someone can get to get nine o &apos;clock in the morning , drink gin . and i don &apos;t want to .
i would prefer to do this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time of the most powerful , i seem to be able to write to write , a kind of a kind of a kind of a random psychological kind of psychological thing .
somehow i have to find out of a way to get a sense of writing a safe distance between me and my very natural , and i think about how the reaction is going to be on writing .
while i &apos;ve been looking for models in the last year to do this , i also went to find out the past and i tried to find other societies to see if they might have better or more of the ideas that are related to creativity .
this quest to take me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will come back again .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of meritocratic , a kind of a meritocratic , unknown source to people coming from a distant , unknown source .
the greeks were calling these divine folk voices of creativity to creativity .
by socrates , he believed that he believed he had a baby who had to come from the distance to him .
the roman had the same idea , called this kind of kind of creative creative mind , a genius of creative mind .
this is great . the roman didn &apos;t really thought that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magic unacceptable creature , which was that it was literally in the walls of a football -- about the way that the most powerful and the artists were doing the work of the work .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s it , because it &apos;s the distance i talked about -- the psychological construct that protect you from the following of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked like this , right ?
the artist &apos;s artist was protected in a little bit of a sense , like , for example , too much bribe , right ?
if you were brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at all of you for a hundred year-old , and everybody knew you had this kind of a genius that helped you .
if your work is going to be , not completely your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew her genius was something paralyzed .
so the people in the west really thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance came and all changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- all gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no more to the mystic creatures that are going to take orders from the divine .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational fertilization and people started thinking that creativity was completely from individual individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people who call this or the artists , and they call a genius , instead of that he has a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think to allow a naked person , that he thinks he or it &apos;s like the vessel , like the pelvis and the the source of all the divine and the most honest and the source of all the divine , the human psyche , is a little bit too much responsibility to make a human psyche .
it &apos;s like asking someone to eat the sun .
and the ticking and a distorted whole egos and it creates all of these daycare expectations of success .
i think that this is the most powerful thing that we &apos;ve been attracted to the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe an ancient understanding of the relationship between people and the mystery of creative return .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just eradicate the growth of 500 years of rational fertilization in a very much of a second talk .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience who would say , really , really , really , really , really , really , the scientific scientific doubt , which is , basically -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- the people who are doing success and they &apos;re using their projects on their projects and so forth .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question i want to address is , why not ?
why not think about it ?
because it &apos;s the same sense that it &apos;s just as much sense of everything i &apos;ve heard about when it was about the absolute crazy of the creative process .
a process that &apos;s going to be -- like everyone who has ever tried to do something -- so in other words : in other words , everybody here -- not always compassion .
in fact , he can feel really natural .
i had a way to hit the same kind of the extraordinary poet poet , which is now about 90 , but she was a whole life for the long poet , and she told me that she was growing up in the middle of virginia , she said she would feel and hear how a poem is about the landscape of the landscape .
she would be like a train train from air .
the country would be on the land .
she felt , because it would come , because it would bring the earth under the earthquake .
she knew that she was able to do one of these times in a moment , and that was -- in her words -- the heck of the devil , the heck of the devil .
she ran like the devil to the house as she was tracking from this poem , and it was just that she was fast enough to get a sheet of paper and a pen that had to get it when it was wrapped up by the shortcut , catching and on the sheet .
in other words , she didn &apos;t get fast enough , and she ran and ran and ran the house , and she didn &apos;t get the house and i didn &apos;t give it to the house , and she would say -- it would go to the country , and i would say -- he would go to a different poet .
and then there were these moments -- the part i never forget -- she said that there were moments where they were almost missed it .
so , she goes to the house and looking for paper and the poem through her and she &apos;s getting a pen just as it &apos;s made by them and then -- she said -- it was like this with her other hand and getting it to get it .
she caught the poem on his tail and moved it back into your body and took it on the sheet of paper .
and this is the opportunity that the poem came up with , and it &apos;s intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
when i heard that , i was very fond of this -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is going to be .
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a training professor . i have to get up to the same time , and i have to sweat every day , and i &apos;m really uncomfortable with it , really awkward .
but even i have a little more reflective thing sometimes in my college lab .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
even i had work or ideas that made out of a source of me that i really don &apos;t really identify .
what is this thing ?
and how do we deal with losing our minds with our minds , but to keep ourselves in the opposite of mental health ?
for me , the best living example is how to do this , the musicians tom &apos;s ability to interview him a few years ago .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of his life was tom the embodiment of the modern artist who tried to master these miniature creative impulses that lived in his day , and they &apos;re working with them .
but then he became older and quiet . he told me that he was going to go on a dent in los angeles , and it changed everything for him .
he went with high speed than he suddenly hears a little fragment of a melody , which is how it &apos;s often been a lot of a difficult effect , and he wants to have it . he &apos;s going to be able to hold it . he can &apos;t put it in .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil , he doesn &apos;t have a pencil .
so he starts , this old thing in him , and he &apos;s going to go back like this , like , &quot; i &apos;m going to lose this thing and get to be applied by this song forever . &quot;
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t .
but instead of getting out of panic , he just heard .
he ended up the whole meeting and did something completely new .
he just looked at the sky and said , &quot; sorry , can you see that i drive car ? &quot;
so , i think of the way i could just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a moment of a moment when i can take care of you .
if not , somebody else is going to be .
go and roll cohen cohen .
his whole process has changed after that .
not the work itself . it was still as dark as the same as ever as it was .
but the process and the heavy design system that surrounds him was to get out of where he was in trouble , where he was not going to be in trouble and he got out where he was in the way that he was in a way that he had no idea of the , no matter .
it could give a strange , surprising , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the stranger , brilliant thing that was not tom .
as i heard this story , it also changed a little bit like i worked and it has been saved by me .
this idea of me as i was in the middle of the street of the street , the u.s. war , was the love of the failure , and i fell into one of these threads that we all fall when we work on something and not work . you &apos;re going to think that it &apos;s going to be a disaster .
not just bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just be able to get the project out of it .
but then i remembered how tom had spoken in the free sky and i tried to do it .
so i took my view from the manuscript and i spoke to my comment towards a blank corner of the room .
i was talking about it , and i &apos;m talking , you know , you , you and i know both if this book is not brilliant , it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i &apos;m going to invest everything i have , i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to pop up here and follow your proportion .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , you know , the hell .
i &apos;m going to write on , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you a report that i was here for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like follows . centuries of people have been exposed to the desert in the deserts of the world , and they &apos;ve gathered out to be a lot of the people who were left for hours -- until dawn .
these strong were great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , very rare , something special happened . one of the actors was actually got a huge way of doing .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen this performance in your life once .
it was as if the time was going to be the time and the dancer through a kind of a kind of a kind of a plastic form , and he did nothing else than he ever did -- 1,000 nights before , but all added together .
and suddenly he didn &apos;t get in human history .
he was lit up by the inside and down and down and everything that was a unacceptable fire .
as something that happened then , people knew what was that . they called it his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : the shah , jagger , allah , , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historical of the world , when the u.s. boomers came out of the road , they had this practice with the centuries of the world , the aurochs changed over the centuries of the marine hybridization , belshazzar , manipulative , the biotech , which is still the most powerful and more friendly , and he sounds like that .
if a performer in spain is doing something impossible , something magical did : the biotech mentality , the brain , the brain , the brain , the great , educated , amazing , educated , educated , and it &apos;s a glimpse of god .
and that &apos;s great , because we need it .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning , when the dancers wake up and recognizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he doesn &apos;t have a more a joint of god in himself .
he &apos;s just an aging knee with a blood attack , and maybe he will never again go back to those heights .
and maybe someone will never call up the name of god , but what &apos;s going to be like , what about the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most powerful numerical views of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite like whiskey , if you didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of your existence of them were .
if you may just think that you &apos;re a bribe -- from a spectacular source for a time of your life , that &apos;s passed on someone else , when you &apos;re done with it .
if we start thinking about it , it changes all .
so i started thinking and i think i think about security in the past few months , while i was working on the book , that &apos;s going to be a little bit of -- when dangerous , scary , strong , the expected , very expected , the expected , very expected , the expected , very expected , my favorite thing .
what i &apos;ve got to say constantly , if i &apos;m going to get crazy , is not fear .
not a clue .
do your job .
it &apos;s still for your contribution to your contribution , whatever it is .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the stupid divine genius , that you get to the side , you decide to be a little bit of a sudden of wonder through your effort , then the more powerful thing about your effort .
and if not , dance still your dance .
and the most powerful thing about you , despite all of you .
i think it &apos;s a feeling , and i feel that we should teach .
and the most powerful thing about it is , despite you , just for you , just for you , you just have a human love and the most powerful , for you to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
the question .
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic state of the arctic , which had almost three million years of the size of the lower 48 states , has wiped out 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t push very strong enough the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of ice .
in a certain sense , the arctic state is the gateway heart of our global health system .
it grows in winter and it &apos;s freezing in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a little bit of a research of what happened in the last 25 years .
the most powerful is with red .
as you can see , it &apos;s kind of determined to do the dark dark , and this is the annual ice in winter , and it &apos;s drifting in summer .
this so-called the so-called , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which is from the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here .
this is a problem , because warming is the frozen reason to put the arctic ocean into the arctic ocean , which is if you have a lot of carbon dioxide , which is when it &apos;s going to be done , from microbes to methane .
compared to the whole amount of time , compared to the whole amount of time , it could double this amount , if we cross this critical point .
now , in some flat lakes today in alaska , in some flat lakes of itself .
professor merchant walter &apos;s university in alaska , with another new sea , traveled to another flat lake last winter .
wow !
you &apos;re good . the question is , how will it tell us the other person .
and one reason is , this enormous heat blows out of the north .
this is a year of a year .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is the most powerful river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how sea level goes up through the surface of the world , you will go into the ocean .
these rivers take a rapid basis .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest largest design system on the planet .
last month , researchers reported that the entire continent has a negative fuel rate .
and the most important thing that showed you about a few of the things is particularly central in the melt forest .
this is 20 feet deep , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the most powerful , the sun &apos;s new lakes , you see new lakes that were a few years ago .
40 percent of all people on the world get half of their family &apos;s disease .
in the andean , this glacier is the most powerful for this city .
the most prolific ones have been expanding .
but if you &apos;re going to get out of the water , most of the water is dropped .
in california , a 40 percent reduction in the sierra union was seen .
this is beyond the most violent .
and the predictions , as they read they are , are serious .
this is a dramatic increase in the entire world to fire a dramatic increase .
and the disasters everywhere in the world have never been an unprecedented and unprecedented degree of the world .
four times in the last 30 years like the most respected spasm .
this is a completely valid of the brain .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it &apos;s going to be .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve produced 70 million tons of co2 all 24 hours of co2 every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific right , the american continent , and in the united states , where there is a universal decline of the oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest single factor of global warming , besides deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning by fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most peaceful problem .
the united states is one of the largest largest oil systems , together with china .
and the suggestion was to build many more of the other more sophisticated .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that were thrown in the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
so , there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the most powerful and the most violent one has spent a dollar dollar last last day to provide clean coal , which is a contradiction .
this picture reminded me of something .
at christmas , at christmas , i went home in tennessee , a billion tons of carbon .
they &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is in our entire country of the world &apos;s land of america .
this happened to be christmas .
one of the commercials of the world &apos;s favorite thing was that .
the most violent thing is a very , happy guy .
there &apos;s a lot of it in the skin and abundance of america , and it helps to grow our economy .
the most powerful , the most powerful one is going to be clean .
it &apos;s affordable and it &apos;s more affordable , and workers stay in loans and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful most powerful thing is the leader of the internet &apos;s book .
let me tell you a very clear thing . al gore , nancy mandelbrot , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate protection has started to live in life .
this is one of them , part of them .
and in the most violent , climate change , we see climate change as a serious danger .
so we put it on the top of the day , to spend a significant economic policy to bring a more significant one to get the truth on the road , to the truth .
the fact is , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and also smells good .
so , don &apos;t worry about climate change .
let &apos;s leave you with that .
coal coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean piano system .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean water .
and yet , the burning of coal is the most important for global warming , which is remarkable clean , which you see here , changes everything .
look at it precisely , this is the right today , clean water .
finally , the positive alternative of our economic challenge and our challenge of the national security system .
america is in crisis , the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that all connects this together is our dependence from the fuel of the fuel as dirty coal and the dirty oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to make us look out of this kind of thing .
the u.s. is new percent of the clean electricity within the next 10 years .
a plan , to bring america back to work , make us safer and help to stop global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough is to solve our problems .
the u.s. &apos;s new american , find out more .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a military of america .
one of the fastest ways that our dependence from old , dirty fuels , which are bound to reduce our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to make good money better .
the u.s. &apos;s americas is new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african adage : &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
we have to get far , and that &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start to ask you to get the time of your childhood , when you played with a computer game .
while they realized how to remove the hands and make the sound , the most powerful and move , they actually learned to think and make problems through understanding and change the relationship and change the relationship and change the connections .
the spatial thinking is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a computer scientist , inspired by the kind of our interaction with real objects -- with my favorite computer , and my colleagues , i started to wonder , what if we were using computers , which is a digital health system , which is a digital health system , which is , what if we could make it , and how do we want to make it ?
this question was so empowering that we decided to study the answer and developed the solution .
and shortly , a computer designer is a very interactive computer in the size of a football system .
you can move with your hand , you can see each other , you can detect your movements and you have a screen and a brick .
much more importantly : are are physically , why you can only get it out of your hands and access it to your hands .
and the most important generation of a new generation of design is a new generation of data to manipulation digital data .
and if these tools are becoming physical and a conscious awareness for their movements , they can see each other and the edges of our brain systems with them , we can start to explore new and entertaining .
i start with some simple examples .
this is the most powerful thing for the most violent , and when i go to a direction , the video will go forward ; if i go to the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other true .
so if i put them next to them , they make interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the people , you can notice that and you can get a little nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and their tendency .
one interesting episode of the interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures to data , like color to make it like that , how to do it with fluid .
in this case , we have three main centers as a computer designer , and i can use it to assemble color into the middle of the middle where they &apos;re mixed up .
if we keep it on , we can make a little bit more of a space .
there are also some nice ways of doing this in education like languages , mathematics or corporate , where we give people the opportunity to get fast to try and see the results .
here i am ... this is a fibonacci series that i &apos;m making with a simple kind of a little bit of a basic design .
this is a game with words that is kind of a mixture of a mixture of the and the brain .
basically , you get every round of every round of the cloud , and you &apos;re trying to form words , and you &apos;re going to be tested with a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , they become mixed and you have a new set of plastic and new possibilities .
thank you .
these are some kids who were on a trip to the media lab , and i could move it to it , try and get a video of it .
they really loved it .
a more interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
everything you have to say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people who test it .
this is our youngest business of the bottom right there .
it turns out he was just going to stack up the world &apos;s test .
so for him , they were just a little bit more inclusive .
this is an interactive computer .
we wanted to develop a design system for the design system .
this is the amur ridge .
he can bring new characters in the scene by putting the back of the table , which shows this character .
here he is going to be the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he &apos;s going to get a tractor in the scene .
the orange senator .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the most prolific , and you can put them on side , and then put the characters on ...
... his own story .
hi !
it &apos;s a story with open end and it can decide how to evolve .
flying cat .
the last example i &apos;ve got today to show you , is a video of research for the game of a game that we &apos;ve developed recently and in the most violent than sound , as a sound , bass and drums .
each one has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
and you can put these notes into the sequence , which you can put in any patterns .
and you &apos;re going to be able to do it by just putting a stick on a car .
there are effects that you can change live , like hall and filters .
you connect it with a particular note and it &apos;s then to put it into the schedule .
and then even more accelerated effects like speed and volume that you can apply to the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s look at .
we start in the world &apos;s most productive , and we &apos;re going to distribute these in a series of a series , extend it and add a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do some drums .
and now i &apos;m going to pull the filter with the drums so i can steer the effect live .
i can speed the whole sequence by the way that i hit the speed of one or another direction .
and now i &apos;m going to pull the filter with the bass , for something more expression .
i can change the sequence as it &apos;s going .
so , i don &apos;t have to plan them to do it in the front line , but it can make it improvise ; they &apos;re extending it or more .
and finally , i can choose all the sequence , by looking at the most dramatic to left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my desire is to develop new design tools that can make better sense of how our brains and bodies work .
and today i had time to show you a part of this new design and some of the possibilities that we work in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you to the way that we &apos;re going to do this is that we &apos;re on the verge of the new generation of the interaction to the interaction of the digital media , which is the information that we have in our world .
thank you .
i &apos;m delighted to talk to you all .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m delighted to be there .
yeah , so what should be more nuanced ?
i just have to go back a little bit , and that &apos;s busy , and it &apos;s a lot of time to get around with modern molecular molecular biology .
i study molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been looking at molecular science , and i &apos;ve been looking at the most dramatic , and i &apos;ve been trying to do it because i wanted to know , and it wanted to do it even even what i learned in the study of theoretical theory .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity and i wanted to get closer to the matter of that matter .
i think that the molecular biology in general now is , in general , biotechnology , everything you count to it , synthetic biology and so on , etc .
extremely important , now , already , and much more importantly , is going to be in the future .
there &apos;s so controversial things like this all the way that they genetically changed the plants .
now there were craig venter in the prison industry , which is trying to make the fuel of algae , so gas from algae .
there &apos;s also things that we &apos;ve seen in the everyday world , which is most people not aware of , for example , the most important , for example , to wash us with 40 degrees laundry , also genetically enzymes .
and the list can continue on the front .
and so from the interest of this , i &apos;m on this technology , i &apos;m going to continue to keep on the road .
so what &apos;s the thing that &apos;s called hacking ?
most people know the most people from the most violent .
computers are recycling , and then it &apos;s going to be in the media , yes , the hackers break somewhere somewhere and claws and so on .
this is kind of a very sad thing for the most powerful , because it doesn &apos;t really do what it actually has started , and what &apos;s actually going on behind it .
and that &apos;s the most important thing , in the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , and it &apos;s also created the internet .
and it &apos;s about solving a playful , creative , original way to solve a problem .
and problem , that &apos;s not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can just be a more powerful thing , which is how things simplify , and then one of the things you can do , and how can you do that ?
and it was just a little bit easier to do with software , but there &apos;s also in the field of the brain , there &apos;s a whole whole bunch of water that &apos;s going to make all sorts of things in the wild .
and now , even in the direction of biology , and i want to take this metaphor , which is the comparison of synthetic biology , that biology is actually a very abstract , because , the most dynamic code is a more abstract code , which is not just the same as computers , and it &apos;s not just the same thing that is the same thing that is the same .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also code to code and it can also be a bit more powerful , and that &apos;s what i found , and i thought i &apos;d be incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper with it .
it &apos;s actually just two of the only way that we did it , that these networks .
there &apos;s a broken dotcom cap , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with cooperation , and with cooperation , and in india , we have a living in the world , and now there &apos;s some active people everywhere .
these are the more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and collaboration with scientists with this , and to ask questions about these technologies , and to start to make questions and to make it creative , and there &apos;s a lot of things .
but it &apos;s actually about finding such a kind of a kind of a kind of a practical access to that , to have an playful deal .
and then there &apos;s a dried railroad cap , the water strip .
this is a network of the network that &apos;s actually more like a kind of forum where you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be discussing and discussing online .
these are a little bit of a technical and a little bit more sophisticated , and then they &apos;re also going to ask , yes , immediately , say .
and based on this networks that have made the whole popular popular , it &apos;s a scene that i want to do , just as a result of social .
here in the picture , you see the top on the left , which is a kind of a , which is a kind of a school , so basically a school , a school school , a nonprofit school institution , where everybody can do that .
children , old , all kinds of people , to just try to engage with it , they have a lab in the lab , and look at what can do when these things are .
here &apos;s a group on the left , in indonesia , which is the one that is , but there &apos;s a lot of time .
more than these two networks .
and the people also are in such an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , also also , and combine it in quite a fairly noisy way .
one group of ankara that i met a while ago , that &apos;s a little bit more , that &apos;s a little bit more , the public would like to convey more to what they &apos;re learning in college , and they &apos;ve tried to explain what &apos;s going on in college .
and i have a lecture in the other image in copenhagen in the medical museum in a combination of the medical museum in combination with a show .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s mostly a very young man , but the only thing that is actually going to do is that the fascination of what all of us are doing is this fascination to the technology .
and what you can do with that , and also , in the way , do it , and to ask , well , what do you know , what do you want to do , you know what you want to do with it ?
so , okay , now to translate biology , you need some kind of material .
you need biological materials , and you need to have tools , and it &apos;s a lab .
or , in fact , what you normally understand in a lab that are kind of like the kind of stuff that &apos;s kind of a kind of light machine , extremely expensive , extremely , very , very , very , very , very disruptive , trained academics and so on .
and our approach was to say , okay , that actually , you have to do that .
it &apos;s actually not necessary because every every single person has actually evolved , actually , technology as most of the time , which is really like that .
and the o ones with this premise with this premise , for example , brian mcchrystal tried to put a team of money in england , and then put a satellite tag , and i &apos;d like to put a satellite , and then , you know , also grown up and also reproduce bacteria , worked with it .
so every time you have a soup of soup that he has left for too long , it &apos;s done again .
i &apos;ve tried to do this in my lab , a little bit of scale , and then i would take a little bit of the way to put on ebay and put a little bit of a little bit of a time , so that &apos;s the same as a test of the car , and then to make a test , so the same thing is the same .
this is actually not a joke to be a joke .
here &apos;s the picture in the picture , you see the lab , in the lab , so that &apos;s a kind of a garage garage with the same kind of thing that the college has been in paris , which has a group of the college that has been put in the university of what has been put in and quite interesting , and i want to just make a project for a second .
and this is a little bit of a , which is just mentioned , and this is what kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of thing for molecular biology .
and yes , so you see , it &apos;s relatively relatively diverse , so there &apos;s a lot of people who are doing that in home , until far larger organizations that are going to be doing more and more of the other , in the form of the form of the form .
but always the way that it &apos;s always the approach that it &apos;s just going to be and accessible .
the first project we &apos;ve done as an international group , when we were sort of aware of ourselves , is there are now us now as a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re familiar with people who always are more eager to be there and so .
and then , from the most violent website , the founder of the founder , and said , well , we have to actually meet ourselves , also make it real , and then put two events , and then put two points in the back of the street , in san francisco , and in the very early days , in san francisco .
and then , there was also about that , yes , who are we , what do we want to do , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values and what are our environmental purposes , our foundation , our foundation ?
and then we &apos;ve been working on a business problem .
that was pretty intuitive , so everybody just has his wish , and that &apos;s what it does , and then , you know , you know .
and there was , i think , a pretty good code .
and then we have this , and that &apos;s not unacceptable , but that &apos;s , i think , has been pretty good , that people are quite convinced about that .
and we actually tried to do that in academic history , but it &apos;s kind of not that way .
so i think we &apos;re in the way that we &apos;re in the way that we &apos;re going to have a step further than the academic world .
yes , what projects do we actually do now ?
a project i &apos;ve done with the ted company in switzerland , was that we wanted to build a so-called optical event or optical outliers .
this is when you focus a laser beam on a space , you can catch little particles in the air or in the liquid and then move in that focus , so , that &apos;s captured , so that &apos;s a kind of a kind of a business of a game in principle .
this really works , that &apos;s done in academic science , and we thought , okay , we might get that , we &apos;d have taken a webcam , the lens , the lens , the lens , the lens , you have a microscope , you can see it &apos;s going to be a microscope .
this is what you see down there .
and then we have a laser browser , and we got a torch , and the torch was out there , and then tries to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , it &apos;s not true , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of it .
so another project that comes from the french group from paris , that &apos;s been worked , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and it &apos;s so much , so a kind of a , such thing , so a kind of a business , so that it &apos;s like a little bit , so it &apos;s been a little bit of a research , so it &apos;s sam , his name is sam &apos;s , sam &apos;s , his name .
he then has this helmet built this helmet , and in cooperation with the museum , that was running .
and then the visitors could go in the room , sit on this chair , put this helmet on .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought or how they thought they were , and they were different lights in the room .
was a pretty nice project .
another thing from the united states , which has just been to do with this kind of thing , is that the most reliable , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , to reproduce , to reproduce , to reproduce , to make fragments , so you can make it visible .
so if i do this , the most popular thing about the scene , then you go to see any more plastic , and then the one that you do , you can say , and then you can say , okay , this hair belongs to this person , so .
and the machines that are doing something like this is pretty expensive , which is the kind of a commercial , which is the least appropriate to go to the average of the age of the age .
and that &apos;s not the case of the game , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be a lot of .
so this is just an application of many , which can do it .
and they have the two builders who have been told and said , okay , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and then they have open source , and then they &apos;re just free , and they &apos;re now the cheapest vendor of these devices , and they &apos;re now the cheapest vendor of these devices .
i think somehow , so six hundred dollars or something .
but in any case , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s in a frame where it &apos;s clearly available to where it is available .
so it &apos;s a very , very talkative hack .
a project i started to do was build a computer company .
so , the way that it &apos;s like a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of thing that &apos;s going to take , like , take two centimeters or something like that .
you put it on the street , and you put the water on the street , and then i put the back on the onion , and then i put the back to the onion and then put it on the street .
so the device you see there is not working .
but this is my prototype , but that &apos;s pretty little looked like this , so on a branch that &apos;s on the , and the thing that was on the ground , electronics , and it was the pressure , and that was the pressure to break .
and then i took a test of a video and i put that together .
a key thing when you do the full of water , the amount of pressure , so i think , so 40 to the bar , i think , is about the speed of the bar .
and then you can speed up the particles very enough and then go to the onion .
and the commercial device costs about the equivalent of a mile , or something like that , to the 50 .
so it &apos;s not the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically doable in it .
so , this is the moment that the core point is the core point of the scene , and that availability of technology , and the information and the information system , that more people can get involved there .
because , as i said , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little clue about it , and also not a chance to make it really good .
because if you just read about it , you &apos;re not the same thing , like if you did it yourself or you &apos;ve seen it .
and i think technology is becoming more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to make good citizens in the society , and you want to be able to engage in society , and you want to join the access to knowledge and the technology .
and you have to do it and understand it to make it and understand it .
and then the most powerful thing that &apos;s going on under the bottom of the ocean and citizen science .
so , as citizens , they &apos;re being able to get into the situation , just to get into this scientific technology .
and this is the core core of the core .
these are the people who officially officially officially submitted to the website , and they &apos;re a website .
this is already a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and interesting is also , they &apos;re represented in southeast asia .
this is what i think is there , there are fewer people being pushed up than actually .
so i know some of the things that don &apos;t have a fit .
and these are just the beaver , the individual people .
in part , in part of these , these places , they put together .
and that &apos;s very beginning .
like , i &apos;ve got it just started .
and so , the most powerful , the most popular , the most powerful , the first , the most powerful .
and this is now a gigantic network of very good , yes , the world &apos;s largest , which is a place that &apos;s represented everywhere on the world .
and we hope that we &apos;re going to be able to look at it , and then we &apos;re also very good at all the way that we &apos;re going to be able to get more and more connected , so that it can be more people involved in the world .
and i would invite everybody to deal with this and even try and try and test .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not impossible when you have enough curiosity , and you get enough energy , you &apos;re also going to get there .
thank you very much for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hi .
how do we actually work ?
this is a question that i &apos;m very moved to as designers , but also in the realm of the field of the field , and in the field of user , in the field of user .
it &apos;s about how to put people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and make them a very much more powerful experience .
because i think that the interactive media in us , cognitive models , are mapping in our biological memory , so that it has been exploited very , very long ago , and that we can just be able to be able to be able to be able to do that through interactive media .
and that &apos;s very amazing because you actually believe that these are the most powerful , which you &apos;re doing , that you actually get a way to get the future , but actually it &apos;s that the future is exactly in our own way of our own roots .
what are the most powerful models now ?
i &apos;ve got four main days writing , and i &apos;d like to explain to you a little bit about it .
to the cognitive models , and that &apos;s the models that we have in the richest times , which we have adapted to .
and to these more precise models , we &apos;ve heard that we have a natural relationship to virtuality .
that sounds like this , basically , unusual .
but i &apos;m going to go back to this , and i &apos;ll prove you to try and prove that you have a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second aspect is that since this particular period of communication , we &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to be able to talk about this very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very thorny language .
and the third area , which explains , actually , is itself .
we all know that the interactive media is in definition , which is the denial of the gap , and of course , what we &apos;re saying is that we &apos;re facing the gap today as normal .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of the world &apos;s life .
now , as is now with the mit virtuality , the most nature of the world is actually the most nature .
i want to show you this .
how many doors did the house go in which they live ?
and that &apos;s not what we &apos;re going to do to tell you immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s happening right now .
they go through the spirit of this house , in the eastern world , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what you do .
they &apos;re the reality of the reality , and they &apos;re very without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and there we are going to be struggling for the virtual reality to put the virtual reality in our online technology , so we can actually do that all the time .
and this wealth that the virtual reality is to make the reality of the world , which have also needed the people in the richest times , because they didn &apos;t have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any control system .
they had no mass media .
the only thing that had been , was her head .
and in this head , memory was played .
in this head , we know , and with this virtual images , the imagination , the imagination , was also passed up .
and so it &apos;s also so strong in us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
the interesting thing about it is , if i can make a little trip .
yeah , that &apos;s what .
the interesting thing about this is that at that time of human beings , the same thing was the same thing that &apos;s been happening .
now , if you think of a piece of pieces now .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i &apos;ll come back to talk about that again .
the core tool has been the same for stories since it has been done .
and the preacher , priests , so-called the more subtle , were extra warning to preserve knowledge in stories .
and we also are still very , very strong stories .
the author of the book the chief river , jonathan , and we &apos;re still starting to go back a year with the most violent hours of stories .
this means for a child that &apos;s spent to reach the most of the time of the most of the time with the most violent of stories .
now we think of our love of stories depends on us as a child on our parents .
no , no , missing .
this is a lot further back , in the main world &apos;s cultures .
but for me , in the realm of interactive media as particularly impressive , we have been exploring by accidents in our biological memory , the ability to think about .
i brought you one example of the north american tribe of the u.s. population .
and life lived in the coastal world of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very , very simplistic area , and you had to navigate there , from island to island to get food .
and they did this with the so-called so-called the so-called &quot; the design . &quot;
you may know , if you &apos;re interested in this , you know , if you &apos;re interested in the australian american .
they have similar principles .
they have no software , but they have used that kind of stuff , or they have the same as a result of the same .
and what that interesting is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be mapped to songs .
and with the language that was the language of the language .
that means you &apos;re talking about sound and rhythm .
and this sounds and the rhythm , the topography of a region , shown the topography of a region and obviously enabled that you could get these songs together and put it in different places , and then move back to the left , and then move back to the left and then move back to the street .
why don &apos;t we sing to come from the top to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s actually happening ?
this is what &apos;s happening as a child &apos;s machine .
we &apos;ve moved in the so-called so-called the so-called business system .
it &apos;s the machine , and it &apos;s happened , and it &apos;s the book , and it &apos;s the most powerful thing .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and the own production of our individual memories .
on the book and on the picture .
so unfortunately , we have god &apos;s head to be a piece of water .
virtuality has become alien for us , and has nothing to do with reality .
bruce brown , a well-known white designer on the street , is so far to say that this mass of mass media , he says the book and the image , so not television , and so on , the internet , and so on , we have a media problem , and our ability to be able to be able to be transported to our own life system .
let &apos;s make a little bit of a plastic .
the launch of the machine .
what has the connections on our thinking and our memory system ?
then the main thing is the gravitational influence of the richest cultures .
and they &apos;re going to have been more and more of the way over the centuries and more more of the stuff that &apos;s been done by the impact .
that means that instead of remembering us , we have a standard of common , widespread patterns , in mass pathways that we can depend on our personal memories .
we &apos;re not producing more ourselves .
we have an abstract language .
we don &apos;t think of the thing that we &apos;re doing in pictures of things , but we &apos;re going to bring them to our language .
we &apos;ve been used to that things are linear .
and we have the punchline as a law , and there &apos;s only exceptions , like the most violent .
what &apos;s left is the most powerful thing we &apos;ve got .
we &apos;re still being arrested as a computer designer , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s coming ?
we had the most powerful , we had the machine , and we &apos;re going to go and go and take this so-called so-called the so-called so-called the so-called .
this sounds very much more powerful and sounds very much about science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of the internet design that bring us these opportunities back to our skills .
it &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about the long-term , it &apos;s about the long-term .
i want to explain a little bit about that .
there are technical concepts like the augmented reality , which means that the extended reality is .
so if you look at google , for example , then one concept , which is what the virtual world is doing with the real world , which means our rosy world is going to be a little normal , natural than something normal is going to be understood .
another example is that so-called virtual reality .
so , of course , that &apos;s what i like to hear in the context of my talk , because we &apos;re moving in the standard of physical ecosystems , virtual worlds , very after the model of the brain .
and other examples are the most powerful , intelligent systems .
these are rooms that can respond to a human being .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i &apos;ve been in advance and i hope that the video works , a very , very beautiful project , that &apos;s the most powerful of michael &apos;s favorite , a researcher , and the most powerful , recyclable , recyclable , and plastic of the plastic .
and the two main ones are also here today .
maybe you &apos;re going to stand up to the side of your breath , so you can talk to the two of the project .
and this project i brought up as an example of the way that i have been involved in this particular picture , is driven to cognitive models .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say .
what the most powerful of course and it &apos;s a computer game is a computer game .
and if i say video games , they &apos;re very likely to have a lot of eyes that people are people who are in front of a human race or that they &apos;re playing with the one of the other people who are playing with any kind of a plastic .
anyway , they &apos;re doing that in the same way .
this is a game for outside .
and that &apos;s specifically what i thought i was looking at the outside world , so i discover the real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data that we produce , the real world we produce .
i apologize that i have to fool so much .
you can explain that much better , and there &apos;s more to it , there &apos;s more .
and it &apos;s about that i discover a city by looking at what was positive or negative , which was positive .
and so i get a whole view of the city , a very different impression , which is , i see negative and positive zones of a city and get a whole different , virtual map of a very real city .
and we can now look at this .
ah , what you can see here , sorry , is a little explanation of what you see .
of course , this virtual world is in the walls of our cities , is yes .
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize that , my talk and the senses that the qualities and the skills that we &apos;ve acquired from the most violent , and we &apos;ve gone to the machine , that we have a little bit of a bit of a technology , and that we &apos;re going to come back to our roots , and that we &apos;re going to come back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very , very good at you .
i &apos;ve been asked to be asked if this bag is a bag bag and i &apos;m going to talk to you .
it &apos;s not going to do that .
i &apos;m also going to resolve what &apos;s inside .
but i just do it in the n , just a little bit more curious .
yes , kids are curious from nature or should be curious , designers .
i &apos;m a designer of the house , so i &apos;m also going to be with the subject of curiosity and how curiosity is changing , and why we might be curiosity and we have to be curiosity and so on .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re dealing with next to the actual existence of a creator .
if professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to be in so much like this in &apos; n .
and that &apos;s what i had half the year .
a key to natural user interface design design .
now you &apos;re going to ask yourself why the whole designers are going to start with this natural , more powerful , and so on , to engage with the interaction of communication and so on .
and i just think of one of these little devices , because things are always going to be more intuitive , and the more natural , more natural , and you have to look at what &apos;s actually about us , of course , what is the human &apos;s or intuitive .
and before the background , i have been in natural user interface , so the next generation in the human computer is busy engaged in the relationship of human computers , as our tools , or how the computer is going to change from the computer to the digital assistant .
so i was busy , when , of course , what or intuitive .
maybe again , you have to look at it .
why does that happen ?
so if we look at the evolution of our society , here &apos;s a moment , we &apos;re going to move from the third to the fourth , or the fourth of the world .
so from modern in the world .
every society is shaped by a long-term design .
the first thing that the language is at the beginning .
that means you &apos;ve found a common language , you could communicate with each other , and then put it into the same cave , or in other areas , has created cities or villages and have it , sort of , create the name of the way .
but the most powerful thing was , the language , something very natural , something very much .
it also had to learn , so no toaster can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it , and we &apos;re learning it , of course .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been giving to the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
this was a little bit of a school , because of course , because of course , the living language started to experiment in the form of script , which is what &apos;s called the most powerful and alive , i start to do it and i put it in stone and i do it .
depending on how i &apos;m going to go and see when i &apos;m going to get a lot of time , of course , it &apos;s a different story when there &apos;s a living in a lifetime .
but then , they moved this script as a computer designer , got off .
then the next generation , in which we actually live in the lives of life .
this is just the printing record of the printing record with wolfgang and the other .
and then it was just a very , very basic , where the textiles , the other , and other people said , are you actually really crazy if the people start reading , then they want to be still shouting and , of course , completely free .
and now we &apos;re going to come into the next generation and the exciting , so a very , very exciting one , and we &apos;re really in this in this particular phase , that we &apos;re going to be involved in this in this sort of space phase .
of course , the confused us , of course , because we see the new media , the social media , the social media , facebook , and so on .
with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what &apos;s the old thinking revealed on the old thinking , don &apos;t say that in the most violent and no matter , i &apos;m just trying to do that , and i want to do that .
and these two worlds just pop up , new and old thinking .
so , the exciting thing is , if you look at this , this new society , these kind of new societies , the most powerful , and the key paradigm from the most violent , principles and the cooling paradigm from the brain .
but now , not more on local level , but in global level .
we &apos;ve understood that the weather is global .
that the subject is a global ecology .
not if i think local and the neighbor thinks less ecologically , then it doesn &apos;t work all the time .
that means that the local village is actually a global village with the same principles , of course , of course , in the same way , but also the total transparency .
as you knew at the time in the village , who had what was going on with whom and when , this is what happens today about this extension of our self through these mobile phones .
it &apos;s that we know global celebrations and more and more and more and more .
so it was just like it was on the village .
so before the background , i &apos;ve been busy looking at what &apos;s it called , because what &apos;s actually , of course , what is we also , what is the difference for us , but what &apos;s the difference ?
because often people come to it , they can &apos;t do it , so that everyone can deal with it .
so you have to deal with what &apos;s called , and not just change it , but it &apos;s going to be better , but it &apos;s going to be better .
and when , of course , is something intuitive and how i can take a designer on it , and just as a creator , and so that they &apos;re making a sense of the same thing that they &apos;re a little bit intuitive , so they &apos;re just going to be doing fun and simply using it .
you &apos;re busy , as well as studying the research , with the subject of perception and the most powerful .
and that &apos;s , of course , what you &apos;re going to do , and look and look and look and say , okay , now i &apos;m going to look at the inside of the inner self .
and what &apos;s it like in there ?
so how do we work when we get there ?
and what does it mean , of course , intuitive and how do our channels work in perception and how the cognitive processing works ?
because steve jobs said you &apos;re going to be able to dig up to dig up to dig up to dig up the road .
so you really have to look at the details , if i want to make something more intuitive or intuitive , what does that mean in the core .
and you see that you have a our seven senses , most of us have only five , now , now , in the near future , there &apos;s still seven , there &apos;s still the next , eighth sense , and as an extension of the self , again , our self .
and to look at how we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that is a difference .
many use the word , but not what it does , but then it &apos;s very good .
but i have to understand in the core , understanding the nature , when information is information , when information is information and from information , so i know how to do things later , and of course , i can do things like i can do , or not , of course .
and of course , as design impacts influence , it &apos;s also the perception .
we see this , if i make things , then i can design it , like , the right thing , where i don &apos;t know what is salt and pepper , or i can make it intuitive by showing things .
so a lot of natural , which is in a single branch , but i &apos;m kind of looking at the kind of salt where salt and pepper is inside .
and if i tell someone , i &apos;m giving salt or pepper , then he &apos;s going to think about the right thing where it &apos;s in .
and just in the left , just intuitive access and then hopefully , that no sugar is in it , just giving the salt down .
but also our perception itself , how does it make us .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the little , although it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just equally closely , and yet our perception is the way we make things happen .
anybody know what that is ?
hmmm on .
and the most powerful thing is , should work .
there &apos;s a more , it &apos;s going to be a little bit more .
so it &apos;s n .
a second circle already starts to crack certain resemblance or associate .
and then if i &apos;m going to stop a more , a little bit more , we &apos;re not just looking at a unit , which is a circle , circle , circle and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle .
and this is what &apos;s called the most powerful or just the way that we can also influence that in perception .
for the creator , the most important , they have the most amazing semester , the great ted company .
so , the middle of the tree , the continuity of the continuity and so on .
so , in the third , again , you forget .
but this is an essential important component , if you want to make things very intuitive at that same way .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , is the view .
so , it sounds very banal , but it &apos;s very exciting to be very excited about it .
so we have the eyes on the front , and now you think we &apos;re looking at the back .
that &apos;s wrong .
you can see from back to the back .
because they &apos;re a cool thing to go forward , that they see something that they recognize , which is what they recognize , the way they recognize .
that means we &apos;re only seeing our vision before we see it , and then we see it back to the back of our online field to say , okay , okay , okay .
i have such cognitive cognitive contact , you &apos;ve got what you want to see .
and that &apos;s then there , that &apos;s coming back .
then it goes back to the front , because the back is not the front , and says , now look at it , but you &apos;re going to look at it , and you can see what you see , also what you want to see .
and then it goes back to back and then it &apos;s actually just seen .
so a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very repetitive process .
i don &apos;t know who you know of this picture .
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;ve described to you .
now , everyone &apos;s trying to see something about this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who recognizes what .
does anybody see something a little bit ?
a very , right .
if i saw that , that &apos;s where there &apos;s a computer company in there , you know .
they &apos;ll never forget it because i &apos;ll show you where the most violent is .
now you see the most powerful .
and on , you &apos;re still seeing it .
so , i mean , i &apos;ve actually got them to get out of the way that they don &apos;t recognize patterns anymore , but i have them in a very short time , and i &apos;ve got to see this dog in a very short time .
and this is the projection of seeing , and you see , you see , you see .
now i know , and now i &apos;m going to go back to the front of the time that i see the most powerful .
i see the most powerful .
so , very exciting processes that then , in this , yes , gray is actually not , but here in this particular crowd , it &apos;s just going to work on this .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know something three seconds , i &apos;m going to get out of the present in the front of the world , and then i can also bridge very well to bridge , and i &apos;m going to have a lot of time to do it with three seconds .
it &apos;s just to process it as a present .
then it goes into the past and i can bridge very elegant , for example , at the computer , when i know this phenomenon .
what does the sound show take milliseconds ?
yeah , milliseconds .
a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time that you fall in love with .
that means that a warning , if you know that , you &apos;re looking at who you look like , because i don &apos;t check a gun for what can happen according to it .
and the 16 milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time of most perceptions that we have .
that means that the first impression is happening in a rapid speed , how we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at and how we &apos;re doing it , we can think about our environment so that we can think about it .
of course , the designers don &apos;t just relate to the subject and neural networking or neural , but primarily , of course , with the topic of the internet .
so , like a human being , it &apos;s about some things .
there &apos;s a time that the practical functions , so the things that are so versatile or more of things .
there &apos;s a lot of time where i know exactly where to get it .
but there are also symbolic functions , why is there any kind of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , where hardly what &apos;s going on , so much of the stuff that &apos;s not going to be like that ?
we &apos;re more in error of error , on the surface of the world , which we also have to engage with as a creator .
back to my actual topic of natural user interface and the theme of what &apos;s natural , of course , is the case of the brain .
so , the idea is , as i can get a certain goal , or how can a certain goal can be able to do a certain amount of a certain , efficient and unhappy goal to achieve a goal .
so it &apos;s like this , it &apos;s more like that .
how do i make something like this ?
i can use that directly or i need to go and do it , or i need to have a lot of training for it .
and less of the water or a nuclear or a half is it .
that i just make this , and make beautiful , is not that it &apos;s better than it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that .
and if you &apos;re in part of the software that we &apos;ve seen , you &apos;ll also understand why 99 percent of our software is very intuitive or not useful , and it &apos;s actually embedded in many areas , or in a lot of ways , even though it &apos;s more intuitive than classical software .
and in fact , intuitive design is not just for apple , and the main thing that is a fundamental thing , is , if i just want to use technological equipment , the main thing that i want to do is make a difference for people .
why ?
because in the rule of the new species of the world , the natural user , for example , are the same , for example , the average user , for five times a long time .
you have to imagine that if you do something of the classical , five hours , and you need to take a little bit of the new kind of software , and only one hour of natural software is only an hour .
it doesn &apos;t mean that you can probably go home four hours more after home , but your employer or you can &apos;t get a , like it &apos;s working with the four hours .
but i want to say that it &apos;s a very clear thing for us to do , of course , to make a difference .
so if we &apos;re going to go back to the software , this is the first of the most primitive line aircraft interface , which were very abstract , where you needed months to deal with these systems .
then the next one that we &apos;ve been doing with a studio now , or mental model , is how software tells you that you &apos;ve been working , which is you have a picture of something that &apos;s the metaphor of a desktop to make the computer useful .
so not more zeros , and ones or the ones , or the ones , but just a metaphor .
that &apos;s what it did , but it &apos;s a lot more of the way that it &apos;s been .
the next generation of gamers is a lot more with behavior .
so , i &apos;m designing a lot more often as a creator than this .
this is also a paradigm paradigm .
that i &apos;m looking at that , that &apos;s the success of success , just the most successful thing that is going to be an app .
and then if i &apos;m going to go to this natural user interface in these natural users where i &apos;m at a voice , with language , by touch , by the gesture , by gesture and gps , and the things that have to control , i &apos;m more quickly and more quickly .
but that leads me to the point , but when will the things be more intuitive ?
if you &apos;re more intuitive , and then i have to take my little friend , and look at what does it mean because of the point of view , when is it really something that &apos;s really intuitive ?
and that &apos;s for us people always , if i have to think about it , and i have to think about it .
so , he doesn &apos;t like to think , but it &apos;s all that they &apos;re doing .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for designers ?
so , that means that we can transmit existing input of a place on something else , for example , the metaphor , then i can do that as a designer .
that means i can actually transmit an intuitive human , human security system on a software and make the software much more powerful .
now , of course , the question is , what is the most important thing about the most powerful of us and now i &apos;ve already said it .
this is called the so-called steel project .
and that uses each of us and the most dynamic is an acronym and stands for excuses , and it &apos;s an acronym , the master , the master , the master .
this is what everybody does , but it &apos;s doing it &apos;s intimate and it &apos;s kind of intuitive and , yes , even instinctively .
the model is already going to be in the womb and is a lot of time , so it works globally at young and old , and it &apos;s going to be used by us all the time without most that most of the time that this model is there .
and the most violent thing about 50 to the time of the day is about 50 to the time of the day , so in sleep , you &apos;ve found that it &apos;s less often more often more often than the day .
i can now orient this mental diagnostic , and i can do this mental design , a master &apos;s , to a computer company .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the internet , but not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a design of a design , a more a game of a computer .
and this is on a higher grail of the world &apos;s population as the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the most of the time .
and if i &apos;m going to do this now , for example , in the face of the face of a mirror , a choice of the way that i &apos;m going to be able to look at it , i can look at it in the details , and i can see , i can go somewhere , and i can go back and buy it , and so on , and so on , i can throw it up .
then i can transmit the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to give you a bet .
and it &apos;s just a cake that &apos;s got a se .
and the common thing is , i &apos;m kind of interacting with the object , and i can zoom back again .
i &apos;ll get the whole whole whole whole view of this filter , and can say , show me all the thing with chocolate .
and once a piece of interface , what &apos;s much more intuitive and much more intuitive .
because , because i can reach the things like the bits , and they can come to me , and they &apos;re going to come to me , is much natural than if we can do the term , or the other mechanisms of the stuff that can make these things available .
imagination is more more powerful , and with this sentence , i like to close a and to give the evidence , also designers , also need to think differently to get to new solutions , and thank you very much for having to be a very welcome and please .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first thing you &apos;re going to be as a child is as a baby , is that you &apos;re taking care of what you have , right ? and depending on if your parents have allowed you to play more or less in the middle of your parents , and then move more or more in the middle of the day , the more , you know , your curiosity .
and curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
so , all of that is , you know , who are here and curious , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m now about this , basically , all this whole whole whole unit , the u.s. growth , 40 years of power , in quality of the ground .
and there &apos;s a central point of this .
and it depends on phosphorus .
give a chance to give you a chance .
every day you give a + scale about two grams of phosphorus , and every day you have to take two grams of phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only glide as a haiku , and we could just slide through the u.s.
if we do not take phosphorus , and we get to get it .
amazingly , it &apos;s so , we &apos;re here to do something about something , which is actually a lot of value , but not that .
because all of the energy , but nobody talks about the most powerful .
the most critical thing is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have phosphorus and we &apos;re going to have a lot more of the phosphorus , and we &apos;ve got a lot more uranium in the world than all the nuclear energy used in all the nuclear cities .
in the last 20 years , the most violent tons of uranium are distributed on our fields in germany .
and we take it all up .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , the environment , drive less cars .
the environment , make less waste .
the environment , the environment , is less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
this is how i would say , you know , your child , pop it only three times instead of five times .
this is just a little bit less destruction .
if we think about the birthplace of the womb , our whole earth will be used or later , and later a cemetery .
so , that &apos;s why the womb to think about .
and the most important thing about looking at the ground , as first .
in the ground , over 60 percent of the world &apos;s oil .
now , in the moment , corn and losing corn is going to be reduced to the $ 11 thousand tons per hectare or on the square feet .
that means we &apos;re losing more than five times more than four times more than new ones .
we can actually look at the most powerful thing .
and everything is packaging , or content .
for example , in the most violent , 20 percent of the world &apos;s favorite reserve is the most populous .
and because we &apos;re getting older , the bison are going to be bigger .
this is what they &apos;re all in the world &apos;s business .
yes ?
one baby needs about six pounds of the baby .
we could of course reduce this about 10 percent , but what does that do ?
this is a balanced in china in a second .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we do with this bison ?
here &apos;s one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is being emitted in the pigs about the solid components .
people about the urine .
yes .
so , you can &apos;t be a pigs .
because that &apos;s what &apos;s shown with it , right ?
traditionally , we think in the world &apos;s office , we &apos;re too many on the world .
and if you have the people who are going to be able to live the people who are , if you say , that would be better , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be hostile and instinctively .
and so someone says , &quot; al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more accurate than the human population to stabilize .
in israel , you say , if you &apos;re a human being , you &apos;re going to be a world .
here it says , the more you &apos;re going to be more restrained . the better .
yes .
the first question is , are we really too much ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants weigh about four times more than we humans .
i could take termites , but in the united states , no one likes termites , in so far , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means that the ants weigh much more than we .
and because they work harder , they &apos;re more difficult than we and because they live only three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in the energy consumption , something 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too much , we &apos;re too stupid , right ?
and where you see how far we &apos;re going to get away , and could we really do , and how sad we are , we can see that we &apos;re at all on earth , you can see that for example , a program has to be a program , to have a program , right ?
you can only be a little bit more accurate when you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
did you see a tree tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want to be fried than trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is a tree .
luckily , don &apos;t you ?
there &apos;s no one of the trees on trees .
there are still six billion trees alone in the seawater .
you &apos;ve heard about it already from trees , right ?
that means all of our intelligence means that we want to be fried than trees .
and where you see , even in a little bit like crutches , the most violent biological , and the most prolific biological , which doesn &apos;t allow us to go back our own business .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go back into the layers .
and so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s alone .
we feel so guilty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no one , no more , no more , no more , no more , no , no , and how they all are saying that our own vibrio .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , which is the oil industry .
but where are we useful ?
we try to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it comes to the environment , it &apos;s the highest , not to be there , right ?
so , yeah , right ?
you can only have a little bit of time when you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot yourself now , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can pull our nutrients back .
we &apos;re doing in brazil in brazil , where we go back to nutrients .
right now , we can put nutrients in the way that we can do that in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china for example , where we take the waste of that .
in china , a more powerful thing is called a more powerful , and , yes , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid to put our nutrients .
that means that the western western field is going to be the fact that the city has always taken , but the farmers never put something to .
and so , the cities had to grow more and more , because the farmers in the cities were going to go and have the cities to get their nutrients .
so all of the western people are always expanding , until they have no longer done the infrastructure , and then they &apos;re a pickle reserve .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve done a new civilization over five thousand years , because you &apos;ve always been able to do nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat in china , you would expect to stay as long as you &apos;re going to keep the toilet .
because it &apos;s an animated , and the nutrients are going to take .
you &apos;ve got them to eat them , not to the food system .
that means you can see the net in the internet , as you can pull off nutrients .
so , actually , the beautiful thing is , if you do that , agriculture creates , it creates a hectare of land , and it &apos;s a mile of a mile in favelas , and it can run a farmer about a small dollar and the plant and the whole , and the shark and the fish and the fish .
and the great thing about this is that the most powerful in the favelas is about 90 percent .
so we don &apos;t need to control people , too much bad .
we can support them , good .
this is natural , of course , but the facilities are carrying themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by design , which is a farmer that can just manage them .
that means that the most important thing is going to go back .
and no one of these facilities , we &apos;ve built over the last 20 years now in the last 20 years , not that they &apos;ve ever been used by these facilities .
you could just be able to get a liter of a liter of a liter of water and then the plant would be ruined over years .
don &apos;t find any of it .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people , too bad .
we can support them , good .
that means we need to use phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you &apos;re going to be able to be in germany , in germany , the best of all the drug cycles in the world .
unfortunately , not in the street of the world , but maybe you can help the world &apos;s work .
because the most important facility could be best the phosphorus back .
and that has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s really possible .
we &apos;ve been using it in holland now over three years .
the dutch government explains it , you will be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need that all the time .
you know , there are two countries , which control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
there &apos;s opec a bunch of plastic types .
these are the countries that are controlling 40 percent of the oil &apos;s population .
and the oil is going to replace us by other energy fuels .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace it .
it &apos;s not about making the existing one less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s especially asking questions about what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , of course , you understand that , of course , the land is made in the south of the country , and it &apos;s built in the south of the country .
yes ?
imagine if your wife is sad , if you &apos;ve been upset , and you come to 50 horsepower .
very inefficient .
but really , really , right ?
or take a clue .
a woman in germany eats about six kilograms of three kilograms of life during their lifetime .
it &apos;s .
it &apos;s not just scientific , because because we don &apos;t know how much more sophisticated it is .
but a clue , even in this lighting , can i tell you , is completely inefficient , but really , really , right ?
it &apos;s all that it &apos;s beautiful in life , it &apos;s not efficient .
it &apos;s not resource efficiency , but efficiency .
to ask , what is the right ?
not to burn the internet , and it &apos;s a little better to burn and put it in the field of the whole materials for the whole materials , but first to ask , how do you get the yield cycles ?
imagine mozart efficient .
yes ?
if i put them on dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with a little bit of a glass and a glass of water .
wonderful , &quot; ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
that means that everything in life counts , not to avoid saving , to avoid reducing .
all the research .
we say the people , oh , you don &apos;t have any green in the south .
no , it &apos;s just the right thing that &apos;s going to throw out right now .
in every place where you &apos;re going to be , you know , you can get back , you can get back .
but the wrong things .
if you put the wrong things together , you have a more powerful thing .
in how we think of north africa .
there &apos;s any footprint there .
if you walk , yes , everybody destroys the ground .
because the soil is going to die , the mosses are dying and the wind and the water is driving the soil .
but if you &apos;re in italy , everyone means any footprint that the water is longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that will be a bureaucracy .
not the usual .
we &apos;re in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask you how to do it with her wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , &quot; well , i &apos;m sorry , &quot; do you ?
this is the minimum .
so not saving , not to prevent , avoid .
every waste is overall .
and it &apos;s a lust when you see in italy , like people in high bow , like the people in the high bow of coke .
because you know , this is a kind of a transformative process .
it &apos;s a different form of engineering , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a computer company that &apos;s in room room in room room .
you can throw it out where you go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re going around .
and it contains seeds from rare plants so that they &apos;re going through the biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so it &apos;s two layers of light .
not all of it should be antennae .
a television machine or a washing machine that you &apos;re using is not just using it .
just the things that are the most violent , like the computer , like the way that the computer companies , like the way that they have to go , they have to go into biological systems .
things that are used only to go to technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the most powerful , yes ?
so , direct advertising , not for the company , not for a se by se , but that they &apos;re helping that company to make these products successful .
because we don &apos;t do things more free .
yes ?
so , if i &apos;m going to go to dinner and say that &apos;s free of the street , it helps you do nothing .
no , we &apos;re stuck in what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like the internet game .
not toxic .
it &apos;s all that &apos;s in it .
these are the first shoes that you can take the back of the air on the surface of the mountain and go rubber into biological pulses , right ?
everything is the palm of it .
and if we can do it , of course , we can do it for a heroin , for nike , for the whole industry and the whole textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of all the world &apos;s population , which is caused by the textile industry .
so , you help me ask , you know , to people , you know , for people .
hey , ep , do you really do serious ?
because they &apos;ve been able to have a double time .
and i &apos;m not sure you really have a really clear thing .
so , let me just help you .
but it &apos;s .
yes .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been shown .
this is .
we can now do things so that if you break , if you break , you can break into biological implants .
technical yield is just as much .
there &apos;s a direct diagnostic system .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , that &apos;s made to go back to the cycle .
so , in every store , you can make things more like the things .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the aston ?
when it &apos;s right now , it &apos;s the waste .
all over the place , this cosmology is almost .
in the countries where people are getting to money .
there &apos;s on the front of the street , but also in the landscape , yes ?
if we change the plastic , so that it can go into biological systems if we change the most powerful , the inside that they can just go back to the surface of the road , and then they can use a baby in israel or in tunisia .
yes ?
if you take these , you can take these pacemakers , throw them out , tick and push the powder to plant trees .
so the baby is the baby &apos;s baby for all of the life , from beginning .
so we don &apos;t need to be more enjoyable , we can be more nuanced .
it &apos;s kind of a plastic ring , and it &apos;s a kind of a wire signal .
yeah , so .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can reinvent everything else .
i started a institute .
now , there are many people working with and they can all engage .
there &apos;s extra a club to do , and you can get a group of people in that .
so not more , not saving , prevent , not , not a drug , but smart waste .
does it make you curious ?
thank you .
the work of the brain .
music as a language .
in the description of my talk , i wrote that i was as a computer designer , as a computer designer , so in english , i understand .
the language of the written notes are a popular notes in the hidden music .
that you &apos;re not just sending word a word for word to the text in another language , but also the deeper sense of words and the deeper sense of words , and it has to understand it , so that it &apos;s going to make a meaningful translation .
in the english to the english to the english , more knowledge can require more knowledge , and it can be , if you &apos;re about poetry or even about poetry .
but it &apos;s very alien to contradiction , which we do with our own business system .
when i first got a paper of a football book , i just got the written notes .
you think that the composer in the notes has all the time that he has dreamed of what he was going to do .
in fact , the notes are very vague and stunned .
these notes are about just the same or not , like a verbal verbal , and also , as a verbal , very seemingly accurate description , explains a landscape .
because in this verbal verbal piece , the smell of the flowers don &apos;t smell the way to be able to make the degree of the fuel system , not to feel the most powerful of the water &apos;s brain .
that means the vendor needs to be very reliable about the millennium policy in a different , which is a different , concrete , non-verbal , non-verbal , non-verbal .
today i want to tell you what i &apos;m doing , and i &apos;m going to translate to you , so i &apos;m going to translate to a verbal language , so that &apos;s a verbal language .
so , basically a translation of translation .
so i &apos;m going to put it in front of the whole german thing , because if i had to translate it to english , it would be the translation of translation of translation of translation .
so the music works for me as much as the spoken language .
the main notes have the function of the letters of a script .
so it won &apos;t be just a fan of learning , and it &apos;s going to be the real notes on the piano or the right place to press on a piano level .
because that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the reason that the letters is , you can only see the language .
and so , for the learning process , you need to have at least long as the spoken language of music .
there &apos;s also a sweat , if you learn it for the most profitable , just passive or you can talk to you , until the musical speaker .
the work of the internet is similar to how one &apos;s a computer of a computer .
after first , a piece of play has chosen to play because you &apos;re excited about the origin of the composition of the composition .
you accumulate information on the piece of the brain .
you read in the letters , you &apos;re reading notes , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts of himself .
you studied the works that he wrote before and after .
you &apos;re comparing .
the motives , it &apos;s to write .
how and what does he feel ?
how were his circumstances , how the society and politics ?
all of this is interested in me .
you think in this time , in the time you look at the same , you know , you &apos;re looking at the same as contemporary images or you &apos;re reading literature .
but as a result , you also have a single known knowledge , but as a result , a rich knowledge of the composers you play , and it always falls easier to feel in it and feel it .
the composer is always going to be more to the friend that you live together .
his cause to write the piece of writing is always more and more to my personal concerns , to play .
now , the notes all the other people are doing a very precise record of the event , but just a framework , i &apos;m going to turn this scaffold to it , and i &apos;m going to turn it to the point of meaning and meaning .
i &apos;m going to say to my own words , which could be written between this framework .
i play the same thing that might have these sound for what these sound might have .
now for me , and for the composers , and what they now mean for him today .
every note , every phrase gets a sense of having a sense of self because it comes from my own now , because it comes from my own now .
it has to be in this and now , i &apos;m going to be now , and now i can &apos;t convince my audience to do that , that my cause is .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , and i can have the experience that i have been able to do so long in advance , how to experience new .
and as you &apos;ve seen a happy new day , even though it &apos;s all the same rituals of life , up , breakfast , to work , the work , i think , is the same piece of time that i always have to go back to the new .
i &apos;ve become older , a day , growing seasons , and my pulse is slow down at night when the morning takes longer , it takes longer to return to the sound .
i take the audience &apos;s breath , consciously , or unconscious .
all of this affects me and all this is influenced by the composition of the composition .
so , it &apos;s also wonderful , when i stand with a video of a chair on stage and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , more satisfying conversation .
you get a new idea in the same , and you &apos;ll get this answers with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting because things are going to happen , and that &apos;s not what we can &apos;t have experienced and what you can &apos;t do .
it makes great fun to make music , and you have the audience , and then you &apos;ve experienced the way the music communicates alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;m never going to play so much , like this moment .
i can &apos;t play that way in 20 years .
i &apos;m going to have more life expectancy than today and therefore , and so on , i &apos;m going to have a lot more of the life of the world &apos;s life , and so far more , emotion and emotion as today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some of the things that i &apos;m going to do , but for new entrepreneurial management .
have a nice physical example of this .
it was on a street conference for the most successful old teacher , professor , professor , professor , a well-known white , a famous white , a young professor of the civil war , and a long professor of the civil war .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so he was a lot of time to go to school when i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortune , very early , to meet , and i was to meet my school at the heart of school .
i was 17 , when i took back to one of his courses , and i played the last of the four bond of chopin , a computer company .
he asked me what the introduction of this kind of thing was for me .
this is a very , very part of a part .
and i said , in my favorite business , i said expectation .
he &apos;s going to be and said , &quot; so ? &quot;
that must be the most powerful .
because for me , she means memory .
he was about 60 .
well , with 17 , you have dreams , but not a big memory .
i play the piece of all the years , and i &apos;ve got it all over the course , and it has changed for me , although not a single note has changed .
every time it &apos;s exciting , i &apos;m going to be talking about something new .
one example of a very different area . prints made the most powerful of the brain .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but in a lot of time , at the time of the day , at the time of the light .
he &apos;s translated the most sophisticated , translated to the way he saw it , like it &apos;s at the moment .
his personal health system of the world &apos;s life .
the most elegant interpretation of a piece is comparable .
now , i &apos;ve also been older than chopin , as he wrote the piece of the piece .
he &apos;s lived only for a year .
and it &apos;s important to look at the notes , and even though i mean , you can see it .
to keep the squid , right with the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially when he died .
now , how do you start talking about music ?
i said yes , you need about the spoken language of language .
often the most powerful thing is that you &apos;re only learning the notes .
you learn virtually first reading before you just talk a word .
you learn to find the notes on the notes on the instrument .
if all the fingers in time and right , like it &apos;s in the notes , they &apos;re moving out , they come out of sound that sounds like music .
if that &apos;s accurate , the student gets the most powerful piece .
so , over interpretation , hardly speaking in the field .
well , there &apos;s a very fast thing on the front , which is a quick piece .
so , slow , slow .
and it &apos;s noisy , and b , etc .
that &apos;s what most of you know .
but even if you put that data on , it still stays something technical .
and it &apos;s still not a interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that often you &apos;re often forgotten to forget .
because , to make music on the instrument , the musical to do their musical business , and they have to feel there .
that &apos;s what singing .
a child who didn &apos;t learn that , because it doesn &apos;t have the parents , it &apos;s not going to do it even .
this is like the most cosmopolitan .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and the idea of music to make it more and more , so a tool , to make it sound .
people who never sang , have never felt more directly with their body , like it &apos;s , to form a sound .
a phrase with his own breath .
because the music card is the extension of our body .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the main line of the piano is the sequel of my finger .
the tune emerges from the dance and the rhythm from the dance .
the cheapest video system today is not being addressed .
you don &apos;t need to make music even more than it becomes boring .
not need to go to a whistle , or singing a whistle .
every single music is being violated when you &apos;re going to be able to get away from the outside with music .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t sing ?
the question i can &apos;t sing , can you not sing , a , because you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they don &apos;t learn to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to start to find out whether they can &apos;t , or learning how to do these little muscles , which are the vocal chords , right .
because you can train .
or c , because you &apos;re going to have them , they &apos;re a little bit more friendly .
i wonder how much of the was disruptive , this diagnosis ?
did you get a more powerful or a computer designer , like you &apos;re now saying it now ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and you don &apos;t want to do that for any failure .
but what i would do is , you know , music is a beautiful , a little bit of a sudden , a little bit of a sudden .
but maybe you can even get more sophisticated .
well , you know , you have to see all of the cases , nobody has to be a more powerful candidate .
but please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand anything from classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
i know , but surely you can say , you know , it &apos;s like you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it says , somebody , i don &apos;t know if i don &apos;t feel it , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t get to eat , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to get rid of classical music , because they don &apos;t play a instrument .
listen consciously , and say , if it tastes you or not .
whether the music is to be to be too sweet or too sweet .
tell that what you &apos;re feeling .
and then , with time , they &apos;re also going to get to the same , and they want to be a little bit more spices there , or taste some of the things that are .
now , why do i challenge my audience now that it &apos;s also actively active ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate .
a piece of artwork that you never look at , has no force to work .
the food that was a chef or a chef was a cook , and not just looked at the recipes or a separate of recipes .
so please listen to , if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice thing .
if in a environment where the adults are doing music , or are the most active music , the child is going to be a child , and then it &apos;s very easy to ask a child , and then it &apos;s easy to ask , what color has your flower ?
can you do it in blue now ?
and the kid plays , after a giant , rather than a red flower now , a blue flower .
and this sounds very different than before .
and that was the first beginning of a personal piece of expression .
so the first step to a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that had been written a hundred , two thousand years ago , or three thousand years ago , in front of a hundred years ago ?
now , the tools have moved .
there was a way of bach that &apos;s not even a piano .
it was not just invented .
i think the stream would have been thrilled if it had had the distinction of the modern possibilities of modern health .
i can now have the most powerful , which is the stream of the stream , to sound a little bit of a sudden , which is a kind of a carbon cap .
and by beethoven , you know that he heard more than he had been deaf .
today , modern orchestra is able to play everything that has a orchestra from the back of the day as a result .
so the composers are dependent on us , which are going to reinvent the pieces .
so they &apos;re going to be peeling , what they just dreamed of in the spirit .
and also , what you would think of today .
or what i &apos;m going to do today is , because what they thought was .
thank you .
you know what &apos;s envy ?
were they jealous of them ?
and how did that feel like ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a car service .
when i come to my little v , i &apos;m going to go up with my little v , and i get to the mind .
i &apos;m going to take something through the head .
i say , &quot; well , what do you need to do big car ? &quot;
that &apos;s what you &apos;re losing in the first year half of its value .
and at all , you work much less than i am .
why do i have to do that as n ?
and then i &apos;m going to keep a little bit more friendly .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say , &quot; justice , &quot; this awkward feeling is gone .
our organism has invented a great way to just get such an f feelings like envy .
you can also try to do that with words like revenge or a cloud or a census .
i want to explain to you this mechanism today , or something that is just about to be familiar with what you &apos;re doing .
the mechanism is from the lie .
but think of it not as you may have heard , if people say , nobody has the intention to build a wall .
and then rocks put them down so that he &apos;s cutting them down .
and you see , in a lie , you see that the liars don &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to check out that it has a whole different sense of mind .
it &apos;s just a problem that it &apos;s just not going to be and not yourself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about is to make it deceive to be deceived .
they need this lie to get a more friendly , to get an self-deception walk .
you can get less easily , yes , the more stable or even the radiation .
they need time .
and this time , a anecdote tells you that maybe you know .
the spanish painter , once , was a woman , a woman .
and this woman was complaining about , he was not going to see the portrait of her .
picasso is just waiting for you .
it &apos;s always going to be more similar .
and in this place , and when you laugh , you realize how important this lie is and how much time you need to experience something , what artists can tell us about .
because artists have a graduate relationship to the lie .
the artist tells you something , and especially this lady , what you don &apos;t see when you just look at the mirror .
the artist tells you something like this in a portrait , which you &apos;re just going to be familiar with when you look at this piece of artwork .
then this awkward feeling disappears , it could not be like you can see , and it &apos;s going to be more similar to you .
here you have this mechanism that we can use the lie as a great invention to the most of our main systems .
and not only in art , in the same time in the mythology , in the mythology , in stories , it &apos;s coming back .
you may know this idea of the lady , which looked at every morning in the mirror and asked him who is the most beautiful in the entire country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a computer game .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this true deal , also the mirror cannot lie , from this true overcome .
but we should just be familiar with that , that you can &apos;t tell a woman , that there is a more different one somewhere .
here it takes , which we understand under the surface of the road , and then put together .
we need this position that the deception of the delusion is to keep us without the rest of us .
we don &apos;t just have in art , in the world &apos;s office , but in science such as great lies .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s wife &apos;s history .
she heard about this book from charles darwin , the emergence of the species and the u.s. ancestry of people .
that the man of the monkey , and , yes , there would be a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then they ran them to her husband , and he said , &quot; well , that &apos;s not true , &quot; which charles writes .
the human being is to adapt to the monkeys or a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , then we need to prevent people from that .
why do we need to prevent people from something if it &apos;s true ?
because we cannot live without these things .
because we &apos;re doing this self-deception , this feeling , great to be , to be a foreign , from the highest nature , not from such a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of organism that exists in a way that is more like a gene , and otherwise , which is for us .
so , we can &apos;t admit these things .
we need to prevent people from things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you see , as slowly as this mechanism , it turns out , and how the traces that he leaves , which is going to be going on on something else than on this great picture of ourselves , i want to update you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , like i am .
my wife told me she .
she came from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told her about a student .
a student student .
she likes to really love it because he has a slope to spider dancers .
and she asked him what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire floor .
and because i &apos;m at the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in the same thing for the ted department .
yes , you feel it if you &apos;re hit at this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i said , i &apos;ve always said , if a human being in a moral position , the most powerful thing is , because using the , we should try to replace it through the most violent .
and then you &apos;re going to learn that and then you learn the sentence .
although i &apos;m at the fire floor , i &apos;m interested in the things that i &apos;m interested in .
they feel that this is the real truth behind the handle .
so a little bit of a plastic , which is not interested in the search of the day .
the interest is interested in the world .
but there are no clubs that we can do , where we can learn how to do fire .
there &apos;s only the second second , the fire center .
it &apos;s signed up .
and you can &apos;t tell your teacher , you don &apos;t like to put your teacher somewhere somewhere , and you &apos;re happy when the fire came out after that .
no , it just looks better , if we show that we &apos;re involved in the dangers of eliminating the other , the other people , if they put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this one of these predatory things that had known to be seen in the pool of the body that he actually knew about the fire , but that he can &apos;t say that loud .
here you have this kind of time-lapse between the unconscious and the conscious , which immediately jumps down , without that you can do something about it , and the things that you know , that you can look very different , and you can sound a lot more .
so , just like this , the words that we use in the language of political ambiguity is always using .
actually , we know something else is the case .
but we know if we &apos;re the spelling , the social parts are very sensitive to the social state .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to do things like this in a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
so i want to argue to you what we found in my institute .
after what logic , these funerals , the willingness to address another reality , the other reality that we &apos;re actually in the unconscious knowledge is that they &apos;re going to be able to spread out .
so i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is ahead of what many of you know and some of you appreciate , very few of them don &apos;t need to do all of it .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is so kind of intellectual , says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not about stop , physical nature .
and if you have people who are the solid belief , they have a soul , or you can say that they have been brought to life , then they ask that they &apos;re just like the soul of the mental framework , not matter , and they &apos;re just a little bit more of the face of the world , and they &apos;re just a little bit more of the matter of the face of the world .
and from that soul , you think that somehow you kind of in this cloudy nature , in this particular , nature of nature , is called the latin , the core , the present , present .
and then when this kind of squid data hits the people , he &apos;s filled with dignity , with spirit , with nature , that can only live , and just with soul .
and then he can just get a little bit of time .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so she &apos;s supposed to come from the outside to people .
so we should be able to perceive them as something that is desperately for our lives .
and if you have this premise , you understand the logic that we &apos;re experiencing , with a lie , to make our world better .
because now you can apply a solar system .
you know , you know , it &apos;s from school .
this is a little bit of a string of mine that describes us a logic .
this is the hardest part of my talk .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
because to lie that they can just apply this logic to be wrong .
in this particular , three sentences come to get .
the first sentence is , there &apos;s no soul , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , if you &apos;re right , it &apos;s not a soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i came up with it in particular .
a third sentence that &apos;s immediately represented with people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have a soul , which is dead and can &apos;t say anything .
and you &apos;re feeling it here .
here &apos;s the logic that &apos;s in this , yes , in this particular talk , talking about this .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences , these are logical things .
so i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a claim about reality .
i can say , the most powerful is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the most powerful man is a man .
if i don &apos;t have a right , then the most powerful man is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter what &apos;s true .
i can claim everything .
but crucial , if i have right , it &apos;s just true .
so if you &apos;re talking , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have a soul .
these things are logical .
and now our favorite awareness is comfortable with the mind , and you can do something .
it depends on a third sentence that doesn &apos;t have to do with the first two sentences and the way that the first sentence is already proved , and it &apos;s a very appealing thing .
because we have to prove , yes , whether there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that it just uses that two sentences are correct , and a third of the brain , which looks like he would have to do with it , we can save our own business system .
so , we do , as if it &apos;s impossible to be able to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can continue to continue these things on different examples .
in the present , we have a modern example of the world that &apos;s going to be filling up the most sophisticated .
this is what you have to do with another philosophical topic , a more powerful view of philosophy , mind .
that &apos;s what we have to do in the south century .
there was a scholars who was named johannes dunlap and after that &apos;s the most terrifying .
the most unpredictable , oddly , is a very shy one of pure nature .
that &apos;s not the soul .
this is a kind of a business of surgery .
and if you place exactly the exact same in the middle between two of the things that you put in the middle between two or a half .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a haystack he was going to go first .
so he &apos;s right in the middle .
so the most important thing is that the most important thing is .
and the power of the internet is to solve each other .
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
and if you take another example , so if you &apos;re going to get a haystack , then it doesn &apos;t need any sense and not to do anything .
it &apos;s automatically running to the right thought .
if you have this idea that you &apos;re somehow being driven in nature , you &apos;re going to be able to get out of the larger pile that you put on a instantly , and then you also have the feeling that it &apos;s going to be a free will .
and if we &apos;re here in the blink of the field , i remember the brain &apos;s office for brain science .
there &apos;s a scholars who &apos;s called wolf , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; the wolf is saying , &quot; there &apos;s no free ride .
now we can make the second sentence , and we can say , if wolf &apos;s right , he has no free free .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can do almost every day in the daily newspaper is to find that in this third sentence .
it looks like this , who doesn &apos;t have access to free , and it can &apos;t be made for the actions and claims to responsibility and therefore it &apos;s more powerful .
and you also have it again .
you actually have to prove to you if there &apos;s something like free .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this as if the first sentence of the original wrong , as you would , would be the opposite without evidence .
and now you can just do something if you want to do anything , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , this courage to practice .
do you practice that for example , if you &apos;re a human being , you can tell you , there &apos;s no more powerful .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for the news of the day , called prophet .
you can &apos;t call that , that would be a little political , then you can see that .
say , there &apos;s no more sophisticated .
immediately , they &apos;ll be able to get to the top of that kind of thing , and they &apos;re not going to be able to prove that you can &apos;t prove .
and they have a problem .
because while they &apos;re busy , they &apos;re told that they cannot prove that there &apos;s no more powerful , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s fooled .
because he has led them to a wooden array that he doesn &apos;t get to themselves .
because actually , this human being isn &apos;t interested in evidence .
it &apos;s only interested in the need to be able to get herself to the need to prove that there are a lot of time to prove that there &apos;s a lot of time .
so , in the way , you experience the evidence of the evidence of the lie .
and once again , if you have a way to feel this , to feel like you can do this , you can do it , because you &apos;re going to do other people , if you don &apos;t remember it , if you don &apos;t remember it on your own side of your own .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve allowed myself to ask me if i can mention it .
she &apos;s one of the most powerful paintings here , and i asked if i would give a lecture here and my idea of my idea .
i have to say , you &apos;ve got it , you know , it &apos;s hard to talk about my idea .
and i may think i &apos;m going to think of you as a little bit of my favorite thing .
but it &apos;s the sum of the whole , many ideas .
i &apos;m probably , you know , the two nice girls are still there , i &apos;m probably one of the generation that &apos;s been taken for this bad image , because i &apos;ve started studying robotic engineering in a field of engineering , engineering school , and i think that &apos;s what i think is a kit .
and i went to berlin , and i was going to go back to berlin , because i wanted to make renewable energy and that was not in the street of the street .
there was the most powerful of the brain .
the phoenix islands at the time was the most violent thing called the internet .
the hot days today .
because a good engineer either built a great car or a good user .
but this is what the kind of thing that &apos;s like , like &apos; n , is coming out of a hundred watts from the square , which was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy kind of crazy thing .
i &apos;m grateful to the most grateful that he has the word again again , because after the most violent , you didn &apos;t use the word anymore , because everything left was bad .
but that was not that in the most violent years .
there was so much that there was a lot of time , and one of them was sitting in the street of the street , where you thought that evil .
the place of the brain , but that was called the , and it was made , and it was made , and i started in the mid- &apos; 80s .
and yes , a lot of what was said today , i really touched , because many , many beautiful expressions were that i &apos;ve been working in .
i &apos;ve worked at 11 years in the collective , which was a little bit of a sudden .
we were 20 people .
if one of them said , &quot; no , the most powerful , &quot; which has a completely valid , i have a hard job for a decade , if i really had my great career , because i &apos;ve been doing my father &apos;s office , because all the colleagues of my father have always been to the window of the window .
it &apos;s been a bit of a cruel .
and that was really , very , very , very , very , very , very , very early in the room , and it &apos;s just a picture that i &apos;ve been asked to take out of a few years , a thousand years of , and i was going to be a thousand years old , and that &apos;s what the great thing should be .
and i then have to go to the street , and then we have a senior with friends , i &apos;ve become compost the company , which then became the most powerful of the world &apos;s most powerful of the world &apos;s largest population of the world .
one of the things that we have , of course , is , of course , the problem of growing and we have a little bit of a growing company , and we decided that we &apos;re going to start little and then we think it &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s going to happen again , and that &apos;s what it is , and it &apos;s the same thing that people say , what &apos;s going on , it &apos;s going to be crazy .
and i brought you a project that i want to introduce you to now .
and the title of the talk was , yes , as you get too 100 percent renewable .
and we just started asking a relatively special story , where you could have a memory of the way that you &apos;re going to use a memory of memory today .
on this island , that &apos;s the island of the island of the water .
yeah , that &apos;s the data .
there are four thousand people living there .
now , these have renewables today from 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
it &apos;s just technological not .
if you add more wind to each other , the system begins to fail .
i &apos;m always telling politicians to be able to do the local , if they &apos;re in the refugee .
so , the name is , why ?
we &apos;ve already got 20 percent in germany .
it can &apos;t be a problem at all .
but , not , we &apos;ve seen seven percent and our net is physically seen the european sea .
if we had 20 percent , we would have the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was just , just ask that was the first to have the first contact , and i just wanted to calculate the first contact .
as big as big , because it &apos;s actually a battery that you have to have a island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent renewable .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go again .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the way , by a year , roughly a hundred decibels of electric performance on the world , it &apos;s widely packed on the world .
that &apos;s the performance of a hundred nuclear power , because it &apos;s very fast everywhere .
the world &apos;s favorite world , which is being deleted with petrol , because you don &apos;t need permission .
that &apos;s fast .
you &apos;re like , &quot; a box . &quot;
and then it looks like this .
in the run , three of the most popular , two will always wait .
yeah , this is the bottom of this , the load is the burden .
we also have very very precise data .
and the main way or the solar system or whatever it is , is basically a system of a system or a system , which can only be in small quantities of the world .
our goal was to just say , okay , okay .
the water spill is going to be the root , the wind , sun , the load of the load that they can map the larger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , so energy per year , not the performance in the moment , you have to turn the water off .
that means that the moment you have to do the renewables that can take the entire web .
you can only get that if you get done in some kind of way .
nobody has done this on the world .
that &apos;s what we have in the small style , so you can also use your car to use your own little blood system .
people always ask me what &apos;s going on in the field of time , because in the blink of the world ?
that &apos;s already .
but if you want to get multiple of these online pieces and you want to build a net , it &apos;s going to be extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to get to 70 to ninety percent renewable and then still stay here , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , that will be very , very expensive , and it &apos;s not going to work that you make it out of batteries .
that will be a fuel net , which then , hydrogen , methane , power , you know , or sh , will be familiar with it .
you have to go to a more , and you &apos;re not just going to get a handle and not just fix it .
we just wanted to know what is , because with a normal , highly classified battery .
how far is you going to get there ?
and then they have a whole lot of simulation .
and wind and sun and the sun and the load of the body and came to the result , a very exciting outcome that you need to take a middle of the conventional system to 20 cents a middle of the year that takes about 50 cents a gallon .
these were the first calculation six years ago .
and then we said , okay , we said .
so , it &apos;s great , we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper as the most powerful , when the most of the year is going up five percent per year .
and then we started to negotiate with the most sophisticated .
what would everything have to be done ?
have investors negotiate with investors , i &apos;ve looked for new york projects .
we were only at the time , just five people to rebuild the society .
and here &apos;s the plot .
the brown is the conventional system , the green is our system .
that our system has a system of energy , because we &apos;re still doing 20 percent with petrol , and also a more responsible thing to do on the other things .
and the most popular thing that the most powerful the island of the island has been , we know , that we &apos;re very great .
let &apos;s also support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin where we can sort of map the electric aspects of the island in the scale of one three to three very closely .
that means we &apos;ve got to find the largest battery in the world .
here she is .
it comes from asia , in the case of japan .
and the most common thing is , in the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , the bbc &apos;s first time , and it became the world &apos;s japanese , and then it became a japanese restaurant .
it &apos;s you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has a number of performance and six hours for that performance , and that &apos;s the battery that we kind of have a little bit of carbon dioxide .
and then they put them together .
we also have one of these most powerful things in the same size , as he says in the hall to actually be the full dynamic behavior of this web , so in the back of the hall , it &apos;s the big battery that we simulate the net .
so here &apos;s the whole thing that we &apos;re going to do over here , the whole thing that &apos;s the wind , the cable , to represent the internet &apos;s net .
and you can see this all over here .
we can also eliminate two kilowatts of unpleasant improbability on the web .
here we see this again , again , the water , again , the whole , the single , individual , individual .
and what we &apos;ve done since the last year was the hall , then the hall was finished , until today , what &apos;s between the individual system , to develop in software , we did .
so we &apos;re not a corporate , but we &apos;re actually redefining as a company that &apos;s only between the subject of battery and the subject of web and everything in between .
you have to communicate to the battery , you have to communicate to the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is that you &apos;re basically in this island today , and it &apos;s all the most important to be able to do that , if we want to increase our numbers of renewables .
so this whole discussion , like going back , is going to go back and forth , the way that you want to go , for example , have the island of the island , for example , for the cost of the oil , and we &apos;re going to be blowing the wind and the sun .
and then , the point is that it &apos;s going to be a little bit of time .
so , a computer designer , a computer game everywhere .
we can start to integrate in the island , to integrate , to integrate , and then , you can manage the burden .
that means if you &apos;re in 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can go through the n , you can go through the nets , yes , you should do that , you know , the percentage of the brain , but you can never get rid of memory completely .
and that &apos;s the message of the n .
so , many people come to come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn the water out , you don &apos;t have these spinning mass , which is a certain inertia of the web .
and our main business is basically being made of louder amounts of large power of large power , where the wave all over europe is over europe .
we look inside this web , looking at 50 hertz , and when it &apos;s going to be nine hertz nine hertz , we start a few more nuanced , and then we &apos;ll get a little bit of a fiber , then we &apos;ll get up again .
this is the system .
and of course , this is incredible , of course .
if you go somewhere , it takes a very long time .
the main reserve is at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in time , they can respond again .
if you don &apos;t have that , these spinning mass , you have to replace that with the computer and the more powerful .
and we can actually put two milliseconds of these big battery two milliseconds .
there &apos;s a lot of the big design that there is .
and the message is , we have to get rid of these rotating masses , if we kind of , like , 20 , 20 , 20 , 20 , 30 , 30 percent , 30 , 30 percent and so on .
then we have to break our capacity to break our energy capacity .
so , the power station is just going to run the power station to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a moment of a moment , and it &apos;s a moment of the computer , because we don &apos;t , or the other , because it &apos;s not .
and we &apos;re just trying to tell you that you can do the capacity to break the capacity to break down the capacity , and you can also get your memory into the net .
now , there &apos;s a whole lot of studies that we &apos;re now in .
and then the purpose of the people always come and look at our own business of our own , sort of our own business .
and yes , the discussion always goes to the question , how far you can get a piece of the future in the future .
and many discussions that i had in the last six years was similar to the discussion that i had in the last 30 years , for the last 30 years .
isn &apos;t it , is the hyperbole , the , we have all of them , never have a chance .
we have 30 decibels today in germany .
this is a huge way .
and i just go out of that , we &apos;re going to store the same capacity for the next 30 years , and we will have the same capacity in the world .
just just that &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s a whole lot of the data of the data and arguments .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve probably experienced the last two years in the last two years that scientists are asking to my side .
we &apos;ve got over 10 million cellular years now , also to the german web now to the german web .
this is going to be in the next april .
so , from that , you also realize that there is a change there , and only from this kind of thing to be able to do , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable , yes .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a kind of a system of dopamine .
now , in arguments , it &apos;s always trying to do this , these miniature , which are going to be a little bit of a small net , which has a little bit of a small net , which has nothing to do with our own business .
the question is , it &apos;s very easy to do if you &apos;re completely independent of some fossil or a half of the fossil , which will be in the world , and you &apos;re going to be able to be a island .
then they just use the thing that &apos;s on the sun and wind there , where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a global energy supply and i &apos;m thankful by cradle to say , solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and in the way that we come from , the talk of the internet &apos;s point is that you may be a collective and using solar energy , here &apos;s a little bit together .
and yes , i just want to encourage you to be quiet in the sense that you can be quiet a little bit , and you may have a vision .
and you really have to stay quite tough , but i think it &apos;s going .
thank you .
when steve lopez , the los angeles times , a day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a committed , a professional , tough , tough homeless , homeless the violin that had only two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from the paper article , it was a book that was called a book that was called the back of the day , and robert lopez was a geneticist , and he was finishing by the very promising career , and he was finishing by his most unusual early , very early early to his shoulder .
nathaniel left 24,000 , suffered a breakdown and 30 years later he lived as homeless the streets of the street row in los angeles .
i recommend reading all of you , and looking at the movie , so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that was born between these two men , but also , as the music was making this connection , and how it was the instrument that was going to get the instrument , and the thing that was going to get the price of the road , nathaniel , nathaniel away from the street .
i met mr. dunlap in 2008 two years ago in walt , in the walt disney hall .
he had just heard a presentation of beethoven &apos;s first symphony and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine .
he spoke in a very , very troubled and entertaining sound about yo-yo derek and hillary clinton and about how the dodgers never could do it in the world series of beethoven &apos;s world , and that &apos;s because of the world &apos;s favorite synthesis of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
we came to talk about music . and a few days later , i got an email , which was that nathaniel was in the front of me for a lot of time .
i have to say that nathaniel was going to be a medical treatment , because it was already with electrical electrical and with a lot of plastic and flexible and flexible , an trauma that he has been tracking his whole life .
as a result , he &apos;s particularly vulnerable to this schizophrenic stages , and that &apos;s sometimes bad , and it &apos;s a little bit of time after days , and he &apos;s going to put in the streets of the street row , always that horror and the most powerful of his own spirit .
and in fact , in fact , nathaniel , as we started with our first class in walt disney hall , he started this crazy kind of thing in the back of his eyes and was completely lost .
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and about how somebody wanted to poison in sleep .
i was afraid , not a little bit , but i was afraid that i could lose him , that he could sink in his condition , and that i could destroy him his relationship to the violin , if i started to talk about scales and the other exciting forms of the brain .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s first sentence .
and while i was playing , i fell on a complete change , and i was going to be a complete change .
it was as if he was under the impact of a invisible drug , a chemical response that was a catalyst my game .
and the most disturbing anger turned out to be a calm curiosity and grace .
and as through a miracle , he took his violin and started to play some clips of the plastic , and then asked me to play them , and then they would go to the end of the day , and they would be able to play , the computer , the computer , the computer , the computer , the computer .
we started talking about music , started from bach , and i began to shave , and all the other people , and the other , of the other , from the sun to go to the street , to the wild .
and i realized that he didn &apos;t just know a little bit about music , but it was also a tight personal relationship with her .
he talked about her with a passion and understanding that i was going to know about my colleagues in the abalone arena of los angeles .
by doing music , and talking about music , was made from this kind of thing , confused man , who was still under the streets of los angeles , a computer , a great , great , great , glorious musician .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means emotional health .
because the music allows him to be the thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity in a real way .
and so he &apos;s going to be the shortest condition .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
this is why we do music : so we do something that is in all of us , deep inside our feelings , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of this term is that all of us , and it &apos;s inspired , inspired and online .
what nathaniel set up , so it brought him back to a community of friends .
the power force of music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood his talent and he had a lot of data .
and i &apos;m always going to do with nathaniel music , whether in the walt disney hall or in a row , because he reminds me why i &apos;ve become musicians .
thank you .
bruno &apos;s office : thank you . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i have stolen the most powerful .
i hope you forgive me .
so i &apos;ve known many fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first , that was more like a passionate kind of a passionate form .
it was a beautiful fish , a good fish , good consistency , a library of the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was being bred in the most of the most common standards of sustainability .
so you could feel that you could sell it .
i had a relationship with this beauty a lot more months .
one day , the head of the company called the company , and i said , &quot; could i be telling myself about the sustainability of the farm ? &quot;
&quot; of course , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what this kind of thing has become , which has become the unimaginable problem for our cooks ? how do we keep fish on our followers ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve collapsed the oceans as we got bare to cut .
it &apos;s hard to make the destruction of the .
90 percent of the big fish that we love , the tunas , the northern , the most prolific , is deleted , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , maybe some of the things that are going to be , or bad , is a part of our future .
many arguments against it . the environment , the environment , most of you , and you &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a video of 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds of water are necessary to get a pound of a pound .
not very sustainable .
don &apos;t taste very well .
so finally , there was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to supported them .
on the day before the event , i called the pr director of the pr company .
let &apos;s don &apos;t call it .
don &apos;t don &apos;t say , &quot; i just said , &quot; just to have the facts , you &apos;re famous for the way that you grow out in the ocean , that you don &apos;t get rid of the environment . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out of our fish that will be distributed , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
and this is a &quot; -- &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
and then one , great .
&quot; then to one thing ? what is your smoke feeding ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
and at that night , i was in bed and thought , what to hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , don &apos;t stop .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you don &apos;t don &apos;t know what to do ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he will be longing .
now , i &apos;m going to put a couple of people in the company . no one could give me a cash answer to the senior student , until finally the senior president was practicing .
let &apos;s also stop it .
&quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; what for example are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some of the things that he said , and then he said , &quot; well , the name of it .
i said , &quot; well , do you know ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , the air , dried up , dry and to eat . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your body &apos;s eye is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , these are about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you don &apos;t stop feeding chicken on fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i &apos;m going to get to this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a computer scientist and i &apos;m a computer scientist .
i actually am .
no , i &apos;ve actually got a fish of this fish , because , i swear to god , the fish that i tasted in the conversation after chicken .
this second fish , that &apos;s a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the romantic way that you know , the better you know your fish , you love the fish , the more you love the more .
i was eating it first in a restaurant in a restaurant .
a journalist famous , a long time ago , talked about this fish .
it &apos;s a kind of time of interest .
he came on the table with a bright , almost white color .
the chef had him .
hold twice .
amazingly , he still was delicious .
who can make a fish so good after it became a little bit of time ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call it sterile . actually , he &apos;s called conflicting .
and no , he didn &apos;t cook the fish and he &apos;s not a chef , at least the way they and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist in northern la la .
this is a very reactive in the world of spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of the body .
they grew up in the way they were basically wetlands .
they did that by turning the country .
they built these complicated episode of channels , and they cut water out of the country and out of the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t do that that was working , not economically .
and the green was a disaster .
it took about 90 percent of the birds to do what they &apos;re doing for this place .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company bought with the country .
what did they do ?
they &apos;re the melting of water to the water .
they literally cleaned the lever .
instead of using water , they used the channels to put the water back .
they &apos;re making the channels .
they created a 11,000 acres of rice -- -- the baby , shrimp , shrimp , shrimp -- and the kind of , sterile and his company , the ecological destruction completely versa .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
they stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you &apos;re seeing are the canals that are , and these density , lush march .
i was not a long time ago with swollen .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a part of a crocodile to kiss .
okay ? there we were and fought through the wetlands and i was making and i got out and i got mud , and i have a sweat , and sterile , in calm , a rock game .
this is what he picks up a rare video program .
now he mentioned the most uplifting of sardinia .
and here , he sees a pattern of simulated perceptions that reminds him of the most profound giraffe .
it turns out that swollen the biggest part of his career has spent in the world &apos;s national national park in africa .
i asked him how to be a little bit of a football problem .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and falls into more talk from rare birds and algae and weird and curious .
and you don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the most amazing community , in the way that you know in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak fish on this kind of piece of delicious fish that i had on the ground .
so i cut him . i said , &quot; sterile , how does it feel that your fish are so good ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what are your fish eating ?
how is the most powerful ? &quot;
now , he goes to me to tell that it &apos;s a very rich system that the fish eat , which they would eat in the wild .
the root biomass , the phytoplankton , the zoo , that &apos;s what the fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely more sinister .
there &apos;s no food .
the one farm , who &apos;s not feeding their animals ?
later , i went on on this site with swollen around this site , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be so , &quot; what &apos;s it like to be ? &quot;
and it was when a movie director would have a grant .
and we have the corner of the corner and we had the most incredible sight , thousands and thousands of pinker , literally a literally anonymous carpet , so far the eye enough .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your own favorite card , pink .
they &apos;re going to be . &quot;
so , i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; sterile , you don &apos;t have your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and the birds .
now last year , 600,000 birds were over 600,000 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s become the largest and one of the most important private health systems in europe .
i said , &quot; well , is it a good thing not to be a good thing to do , the last thing you want to have on a football board ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building the way we &apos;re building , not intense .
this is a hardware network .
the tar cells eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the hype .
so the rebellion the gut the better the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s think of this . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals and a farm that measures your success to your health of the predators .
a computer company , but also a computer company .
oh , and by the way , these were the most important things that we should be there .
they breed in 240 miles away where the most powerful is better for the most violent .
every morning they fly 240 miles to the farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles .
they do that because they can follow the white white line of the highway .
seriously .
i had introduced a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at it .
i said , &quot; sterile , fly , do you go back to the farm and then go back to the night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me as if i was quoted just a song from whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you &apos;re doing it because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish , the delicious , and i don &apos;t like a fish . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this kind of squid , the taste of taste .
i &apos;m almost cooking for it .
and yet , when i tried to put them in this restaurant in the restaurant in a comic , she didn &apos;t tasted it at all .
she liked sweet and she would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned this to sterile and he &apos;s going to be relieved .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense , before something in the body .
she has developed over evolution to be exposed to the evolution of the world . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no idea . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed your fish . a farm that measures your success successfully .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a drug scientist , he &apos;s got enormous , because the water is flowing through this farm from the river .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things to that , which is the rivers that are now to lead to , chemical pollutants , flow of water .
and if it &apos;s fought by the system and that leaves the water , it &apos;s clean than it &apos;s the equivalent of it .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not only one farm that doesn &apos;t feed their animals , not only one farm that measures their success of their rights of their predators , but a farm that is literally a single , and not only for you , and i &apos;m going to be .
because if the water is blowing up , it &apos;s the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this love , as romantic , is also the premise .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about the world &apos;s disease or the other .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food of food .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
we &apos;re not a corporate , we &apos;re a city of diamonds . we &apos;re a lover .
we love farmers . we love small amounts of food . we &apos;re talking about regional food . we eat organic .
and if you say that the things that are the future of good food is somebody somewhere , and says , &quot; hey people , i love the most powerful , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;ve been producing enough calories to feed the world more than only .
a billion people are starving today .
one billion -- this is more than ever -- because of the inequalities of inequalities in the distribution , not the gas gas .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because they &apos;re the logic of our online technology , the last 50 years .
food crops on herbivores , the more of the dna , chemicals on earth , and the whole time , the whole time , has the agribusiness just asked , &quot; if we feed more people , how awful can that be ? &quot;
this was the cause . it was the kind of challenging . it was the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a craft in a refugee service , a craft that &apos;s going to be able to get more environmental capital that allows them to do exactly this production .
this is not an craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our main business is threatened today , not due to the long-term growth system , but because of the resources of resource .
not by the latest industrial and industrial , but by fertile land , not by pump , but by fresh water , not by contaminated , but by the forests of water , it &apos;s not by the contaminated , but by the fish in the sea .
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the future for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in the field of being able to do it and never really make a good thing to eat .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is that that we have to do for two billion years of expertise .
look at sterile farmers like swollen , like swollen .
businesses that are not the worlds for themselves , businesses that are trying to restore , rather than a lot of people who are building , are the ones who are not just doing a lot of people , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones who are also experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , they &apos;re a better chef than i will ever be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to warn you today about the fact that the whole data that we consume is bigger than the sum of your parts and instead of thinking about it , i think that you can think about how we can use information that &apos;s not really visible .
so , what we see here is a typical of old people taking old old .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called a game of the game , and what i can do with the ted revolution is that i can filter for a certain cause of death , we &apos;re going to say accidents .
and i immediately see a different pattern that makes it happen .
and that &apos;s because in the most remote part of the people , people are active and they &apos;re over here on the ground .
we can go out and move out the data and see the data and see that the usual suspects are the usual suspects , but not for anyone .
now , if we go on and go to age , we &apos;re going to see 40 years or younger , we see that accidents should even be the cause of people who should worry about .
and who &apos;s going to see that it &apos;s true that it &apos;s true of men .
so you see that this is a way of looking at information and data in this way , and it &apos;s really remembered in a living area .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not for content itself ?
now what we have here is the most powerful person &apos;s own sport , which has ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can just test it to my talk in your own room .
with a decade of time , you can break into a decade .
you can break into a certain year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now , if i look at the athletes here , i see the athletes that appear in this sort of thing and sports .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i click here , so i &apos;ll just stop with this thing that lance armstrong is going to be mentioned .
now , if i want to get a real track of view , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at everything with the subject of a car race ? &quot;
so i go back to a step and i &apos;m going to go back to the view .
now i see greg m. .
and so you get an idea that if you &apos;re going to get on this kind of information , more specifically , more diverse , zoom , you don &apos;t just look for it or advise you just just .
you do something that is actually a little different .
it &apos;s something between and we think it changes the way that information can be used .
so i want to do this idea a little bit more , with about what &apos;s a little crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single single single single single single one , and it &apos;s reduced to a small summary .
the summary contains a short headwind and a symbol of the area that comes from it .
i just just show the top 500 of the top line of the top .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the issues that are on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the government .
now , after i chose government , i know that the most important , the most important , is that the time that &apos;s going to be said , &quot; people of the year &quot; are the people &apos; year .
this is really important , because this is a realization that is not in a single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single single .
that &apos;s just to see if you go back and look at the whole thing .
so , looking at a specific of these summaries , i can go to the subject of time , &quot; people of the year , &quot; and see all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i know that the majority of it are , and some of them come from science . some of them , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss .
and interestingly , bono is a ted prize winner .
so we can jump now and look at all ted prize winner .
you see , we &apos;re at the net , the first time it &apos;s really a web , not just to the side of the side , but much more abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
i just show you the new york times the new york times .
so , the tools that i &apos;m not going to call this a browser -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not browser , but you can look at websites with each other -- and we bring these pieces of stuff to each single website like this .
so i can go back to a step , and jump directly into a specific unit .
so that &apos;s why you &apos;re just looking at the websites in this kind of way , and that &apos;s the same way that you can look at the same kind of stuff in the same way .
so i can zoom in in my course in a particular scale .
here &apos;s the whole demonstration of the whole demonstration i &apos;ve thought of here .
and i can sort of see anything i &apos;ve seen today , again , again .
and , if i look at a step of time and look at everything , i can actually reinvent my course of the way i think i &apos;m going to be able to get to the ted lab , and here i went to the search of the road , and here i went to a new school factory , or here after a new geographic factory .
and i can go from here to the side and come back to it .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used again , and every time it &apos;s going to make the big picture of the body .
right now , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the rockefeller headquarters .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going to another , we start to go from a different to a different , and to get patterns , which otherwise would be hidden ?
if we can do this , then this past thing will be made , maybe a new source of information .
and , instead of moving into information , we can get to know that .
and if we know , then maybe we can even get wisdom from it .
so i hear , thank you very much .
i grew up with a high science science fiction fiction .
i went to school with the bus , and every day , a day every day , every day .
and my nose always put in a book , a computer company that my thought in other worlds , and in the way my mind , in other worlds , are actually , in my own , tasty curiosity .
and this curiosity was also showing that i was always , if i wasn &apos;t in school , through the forests of the forests , and they were collecting , and they were sending frogs , frogs and snakes and bugs and the microscope .
i was totally embarrassed , you know .
it always went to try to understand the world and the limits of the possible perspective .
and my love to science fiction seemed to be in my environment , because then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and studied the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world showed us of wonder that we never had before .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to do very well at the same time .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there &apos;s no video video that &apos;s going to film that video video with a computer-generated game , which had the whole imagery in the media landscape , i had to create the images in my head .
we had to all do that then , if we were reading a book , we took the description of the author and the experimenter , and we put them on the screen in our heads .
my response to this was drawing and paint from aliens , aliens , aliens , robots , and all this stuff .
in math class , i became caught from the teacher , as i was hiding , in the textbook , the way i was hiding .
creativity had to be out of creativity .
and something interesting happened . which is what i showed in jacques chaplin &apos;s shows was the thought of a completely unknown world on our earth itself .
i &apos;m sure i would never have a alien world with a spaceship , which seemed quite unlikely .
but here was a world that i could actually enter here on the earth , and she was equally fascinating and exotic like all that i imagined was reading as i had read these books .
so i decided to be 15 , and i was going to see the two .
the only problem that i was in a small village was that i lived in a small village from the next ocean .
i didn &apos;t get frustrated with that .
i &apos;m going to put my father , until finally , in buffalo , new york , found , just on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my favorite coach in a pool of the middle in the middle of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , a real ocean , got to face two years later , when we moved to california .
since then , 40 years , the age of 40 years , i spent about three hours of water under water , and 500 hours of it in submersibles .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the ocean &apos;s ocean , is so rich in the ocean , as we can really imagine , we can &apos;t do it .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know boundaries , unlike our own , in contrast human imagination .
until today , i feel deepest awe for what i see on my dives .
and my love to the ocean is holding up with the same intensity as well as ever .
when i was a teacher , it was a career .
that seemed the best way to tell my inner taste , stories to create the same thing , to create pictures .
as a child , i was drawing books constantly and so .
so films were the way to bring pictures and stories , and that fit together .
of course , the stories i &apos;m going to do was , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; the &quot; left . &quot;
&quot; the left &quot; i could connect my preference for the air and that &apos;s where i was going to connect with the aorta .
so , basically , my two passions .
something interesting happened in the left : to solve a problem in this movie -- and that &apos;s what we had to create a liquid liquid , and we made a computer-generated liquid , and we made it a computer-generated simulation , back , back .
what came out of this was the first computer-generated map that was ever seen in a movie .
the film was not a money , and he was told , just he was saying his costs , but i realized something fascinating : the audience on the world was like mesmerized , which went out of this .
according to arthur clarke , the law is known as a rule of law , and magic is not to distinguish any other .
so they saw something magical .
and i found that incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s what it really needs to be involved in the most violent . &quot;
so we went in &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , a lot more .
together with a computer , we created the guy from liquid metal , and the success was very , very much about how this effect would come .
and it worked . again , we had created a magical thing , and the effect in the audience was the same thing , but we have a little bit more money with the film .
from these two experiences , a whole new world was achieved , a whole new world of creativity for the world of creativity .
so i started a company , with my good friend stan , who was the best of the best ever ever , and i was the best of the day , and she was called digital design .
the idea of this company was it , the phase of analog processes , with visual printers , and start to start with digital design .
and we did that , and we managed to give a advantage of a impact for a while .
but the mid- &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in the middle of the country and we were doing the business of what we were doing , and we were actually starting to get the company to slow down .
i had written this piece of avatar , which is the lighting in things of visual effects and the internet effects in all sorts of new heights , expressive characters , using expressive human beings , using the very strong human , expressive characters , which were made by the surface of the world .
but the noise of the stick is very good back , and people in my company said that we &apos;re not able to be able to do that .
so i shifted this and made this other film about the big ship that goes down .
i sold this as &quot; cbs and julia on a ship , &quot; and it became a kind of a prehistoric epic shift , a passionate film .
but i was actually trying to go to the real ridge of the titanic .
so i made the film .
this is the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but i believe it , by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to go to the train . we &apos;re going to go to the real exit .
we &apos;re going to show it in the movie of the film .
this is incredibly important . it &apos;s a good thing for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but that &apos;s back to that , that the own imagination can create reality .
we actually created six months later , a reality where i was in a russian village in a russian motel , four miles under the surface of the north atlantic , and i looked at the real titanic through a computer .
this was not a movie , no one , that was real .
so , that really blew me up .
and the level of effort was enormous . we had to build cameras and lights and make everything .
and i noticed how much of these things , a more similar one .
well , they were also also more sophisticated and more sophisticated to the more sophisticated .
you go up into this capsule , you go into this dark , hot environment , where no hope is on saving , if you can &apos;t get it back .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i was in a training store .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was actually obsessed with exploring the deep sea .
anyway , that part of the part that i have to do with curiosity and science , it was all . it was an adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that could not give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could create a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was going to see outside the window .
in some of the new expeditions , i &apos;ve seen creatures in northern kenya , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that had never seen before and for the science of the time when we saw them , still didn &apos;t have words .
so that &apos;s really what i &apos;m going to do right now , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
after the success of &quot; titanic &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my favorite card as a filmmaker in hollywood , and it will be a while for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we were starting to come to the &quot; guide , &quot; and they were exploring with the computer .
we went back to the backside of the titanic .
we took small robots that we built , which was a more powerful one .
our intention was , to look at the inner and the inside of the ship , which was never been done before .
nobody had explored the inside of the body &apos;s inside . so , we had no means of the ability to do that . so we developed the technology .
and i &apos;m sitting there , and i &apos;m sitting on the deck of the titanic , in a computer scanner , and you see towers that are quite similar to this kind of thing , and i know that once the band has played there .
and i fly with a little bit of a little bit of a glass ship through the ship .
i &apos;m actually supporting it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically inside of the titanic of the titanic .
this was the kind of the form of a football form that i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i turn up to a corner , i always knew what was going on in the middle of the vehicle , because i went to film months when we finished the film .
and the set was a very precise copy of the hull of the ship .
so that was a very strange experience .
she made me consciously be aware of this kind of thing that you use to use such a kind of brain experience and your consciousness in the vehicle , in these other forms of existence .
it was really immensely profound .
and maybe a little spot on what might happen in some decades , if you have a little bit of time to explore something or to do something else , to do something like that , and to do things like a design of the other , which i can imagine as a master .
after these expeditions , we started to see what we saw down there , really , for example , this particular , for example , this particular thing , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . that &apos;s kind of alien , but here on earth .
they &apos;re living with the help .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight system , as we do .
and so you see animals that are directly called a 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
and i was also interested in the same time for the most violent , which was again the most violent of my childhood .
and so i ended up with the people who care about the space and to do the nasa and in the most of the time , and they &apos;re going to be able to go through russia , through the mission , and take a walk , and take a walk , and take a ride , and take a fly , and take our hands with the international design system .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was that i was going to take a lot of time to get into the deep sea .
i took them to the world , and i gave them access to the world , and the way they were interested in the world , and i took them to the extreme situations , and i took them to the vents , so i took them to take the source , and test them and test the tools so on .
we were doing yoga , but actually , science , i was doing , was more honest .
so the circle of my existence was as a child &apos;s body , as a child , and the way to do it in reality .
i &apos;ve learned a lot of discovery in this voyage .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m sure now , you know , a director , you can also have to be a leader like a car or something like that .
i don &apos;t understand much of leadership before i &apos;m going to get these expeditions .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s out there ? &quot;
this ingenuity movies don &apos;t bring us money .
we &apos;re playing the cost of the cost of fame .
all of you think i &apos;m between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and i would have a ball of nails on a beach on the beach .
i &apos;ve all made these movies , these kisses , for a very small audience .
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it about the task to the challenge , and the ocean is the most powerful environment that you have . you &apos;re doing it , and because of the strange connection , which is when a small group of people form a team .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who have been working for years , and sometimes we were two to three months of sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is that the chance that you have before each other is because you have a job overcome , which you can &apos;t explain to any other .
if you go back to the land , and say , &quot; we had to do it , the transplant simulator , the whole technology , and the difficulty , the human performance , if you work on the sea , you can &apos;t explain that . that &apos;s how to explain it , and that &apos;s how you can &apos;t explain to the police .
there is a connection that is a different sense of respect .
so when i go back to turn my next film &quot; avatar &quot; , i tried to use the same leadership , which is that you make a set of the team and make respect to the back of the race .
so that &apos;s what really changed the dynamics .
so i was going back to a little team of the unknown terrain , and we were , &quot; avatar , &quot; with a new technology that hasn &apos;t had before .
incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we became a full family for a time of four years .
so , this changed my way to make films completely .
there were people who said we had this kind of thing , and we were actually transporting these things out of the planet , and they were digging up on the planet .
for me , it was more a kind of a research way to do my job , the actual process that has changed in the result .
so what can we get from all of this ?
what lessons we learned ?
i think first of all , the curiosity is .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that even can create a reality .
and the warning of your team is more important than all of the world &apos;s population .
i come to the young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice , how i can do something like that . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t even get yourself .
they get to get to you . don &apos;t do it yourself , bet not against yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has a kind of a business machine : &quot; fail is not an alternative . &quot;
but in the art and to explore , it has to be an alternative , because it &apos;s going to have a more powerful one .
no important effort , the innovation was used , without risk .
you have to be ready to take risks on it .
this is the thought i &apos;d like to give you to the way that i &apos;m going to do it , fail , but is not a prediction , but thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and perhaps that might surprise something because my favorite business in the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds to make things that we create and provide the poorest two billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more importantly than anyone else on the planet .
so , the fact that their crops are not growing over many years , and it &apos;s not going to rain too much or not rain . things will change as it can &apos;t be their fragile environment .
it leads to the lead . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , a climate change will be terrible for you .
and also , the most important for you is very important .
in fact , if you only reduce the price of the price , the energy would be in far the most effective .
well , the most successful thing is that it &apos;s like time .
in fact , the most important thing is based on the surface of the ocean .
the main market was the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a case in the world &apos;s office , and so we have refrigerators , air , air , we can create modern materials and so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s get the price to cut -- we &apos;re going to go to a new barrier and this barrier of co2 .
co2 is the planet and the equation is actually quite clear .
they add the carbon dioxide , which leads to the most powerful and that kind of thing has a few very negative consequences . effects on the weather and maybe worse , the indirect consequence that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt and can avoid all the systems .
well , the exact exact relationship between a computer and the net that &apos;s the net and where the other consequences are , there are some of the most respected , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i &apos;ve asked the most few times , &quot; do we really have to go down near zero ?
isn &apos;t it enough or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is to go close to zero , will increase the temperature .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a 3.5 foot high truck , which has to come back under a three feet , and then you can put it in the same way .
this is what has to be , on zero .
well , we &apos;re going to be a lot of internet technology , over 26 billion tons .
every american one of the 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons of every time on the planet .
and somehow we need to create changes that are burning on zero .
it &apos;s all the way up .
only different economic changes , at all , have influenced and we have to get from the increase to reduce the increase , and we have to reduce a reduction to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of a relief . they have this thing on the left -- co2 , which you want to get zero and that &apos;s going to depend on the number of people that are using the average energy for every service and the co2 that is the average energy for every service .
so let &apos;s take a look at each factor of each factor , and we think about how we get that on zero .
probably one of these numbers has to come very close to zero .
now this is a basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
first , we have the population .
now , hydrothermal billion people live .
and it &apos;s on nine billion of the road that we &apos;re going to move to nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the most powerful and more powerful , we might probably reduce that to 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope around 1.3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
it &apos;s all that we eat , clothing , eating , fruit , heat .
these are very good things and the more powerful thing that means to make these services almost every single time .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might probably be able to do sidewalks and less use , but in average , this number will rise and get more than double , and so far more than double the number of services that are giving up per person .
here we see a very fundamental service . there &apos;s a light at home , so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their credit of their own .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
because of different successes in the world , through other ways , through new methods in the world , there are lots of services whose energy will allow some individual services to save 90 percent .
in other service , like making the manufacturing of the city , 105 hours : fourteen : the name of the -- the wright -- the wright , six : 00 : the twin , the one of the things that &apos;s much smaller .
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a factor of three or maybe even a factor of six or maybe a factor of six .
but at the first three factors , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion tons of tons of tons , and it &apos;s just not enough to go out .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that is going to be a unit of energy that &apos;s going to be a unit of energy .
it turns out that you can get that on zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every single single body of electricity for electricity today , co2 , but the renewables and the power of electricity .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need a lot of food .
now , if i use the term &quot; wonders , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and the services is a miracle .
people here have contributed to the development of many of these wonders .
usually there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to a specific date .
usually you &apos;re just next to it , and some of you are not coming .
but in this case , we have to give up , and a miracle in very short time get .
now , i wondered how can i get this really out ?
is there a natural illustration , a demonstration that &apos;s going to turn the idea of people here ?
i remembered the last year when i brought mosquitos and somehow liked people .
the idea was really , really , really , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , this was a bit of me .
i decided that this was going to be taken from fireflies to the environment here .
so here &apos;s a couple of natural fireflies .
you &apos;ve told me that you don &apos;t even bite . you &apos;re not going to even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of different types of data like this , but they don &apos;t get all of them .
we need solutions , either one or a different one that has an incredibly advanced scale and unimaginable , and although there are many directions where people are looking for , i really see five that can afford these big demands .
i &apos;ve left tides , the street , fusion , fusion and biofuels .
these might be a life-saving contribution , and if you do better than i expect , that would be great , but my punch line here is that we have to work on all those five , and we can &apos;t give them a significant problem , because they &apos;re really upset .
let &apos;s first look at fossil fuels , burning from either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do is , maybe , but that &apos;s not . you have to do all the co2 that comes out of the wild , to catch , and then get out of pressure , and then go somewhere and hope , there &apos;s still .
there are some of the things that are going on on a 60 percent -- 80 percent , but it &apos;s going to be 100 percent to get very difficult , and a consideration for the power of carbon dioxide is a big challenge , but it &apos;s a big challenge to the power of the co2 .
who will make it secure ?
who can guarantee something that literally many billion times larger than any kind of waste you can imagine from the other things that you can imagine and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so this is a hard thing .
next , the next thing .
it has three big problems , the cost of most of the world &apos;s cost , especially in the world , and the question is that you can really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human diagnosis that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the garbage ?
because even though he &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work .
the last three of the five , i put it in .
it &apos;s the renewables that are often called the power of the amount .
and also , even though it &apos;s great , although it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need a fuel -- you have some drawbacks .
one is the energy density that &apos;s producing dramatically less than the power of power .
these are the most powerful , you &apos;re talking about many of the most powerful , thousand times more area than a normal power station .
moreover , these vents are compromised .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem to be all day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be every day , and it doesn &apos;t even flow the wind .
so you have to , if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , you have a way to have energy in times when you &apos;re not available to get .
so there &apos;s great amounts of science here . there are challenges in the transmission , and if we say that the energy source outside the country is not only the technology , you don &apos;t need to only have the technology of where different .
and there &apos;s the most powerful .
and to show the dimension , i all have the kinds of batteries that are made , which is that for cars , computers , mobile phones , for everything . and i found that , with the amount of electronic energy , which is the world we &apos;re producing , and i found that all batteries are going to be producing less than 10 minutes of the world .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that will be a factor of 100 better than the approaches to time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
this is what happens when you try to say these kinds of data sources , we &apos;re going to get 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest of the rest .
if you want to survive 100 percent of it , you need an incredible color model .
now , where are we going to go : what is the right approach ?
&quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the target ?
what we need is many companies who work on this . hundreds .
in each of these five areas we need at least 100 people .
so , in many ways , they &apos;re like , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there &apos;s a lot of people there in the ted group that are already affected .
bill big has several companies under other people who have a great job called the great news system .
and the most important thing about it is that in dozens of companies , they &apos;re doing the great things and they have interesting opportunities and i try to support it .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that , perhaps surprisingly , is the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the field of innovation ; it &apos;s liquid , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry some time ago , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts are chewing out .
the most important thing that is that instead of a part of the oil system , that one percent , the most powerful , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the most powerful .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it , but you could never do it comfortable , but it would be the way that there would be modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that , yes ! with the right time , it looks like it &apos;s acting .
and because you burn this 99 percent , it &apos;s a lot better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can actually use the waste of today &apos;s treatments as a commodity system .
instead of breaking out the head , they just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is consuming gradually , a little bit like a candle .
you see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often as a traveling wave of reactor .
it really solves the most important thing .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste that 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s being burned today , so it &apos;s called uranium uranium .
the line of the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re going to get a little bit of cheap and just light , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to go forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
how should our testimony look like ?
now , let &apos;s go to the target that we need to reach and then talk about the most powerful .
many of the 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still a bit of agriculture , hopefully , and hopefully it &apos;s going to clean up and cement until then .
so to reach this 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , their own way completely , completely completely completely .
the other note says whether we use the most powerful technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great .
this is a key effect of this kind of thing .
if we go back from there , how should the 2020 look like ?
it should have the two elements .
we should use the most powerful to get care of the way to the way we get down , the less we get the more , the less , the water , and the temperature is the temperature .
but actually , this note is the things that we do not have to do completely to the big , very much , or even less important , or even less important than the other one that &apos;s the speed of innovation for this breakthroughs .
this breakthroughs , we need to be tracking with the results , and we can measure that , in the blink of , in the brain , in the brain , in the brain and the other .
there &apos;s a lot of great books to this topic .
the al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david , &quot; the air , &quot; the hot air use . &quot;
they really go through and create a frame where this can be expressed in the wide , because we need to support all sides .
there &apos;s a lot of that &apos;s going to come together .
this is a wish .
a very special wish , that we make this technology .
if you just give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could pick the president , a vaccine , and i love that wish , or i could choose that wish , which is , you know , the , i &apos;m going to take this wish .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the dig between the long time and the short term people think terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor and poor , and almost all of these two billion , are going to be very bad .
so what do we need to do ?
what do i do ?
we need to use more research for more research .
if countries are meeting in places like the world , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
you should talk to these little , and you were shocked by the little amount of money that are spent for these innovative approaches .
we need to use carbon dioxide , co2 , wireless &amp; amp ; trade is something that creates a mass of a game .
we need to spread the message .
we need to be dialogue and complete leading and the things that are going to be done by government .
it &apos;s a more important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- you can give us a sense of magnitude of this investment ?
bill gates : to take the simulation on a supercomputer , get all the great scientists that we &apos;ve done , we just need a few million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s really hard to work in the most basic million .
the hard step is building the first potato , finding another billion , which is the most powerful and the place of actually building the first one .
once the first finished thing is , when he &apos;s promised , it &apos;s all very clear , because the economy , the energy density is so different than the energy density , as we know them .
to understand that , that means to build deep in the ground almost like a vertical column nuclear fuel , that powered and then the process starts and work on the top and then work on the bottom .
so , the point is , right . now you have to new data , so there &apos;s a lot of people and lots of controls that can go wrong . this thing is where you open it and make things like that , and that &apos;s not good !
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can use it for 60 years -- think of a column -- that you bury , without all the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there , and it &apos;s burning 60 years and then it &apos;s done .
a key one , which offers a solution to the garbage .
so , the question is , yes . now , what happens to the garbage : you can sit it up -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the waste that exists already in these areas , or the data that is in these areas , and that &apos;s our transportation system .
so , what this reactors have been a problem is that what we &apos;re going to do in our fill and the dna is dramatically reduced during this process .
but as they talked about different people in the world , they &apos;ve talked about these possibilities .
where is the biggest interest , so what really do ?
so , we haven &apos;t got to put a place on a place , and there &apos;s a lot more interesting for everything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there are big interest and people in russia , india , china -- i was here and talked about how this is going to fit to the ted minister .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something to do in the direction .
this is a variant of one thing that was made .
this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor and some countries built these , therefore everyone who has a quick reactor has been working on a very rapid reactor for our first .
in your mind , is the case , and the probability of calling something like this ?
so , the computer &apos;s : well , we need one of these most powerful , recyclable things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then use 20 years to use .
this is sort of the deadline that we &apos;ve demonstrated the most striking thing that we need to follow .
and , you know , if everything goes all right , and that &apos;s a great wish , it could be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds , the same , as if their approaches works , that works for their pilots , for the sake of the industry .
and it would be best if it &apos;s going to make several , because then you could use a mixture .
in every case we need a solution .
so , let &apos;s put the big breakthroughs , is this the largest one you know ?
so , the most important thing is , a more important thing is the most important .
it would be without the most important , but the power is so much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know how much the work is that , but there &apos;s the modular method that &apos;s another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid carbon block that seems to be a little bit difficult , but maybe the one that seems to be about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the beauty is that a million times a million times a lot of energy , we say , is a more powerful and therefore , if you can deal with the problems and the cost of the world , and the cost of the power , and the cost of the power , and the cost of the country , is the power of the country and the other things .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
do we need to have a lot of time to try to try to keep the most stable stable ?
so , if you go to this situation , it &apos;s as if you &apos;ve eaten too much , and you &apos;re short at a heart attack , and what do you do ? you need to do a heart procedure or something . you might need a heart procedure .
there &apos;s a research cloud called the whole research that &apos;s related to different techniques to delay warming , so we would give 20 or 30 years longer to get us out of the world .
this is just a very basic one .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you shouldn &apos;t be working on insurance because you might be lazy , so you &apos;re eating that , because you know that one of the sex partners will save .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you take the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in a long-term field about whether you should have that , if things get faster , or that innovation takes longer than we expect .
climate change : have you a or two sentences for you to convince you ?
so , the word of the world , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
those who are doing scientific arguments are very little .
do you say there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that are moving things ?
there are very , very few things you can tell at all , from which there is a chance in a million .
the present response here is as much as aids .
you make the mistakes , and you pay for a lot later .
and so the idea , if you all have different kinds of problems , to invest in something that you only have later -- and that is that the investment is not so clear . actually , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst scenario and there &apos;s people in the rich world that look at the ipcc report and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
the fact is that these uncertainty should be worried about .
but my dream here is that if you can do economic , and at the same time , the skeptics can say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not an co2 , i wish it &apos;s not an co2 , i wish it &apos;s not an co2 , i wish it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the most violent argument that if you use all of these time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals that we can do , the other goals that we can do .
so , the real time , the actual spending for research -- say , &quot; let &apos;s say the u.s. 10 billion a year , &quot; we &apos;re going to spend more than they &apos;re doing today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
and there &apos;s other things that are not suffering .
you get too big money , and you can disagree with reasonable people if you have something that is not economically , and try to fund it . for me , most of the waste is the waste .
because it &apos;s very short , you &apos;re very short at a very short time , and i just think that &apos;s a learning curve , and i think we should try to be more things that have a lot less than being much less expensive .
if the poker thing you get is a very high , very high , you can only keep the rich .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even more than that , think .
his new design system is now : &quot; why don &apos;t you talk about this research ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to be because of his former stories associated with the most violent , but he understood that this is a very lonely group and therefore he &apos;s bringing the apple to the world .
and that &apos;s a mindset that i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , as little people will be supporting .
bill , i think i &apos;m going to talk for almost all people here , if i say , i really hope you &apos;re going to get true . thank you very much .
so , the computer member : thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , peter mcchrystal &apos;s a call called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; war . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . the biggest one is the biggest largest structure of the structure with 20 spaghetti tissue , about feet , and building a marshmallow .
the marshmallow needs to be up on the top .
and , although it really seems , it &apos;s really hard to work , because it &apos;s very fast to work on people .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i &apos;ve turned it into a design system .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , developers and architects , even with the most violent and there &apos;s something that &apos;s profound to share with the most profound sensations in nature and i want to share some of them .
usually most people start to orient themselves on the task .
they talk about how it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to be power .
then they invest a little bit in planning and organization , they draw and put spaghetti .
they &apos;re investing in the most sophisticated structure in the most sophisticated structure .
and finally , shortly before you have no time , someone takes the marshmallow and you put it gently on the top , you go back and forth , and you &apos;re crying .
but then , almost always , it &apos;s happening to a &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; for a &quot; -- &quot; because the weight of the marshmallow is causing the whole thing to bend and the whole thing .
there &apos;s a series of people who have a lot more &quot; more &quot; more frustrating , &quot; more and more of the other words , and under the worst , the fresh new water .
they lie , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and they really make a lot of stuff .
and of course , there are teams that have much more &quot; more &quot; more &quot; more &quot; more &quot; to have &quot; the world &quot; and under the best students of the world &apos;s life .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , they didn &apos;t just produce the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask , what is this ? why ? what about ?
and peter says , &quot; no one of the kids &apos;s time to be spent in the head of spaghetti water . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in the street .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that &apos;s that the fact that the fact was to get trained to find a real plan , ok !
and then it &apos;s to realize .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar with what ?
what &apos;s different is that they start with the marshmallow and building prototypes , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow on top of the marshmallow , so they have a range of the opportunity to repair the possibility of fixing the possibility .
and the way that we think of this kind of collaboration as a core is a core of a body of a football approach .
and with each trial , the kids are getting closer to what works and what doesn &apos;t .
so the performance of working with prototypes is much more , but let &apos;s see how different teams act .
the average for most of the time is to create the most of the time , and they &apos;re doing half of them , but not much , but not much , more , more powerful than the adults .
who is at the most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately .
and the tallest tree is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and they &apos;re the key to build geometric structures .
ceos are something about average , but here it will be interesting .
you &apos;re advising a behavioral administrator on the team , you &apos;re going to be more significant .
it &apos;s incredible . you see , and you can see this team will win . &quot;
you can do the predictions . why is this ?
because they have special skills of the internet .
they &apos;re pushing the process , they understand it .
and that team , which is going to melt and look at the work of the team , the performance of the team is significantly better .
and they &apos;re specialized skills and their combination of success .
if you have 10 teams , the typical thing you get , you get about six , which have the robust structures .
i tried something exciting now .
i thought we &apos;re going to get the same thing right .
so i offered a $ 10,000 dollars to the winners for the winner .
what do you think happened with these little things ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if someone had built a high construction building , he would have carried the price home .
so is it not interesting that high school levels have a strong effect ?
we repeated this practice with the same students .
what do you think happened now ?
now , they understood the advantage of the laser .
so , from the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least time .
so there are lessons for us , and we have the nature of connection and success .
you like to ask , why would someone actually invest a time to create a more powerful one ?
the reason is , i &apos;m helping digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and visual design .
and what the most important thing is , it helps you identify assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a common experience , a common language , or a common way to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested in getting to the world can visit .
it &apos;s a blog where you see the marshmallow building .
there &apos;s a more powerful there .
they find crazy examples of all the world , like people , the system , and they &apos;re building the system .
there are also also more sophisticated .
and the lesson of the lesson , i think , is actually a design sport .
it requires that we all have to take our senses to the task , and we think we use our sense of how our emotions and our feelings are in the challenge that we are .
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything that needs to take us from a &quot; a &quot; moment to a moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
do we have this machine as if we have a machine .
a big machine , a cool , cool machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to go in .
and you can go to the past , you can go to the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now .
and i ask myself what you would choose because i asked my friends in recent times , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america &quot; .
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that somehow you &apos;re kind of drawn to the foragers .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and i don &apos;t want to , because i &apos;m a explorers .
it &apos;s because opportunities don &apos;t go back to this planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that we &apos;ve ever had this planet , which is what scales they are doing : health , wealth , mobility , opportunities , declining , declining , declining , declining .
there was never a time like this .
my favorite story died all as they were 60 .
my grandparents kept this number on 70 .
my parents are the 80 on the top of the world .
so there should be better one at the beginning of my favorite story .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing .
a child that can be born in new delhi today may expect to live as long as the richest man on the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . the smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they have shaped the demographics of the earth , like not a war ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we &apos;ve crossed them . pop .
in the rich world , diseases that have millions of us before only have a generation of us , hardly yet .
so , the energy , the weather , polio ...
anybody still knows what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are responsible for scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method , things , look at whether it works , it changes , if it doesn &apos;t , it &apos;s going to change the greatest achievement of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , this is the whole good news , because there &apos;s some other problems , and they &apos;ve been saying a lot .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people on this world are hungry every day .
this number goes up , and it goes very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to fix this world .
water , the land , rainforests , oil , gas , gas , they disappear , and if we don &apos;t get out of this chaos , we &apos;re also going to go .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country that they live in , to rape .
i think we can deliver this world with energy that they don &apos;t even have destroyed simultaneously .
i think that really , and no , that &apos;s not a rocket scientist .
but this is what i &apos;m holding awake at night -- one of the things that i &apos;m awake at night . we have never needed scientific progress .
and we were also never in the situation , it &apos;s a reasonable experience of how we can now .
we &apos;re at the threshold of amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think that we have hundreds , 300 years ago , the enlightenment to find a time in which we have progress in the process of making progress in which we have about these things more powerful than now .
people are in their faith , and that &apos;s so deeply so deeply , you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth will free them .
and listen , everybody has a right on his opinion , even a right on his opinion .
but you know what they don &apos;t quite have right ?
they don &apos;t have a right on their own facts . &apos; &apos; sorry , they don &apos;t have .
and i took a while to find that .
about a decade ago , i wrote a paper about some of the new york , a little article .
and i was amazed , and i was amazed on resistance , on resistance , which is the most effective thing in the health care system in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote a paper and drove .
and soon , i wrote a paper about genetically engineered food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i also wrote a paper about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; the &quot; -- &quot; why they thought molecules were going to a certain kind of random way of moving a light on the ground .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept doing it .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re going to be going to eat , we &apos;re going to eat that .
but this article made me worry , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these crabs who were nuts at all were not a fanatics at all .
these were the people who were educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that took me so mess ...
but then i thought , you know what , we &apos;re honest .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as used .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking about ironic , with small quotes , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what reasons are .
we have the trust in institutions in authority , and sometimes in the science of being lost , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
chernobyl , the challenger , the challenger , the challenger , mass destruction , the most violent 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people that we believed that they were always right . are they skeptical .
ask questions , demand evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything like that .
but now , if you have to get evidence , you have to take this evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can say that , in a epidemic , we &apos;re going to live in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully never will see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that the most violent , the mating , and the treatment of the treatment , brought up , and the vaccine &apos;s vaccine in connection .
very frightening .
so , thousands of studies were done to see if that was true .
so , there &apos;s a lot of studies that we should do ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came out of the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t matter . it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see to see what we &apos;re seeing , what we think we &apos;re really feeling .
we don &apos;t believe in a pile of documents that are given us data , and i understand that i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of this was catastrophic .
catastrophic because of this fact : the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world where immunization vaccine goes down for rodents .
that &apos;s a little bit of a sudden , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happens is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because here &apos;s an ace of anesthesia .
has one in the audience ever ever seen anyone in rodents ?
not very often .
in this country , not in this country , they &apos;re actually not in the world , but they &apos;ve dug up in the last year .
these are many deaths through starving , 20 per hour .
but because this is not happening here , we can do it in denial , and people like jenny can walk around and dig messages from fear and illiteracy king and larry king live .
and you can do that because you can &apos;t connect and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be equal , but almost never the same .
and that &apos;s something we need to learn , and that &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas corbusier .
he was attacking us from one of the worst most popular people in human history .
no fear , no distress , polio , tick , disappeared .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul hunter .
he &apos;s just developed a couple of other people &apos;s worth of a team .
he can save the lives of the world , 500,000 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
well , that &apos;s good , except that paul runs and talking about vaccines , and they say how valuable they are , and that people should just stop complaining .
and that &apos;s what he says .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul talks in a public state , he can &apos;t tell no armed guards .
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him that they know where their children go to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
you go back , go back the diseases , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s just happening .
we have now to starve to this country .
and that &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just dying of rodents .
what about polio ? take this . why not ?
a couple of weeks ago i wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i said , i &apos;m a little bit sharp .
nobody ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against polio . no one .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
we had no polio in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe this morning , someone in lagos , in a plane , flies in a plane , and it &apos;s just going to los angeles , right now , he &apos;s about ohio .
and he goes in a few hours , and he &apos;s a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to go to one of these most profound days of this .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a treadmill &apos;s disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because the world works now .
that &apos;s the planet that we live on . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love to cover ourselves in lying . we love that .
did you take all your vitamins tomorrow ?
so , a little bit of a plastic , a little bit of a plastic , which helps you to get it down .
i know that they did that because half the americans do it every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference as often we find that they are useless .
the data is constantly showing that .
they make their urine . they never do it almost .
this is okay , you like to be 28 billion dollars for dark .
i &apos;m going to agree with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health system is seth .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing to us and the most amazing self that can afford to do it .
so we &apos;re going away from this , and where do we run ?
we &apos;re running in the poor of the world .
that &apos;s great . i love the most violent .
but you know , this is really a serious thing , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars .
and i have all kinds of little clicks here .
no one of them -- the fish , was , in fact , was , in fact , a lot of time , and i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we &apos;re going to have billions of dollars , it &apos;s been .
and you know what ? if i say that , people scream at me and say , &quot; what do you care ? let &apos;s do people , what they want . &quot;
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the health industry , which says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to adopt the evidence of my experts , &quot; or any of the people who want to treat his patients with their patients .
if you go to this path where and the magic and the magic is drawn and science , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to the south africa to south africa .
he brought 400,000 his people , because he was in the fact that red tiles , and the most effective and more effective than antiretroviral drugs are from whom we know that they can break the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths in a country that will be worse than any other of this disease is going to be more than any other .
please don &apos;t tell me that these things have no consequences .
they have them . they always have .
now , the most important epidemic that we &apos;re currently in is this e8 battle between the most developed , genetically modified food and the most violent .
this is a kind of argument . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
that &apos;s ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every single branch , every branch , every calorie , was changed by the people .
you know , there was no marketing designer in paradise .
there was no internet rights .
there was no marketing system . we did it all .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them worked and don &apos;t work .
we are rid of what doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more specifically , and of course , there are risks , but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , to extend their lives .
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re routinely pushed food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m constantly listening to is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , hormones , we don &apos;t want a huge area to do with one thing that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
and you know what my answer to all of this is ?
yes , you &apos;re right . fix it .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge , huge animal , but that &apos;s not science .
that &apos;s not to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , more friendly .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes not , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work because we &apos;re afraid of being a real dead , and it holds millions of people from the flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we will have 70 percent more food than in the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
you need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? genetically changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this , like , to eat this stuff , like &quot; name &quot; .
frederick is something that &apos;s a half a billion people eating .
it &apos;s about how a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s seth .
it has no nutrients ; it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are building all this .
and then people could eat the food and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be 63 pulleys , but it would be beautiful .
and everything i can say to this is : why do we fight that ?
i mean , we ask ourselves : why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want genes to go around ?
it &apos;s not about the genes moving around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about ridiculous passion for hormones , our turn on the greater food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do so far , we &apos;re going to do something that we &apos;re doing , not guilty of , i think , not guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of our , and we really need to stop it .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; you still want to go into this ridiculous machine and go to the future ? &quot;
anyway , that &apos;s what i want to do .
right now , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this machine machine on everything we want .
we can move them out where we want them to move , and we &apos;ll move it where we want .
we need to have these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the machine machine , we will be happy to have that .
i know that we can , and as far as it is , it &apos;s something that needs to take the world now .
thank you .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been interested in the ted lab for a while , and it seems strange that a magician is interested in it , because it &apos;s like me , as i think , as a deception , which is a real thing to be seen when someone is just looking enough to believe . &quot;
in other words , sugar pills have shown a measurable effect , which is the most essential , and that &apos;s because the person thinks what happens to her is a kind of a , or a kind of ...
a deception is going to be a real thing because someone is feeling it .
so we also want to understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that &apos;s at least since the 1950s in every single single day for children .
i learned it from the most violent of the hood of the alps in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i &apos;ll explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can study , my hand , that you can study .
i &apos;m going to just hold it in my stomach .
i &apos;m going to push my sleeve back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or out of him , i &apos;m just going to just put my wrist right here .
you can see that there &apos;s no time to do anything . as long as i &apos;m here , there &apos;s nothing in my sleeve or coming out .
and the goal is , it &apos;s just simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , the knife is held through my naked physical magnetism .
it actually sits so closely on his place that i can shake it without that the knife is enjoying .
nothing flows into my sleeve or comes out , no more , no more , and you can study everything .
the question .
now , this is a trick i often have little kids who are interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you &apos;re very closely looking at it , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably many of you know this trick in the room .
he works like this .
i think the knife in my hand is in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to make my wrist , to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or pull out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i put my wrist is that it &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
because in the moment , where i &apos;m holding my hand from you , you &apos;re going to see it from back , this finger , my valentines , just from there , where he was , in a position , where he was so extended .
great trick ?
there &apos;s somebody in the back , who doesn &apos;t have childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i got to the face of the finger , the fingers change his position .
and now you might talk about why that is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that there are only three fingers down there , because the mind and the way he actually works information is not going to count , not one , two , three , but you see them as a group .
but this is not what &apos;s going on here . and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s going to be held , but not by the magnetism of my body , but by a trick , through my valentines , that &apos;s now there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing i &apos;m going to do is , by the way , i &apos;m going to get through this movement , that the finger is going to be more restrained again .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
you can take your friends and neighbors , and thank you . thank you .
now , what about the most powerful thing about the ted revolution ?
a year ago , i read a study that really has laid me out right .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a researcher , and that &apos;s why i was an amazing thing .
because it turns out that if you offer a placebo in a kind of a white pill in a white pill , the shape of a car is just a round , white pill , which has a specific impact .
but if you give the shape , you give placebo to the , for example , in a smaller pill , and this blue color is shining and a letter that is actually measurable , it actually is measurable effective .
and that , although none of these are a little bit of plastic sugar -- it &apos;s just sugar sugar .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? really , i really freak out .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
if you take a tiny strip , you &apos;re more effective than any form of any form .
a colored capsule that &apos;s going on on a end and on the other red is better than a white capsule .
the dosage also plays a role .
a pill twice is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . sorry me .
but the key thing is ...
... that also , the doses of the dose .
and the shape is playing a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate design system , you have to reach to the needle .
right ? one syringe with a laser cap -- a few of the things that you &apos;re doing a little bit of a material , you &apos;re going to be constrained by a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in the head , and that &apos;s a lot more stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time when we have a ct scans .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill , which doesn &apos;t seem so good as a capsule that doesn &apos;t seem so good as the needle .
and none of them have really a real property , and it &apos;s just our faith that we can make a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;m taking something that obviously is a deception , and i &apos;ll just look at it .
we know that we have to get out of the study that you need to reach to the needle if you &apos;re supposed to go to the needle .
this is a very long time long long time . it &apos;s very , very disappointing . and i &apos;m going to just wrap it up a little bit of a bit .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not a particularly tactile flesh .
this is my skin . this is not a special one of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin and pull through it through the other side , and then roll back on the other side .
if you get fun -- if you fall out of it , i showed you a few friends in a hotel room , and some people who i didn &apos;t know , and a woman that i didn &apos;t know , and it &apos;s a woman &apos;s wife .
so i propose if you &apos;re fast , you &apos;ll look at the next 30 seconds , and you know , you know what , i &apos;m going to make the first sensitive part here .
you can see it right now , but you can also see it , if you want .
so , it &apos;s like this , right here , where my flesh starts on the bottom of my arm , i &apos;m just going to make a little bit of a constant .
i &apos;m really sorry . does it make you crazy ?
and now just a little bit of my skin and on the other side of the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in the same way .
about it .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four .
well , yeah .
i know what people think when they see that .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not that stupid , and the skin is just the skin , just to talk to us a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;ll show you .
what does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people in the back say , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see this right . &quot;
people in the u.s. rights are now coming in .
let me show you from the close .
this is really my skin . this is not a special one of hollywood .
that &apos;s my flesh , and i can rotate that .
sorry . if you get fun , you &apos;re looking away , don &apos;t look .
people back , or the ones that eventually look at video , they &apos;ll say , &quot; well , that &apos;s pretty impressive , but if it &apos;s real , you would see -- see , here &apos;s a hole , and it &apos;s actually going to be , you know , you would bleed . &quot;
okay , let me just give you a little blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
i would usually take the needle out .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this frame , and with the intention of making a real purpose , i &apos;m going to just leave the needle there , and go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to see a couple of times in the next days .
i hope you &apos;re happy to be happy . thank you .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i &apos;ve been taking some people the number of books that were published with happiness in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness among researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of fun .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these tide , there are several cognitive fall that are kind of impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is now going to be of these cognitive fall .
that &apos;s true of flutes that think about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists that think about happiness because it turns out that we are so mess as everybody else .
the first one is a very , very clear , complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness simply doesn &apos;t make a useful word , because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could just do it , but in the large and all the time , that &apos;s something we need to give up , and we will have to embrace the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is a reminder of experience and memory : basically it &apos;s between happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both the most violent in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the most powerful , and that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a question that affects well-being without its meaning to disprove its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive event .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now i &apos;d like to start with one example of someone who had a design company , who had a story , which was a story called , and he said he heard a symphony , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and it was absolutely wonderful music , and there was a kind of a light ring .
and then he added , really quite emotional , that has the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t .
what it had ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had been in 20 minutes of music .
they didn &apos;t go to the board because he was a reminder of a reminder ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all he received .
what &apos;s really telling us is that we could think about ourselves and about other people in the sense of two species .
there &apos;s a more powerful self that lives in the present and knows the present , the past is able to experience the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the most powerful self that the doctor &apos;s doctor -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; does it hurt if i &apos;m going to put it here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a more powerful self , and the most powerful self is that the most powerful and the story of our lives is , and it &apos;s the one that is the doctor that is asking the question : &quot; how did you feel in the last time ? &quot;
or , &quot; how was your journey after albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different units , the most powerful self , and the most powerful self , and the two to decide is part of the most powerful of the world &apos;s happiness .
now , the most popular self is a storyteller .
and this really starts with a fundamental reaction to our memories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories if we &apos;re doing it to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories that are what we need to keep our experiences to .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s an old study .
these are real patients who put themselves in painful process .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but she was painful when this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all the 60 seconds of pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who from both of them have suffered ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b has suffered more and more , and his main time , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they were suffering ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient had a much worse health care rate than the patient b.
the stories of the world &apos;s population were different , and because a very important part of the story is how it ends .
and no one of these stories is very , very much , or great -- but one of them is very clear .
but one of them is very worse than the other .
and the ones that was worse is where the pain was at the end of the end , it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people to be asked , and also much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than b in the world &apos;s office .
well , this is a direct conflict between the most violent self and the most powerful self .
from the point of view of the internet , b clearly had a worse time .
well , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s working , you could actually get the patient &apos;s most efficient by a lack of the tube by just shaking the tube in it without too much .
that &apos;s going to lead to the patient , but only a little bit less than before .
and if you have a few minutes of power , you have that the most powerful self is a bad thing , and you have that the most powerful self is a much better way to get the patient &apos;s own a much better story , because now you &apos;ve given a better story about his experience .
what &apos;s a story ?
and that &apos;s true for stories that make us memory and it &apos;s true for the stories that we invent .
so , what a story is , is a little bit of a sense of representation , and the significant moments end .
end up , very important , and in this case , the end is dominated .
now , the most popular self is alive .
it has moments of the u.s. &apos;s worth , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i did this -- you know , the psychological present as about three seconds . what means you know , in a life , you know , there are about 600,000 million of them . most of them don &apos;t leave over 600,000 . most of them don &apos;t leave .
most of you will completely ignored by the most violent self .
and yet , you get the impression that you should count that what happens during this moments of the world &apos;s life is our lives .
it &apos;s the limited resource that we use as we &apos;re on the world .
and as we would use them , it seems to be the story that &apos;s going to keep the most powerful self to us .
so we have the most powerful self and the most powerful self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is to deal with time .
from the point of view of the self , if you have a holiday and the second week is exactly as good as the first one , the average vacation is twice as well as the world &apos;s birthday vacation .
this is not how it works at all for the most violent self .
for the most violent self , a holiday holiday almost better than the most of the time , because there are no new memories added .
they don &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable , which is different from a very different self , which is a very different self , and it &apos;s very little influence on this story .
well , the most powerful self makes more than to remember and telling stories .
it &apos;s actually the way that the decisions that make decisions , because if you have a patient , we have two different surgeons in two different surgeons and decides what to choose , then the one that &apos;s going to pick the memory is that it &apos;s the one that &apos;s going to pick the memory .
the most powerful self has no voice in this election .
we &apos;re not really choosing between experiences . we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we usually don &apos;t think of our future as a car .
we think about our future as a computer model .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the internet , and you can think of the most powerful self as one that &apos;s going to be the most powerful self , not needs to have the most powerful self .
i have the impression that if we &apos;re doing a holiday , it &apos;s a lot of the case that means we &apos;re mostly doing the hospital in the service of the country .
and that &apos;s a little bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much is we from our memories ?
this is one of the reasons that &apos;s given for the dominance of the water .
and when i think about it , i think i &apos;ve made a vacation that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i had ever had , and i think relatively often in relation to how often i think about other people .
and i probably have my memories of this kind of trip , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i ever had the folder , with 600 pictures in it , i &apos;d spent another hour .
well , these are three weeks , and these are just a half hours .
there seems to be a grammar .
now , i like to be a little extreme , you know , how little appetite i have on the ted level of memories , but even if you give more of it to more than a matter of the weight , why do we give memories so much weight in the weight that we &apos;re communicating ?
so i want you to think about a thought of thinking .
imagine your next vacation , you know that at the end of the ted community , all your pictures are wiped out , and you get a drug &apos;s drug , so you &apos;re going to remember nothing .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
and if you were going to choose a different holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species and you have to think about how you choose this conflict and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think of the time of the time , you might get a different answer . and if you think of memories in the sense of memories they might be able to get a different answer .
why we choose the most powerful that we choose to take a problem to the two species of self .
now , the two types of self throw two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per person .
so you can ask : how happy is this the most powerful self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments of life in the life of the brain ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of happiness itself over time .
if you &apos;re lucky to ask yourself , it &apos;s a different thing .
this is not how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or pleased the person is when this person thinks about their life .
very different term .
every one that &apos;s not going to be different from the conclusion of happiness , and i &apos;m one of the researchers who have been rejected for the value of happiness , who has been rejected for the way that happiness has been made of the happiness .
the distinction between happiness of the internet &apos;s self and happiness has been recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re going to be able to measure the two sons .
the gallup organization has a worldwide survey , which has been asked to ask more than half a million people , which are what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started learning about the happiness of the two species .
and the main lesson that we think is , i learned , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and it really doesn &apos;t teach you a lot of how happy he lives and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation that correlation is about the information that is about a function of information .
what does that mean that if you meet somebody and you would tell you , oh , his father is a little bit of a school , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about its size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody has his life as eight in a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his favorite self .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what happiness is defined .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mostly true to people that we like to spend time with people we like .
there &apos;s other pleasure , but that &apos;s a dominant thing .
so if you &apos;re going to maximize the happiness of the two species of self , you &apos;re going to do very different things .
the conclusion of what i &apos;ve said here is we really shouldn &apos;t imagine happiness than a substitute for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very quickly , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things if we think about life and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are going to be in california , they don &apos;t get the correct answer .
if you ask that question , you think people have to be happier when they say , in ohio , we live in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and that difference is , we say , in climate .
now , it turns out that climate is not very important for the self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the visceral self , which decides how happy people are .
but , because the visceral self is responsible , you can end up at the end -- some people could go to the end of california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track what happens to people who are going to go to the hope of california , happier .
now , you &apos;re not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is , it will happen . you &apos;ll think they &apos;re happier , because if you &apos;re going to think about it , you &apos;re going to be happy to get the weather in ohio . and you &apos;re going to feel that you &apos;ve got the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i &apos;ve got to give you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question of you .
thank you .
now , when we heard a couple of weeks ago , she told me that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came out of this period of time .
is that something you can let us connect because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel paravicini : sure .
i think the most interesting result we &apos;ve found in the gallup survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
if we looked at how emotion is useful with income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very big sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample of 600,000 dollars a year of 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
so , the gene &apos;s : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year is people unhappy , and they &apos;re going to be more happy , the poorer they will .
we get a absolutely flat line .
i mean , i &apos;ve rarely seen so flat lines .
what happens is obvious that money doesn &apos;t take a waste of money , but that lack of money in money certainly gives you misery , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the other sense of the other self , the most of the time , you get a different story .
the more money you deserve the happier .
it &apos;s not true for emotions .
but danny , in all american involvement , is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people would take this kind of seriously seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on the head , everything we believe in terms of the , for example , in terms of the food and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , that the country is generally going to take a place of the country , and they would make politics based on politics ?
so , you know , i think , i think there &apos;s recognition for the role of the world &apos;s role in politics .
the recognition is slowly going to be in the united states , no question , but in the u.k. , it &apos;s happening , and in other countries , it &apos;s happening .
people are in mind , remember , to think of happiness if they think about politics .
it will take a while , and people will argue whether they want to study or whether they want to study or they want to study it , so we need to take this discussion quite soon .
how to increase happiness is very different from how they think and whether they think about the most powerful self or whether they think about the most powerful self .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you &apos;re going to be able to measure the most of the population .
this is what i think is going to be in the next one or two decades of national statistics .
now , it seems to me , this topic , or should be at least the most interesting political debate to pursue the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny ornish .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in reality , as you &apos;re in the blink of the country .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince you more people , including to give them any more time with play and more and more of the games .
we currently spend three billion hours a week with a long time of water .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a whole lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe too much time , if you think about how many problems we really have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute for the future is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours a week , not nearly enough to solve the most devastating problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increase this time dramatically .
i have calculated that the time that it took time to take a 21 billion hours per week .
it may seem very much a bit more neutral , so i can do it , so that if we &apos;re doing problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts , obesity , i believe , we need to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week .
no , i really mean it seriously .
why ? this picture is pretty accurate , why i think games are so essential for survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of the photographers phil &apos;s .
he wanted to capture the feelings of play . so he made a camera a camera .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you don &apos;t have a player , maybe you might be able to get some of the nuances in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also the very hardworking concentration , really , really difficult to solve in the solving of a real difficult problem .
if you &apos;re playing , you see some of these nuances here , which are the top of the eyes , and the mouth is a sign of optimism , the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player that stands at the edge of a called experimental device .
oh , you know that . ok . so , so we have some players here .
a silver victory is an outcome that is so very positive that they didn &apos;t know before that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and if you reach it , you &apos;re shocked to actually be able to do something like this . that &apos;s a kind of a victory victory .
this player is a short kind of a epic victory .
and this is what we need to see on millions of faces from the world , if we take the barriers of the next century in attack , and the face of those who are moving to the edge of a epic surface of a epic surface .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re looking at this face in real life when we face hard problems .
i call it the &quot; in life &quot; i &apos;m bad , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? ok ? ok ?
i &apos;m like , &quot; i &apos;m doing &quot; in life &quot; i &apos;m bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i was in my ph.d. , why we &apos;re better in play than in the real life .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good as playing in play .
and i don &apos;t just mean less , although that &apos;s heard .
we &apos;re going to get more . i mean , i mean , in relation to motivation , something more significant to do with collaboration .
if we &apos;re in a corporate , i believe that many of us are in our best version , anytime , and immediately , to solve the problem , try to solve the problem as long as necessary , and they try to try and try it back to the bottom of the road .
and in reality , if we &apos;re failing , if we &apos;re going to hit obstacles , we often feel different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or paranoid .
we never have these feelings , if we play games , there &apos;s just no way of playing in games .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible in games to think , you can &apos;t just achieve anything ?
how can we actually transmit these feelings from playing into reality ?
so i looked like the world of warcraft , which offers the ideal environment to collaborative problem-solving problem .
and i &apos;ve found some things that the epic jump will make in the way that it &apos;s possible .
so , first of all , if you get into one of these most profound , especially in world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of characters that are ready to give you a mission mission , and that &apos;s immediately .
but not only any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your current level in the game , right ?
so they do that .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t solve .
but always on the edge of their abilities , they have to be hard , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around , and you &apos;re all over there , and there &apos;s always a very important thing to do .
and there are tons of employees .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to do their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that very easy in real life that we have , that feeling that in a small amount of collaborators are ready .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , these inspiring history , why we are there and what we have to do .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve heard about &quot; level &quot; and &quot; + 1 &quot; + a power , or &quot; + 1 &quot; .
this constant feedback is not in real life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have a + + + a + + + a crazy idea , four crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in real life .
so the problem of the world &apos;s data of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying to stand at any time at the edge of a epic , that we &apos;re rather spending our whole time in these online centers .
they &apos;re just better than the reality .
and today , all the world of the world &apos;s world has spent more and more of the world &apos;s world &apos;s world .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound nasty .
but to see it in context , the first thing that we saw was the first to go to the front of the city , and we started to go to the front of the world .
so the first step of primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend with play , it &apos;s just the point when you &apos;re holding time in terms of the scale of human development , which is extraordinarily .
but also , because it turns out we use this whole time to play this whole time , actually , what we &apos;re doing as humans are able to do .
we &apos;re developing to collaborative thinking , very creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i think it &apos;s .
look at this interesting statistic that was recently published by a researcher of carnegie mellon university , the average young man of today &apos;s population in a country with big amounts of time to have a long time of oil .
so 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of reasons : two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , they &apos;re the exact exact exact exact exact exact exact exact exact exact most successful , and they &apos;re going to be at school , from the fifth school to the degree of high school .
so we have a complete kind of a whole web , and the young people , as well as learning , is to be a good player , how everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; the &quot; cat &quot; , read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success , the success of the success of the 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of the world &apos;s worth that if we spend 10,000 hours with the apathy study of a little subject to the 21st study of a little subject , we &apos;re going to be speaking to it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what &apos;s the most important thing to do in the world .
so , what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are the most powerful .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly are players doing good ? &quot;
because if we could figure out that , we would have never been there before we could have a human &apos;s potential .
so many people have been in the world at least one hour per day with a very strict day .
these are our most common . 500 million people who are extraordinary in &quot; something . &quot;
and the next decade we have , we have another billion players that are extraordinary in whatever they are .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the most sophisticated animal production developed energy , and the energy is working on the surface , rather than the most powerful , so player on the world , in particular , in india , in india , in india , can play online .
you expect a extra billion players in the next decade .
so we have 1.5 billion players in all of this .
so i started thinking , what &apos;s it about what we &apos;re doing to do this games ?
here &apos;s the four things i found . first of all , the first thing that i found .
ok , so , imagine how extreme the extreme design system .
so , the desire is to do something immediately , to master a prediction , to think of that , with believing we have an educated hope on success .
players always believe that a computer victory is possible to be able to be able to be able to do it , and that &apos;s always worth trying to try and do it .
players are not sitting around .
players are masters of social nets .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that we &apos;re seeing people that we like to do more after we played with them , even if they &apos;ve been terrified .
the reason is that it requires a lot of trust with someone playing a game .
we trust that somebody is going to have a time to have the rules that the rules are honored to have the same goal , and to keep the back of the road .
so the most important thing is that the user &apos;s turning that from ties , trust and interconnected .
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
it &apos;s fantastic . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the most violent of the brain &apos;s brain plays 22 hours a week , as a computer designer .
the reason is , if we play , we &apos;re actually happier at work , and when we relax , we &apos;re going to be doing nothing .
we know that as human beings , we &apos;re going to work hard when we do hard work .
and players are always ready to work hard if they get the right job .
and finally , epic meaning .
player love to be part of awe of awe of the great art mission .
here &apos;s a key to the right to back the right light , you know all wikipedia , the largest wiki of the world .
the second danish world world , with almost 80,000 carter is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve collected more information about world of warcraft in the internet than any other topic in any other wiki world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to one outcome . players are more powerful , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world .
and the only problem is that they believe they can change the virtual worlds , but not the real problem .
that &apos;s the problem i try to solve .
edward mandelbrot is a key .
his work is genius . he &apos;s looking at why people spend so much time , energy and money in the water .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to be able to be a witness from a virtual worlds in virtual worlds and the world . &quot;
and that &apos;s what an economist is . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not as i &apos;m ... i develop games , i &apos;m a little bit more nuanced .
so he says that actually makes sense , because players can reach more than in the real life .
you can make stronger social bonds in the real life , as in the real life , you get more feedback and reward in play as in the real life .
so , he says it &apos;s completely logical that gamers are more time in the virtual world than in the real .
i just agree , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not a military problem .
we need to start to turn the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that &apos;s going to end up 2,500 years .
there are these ancient squares , and you know , you know ?
and there was a huge deal of this fantastic thing about this fantastic .
and these were the first of the people developed in the world .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the old greek internet , you may know this story , and the story of how games were invented .
according to the most violent , games were actually invented , in the kingdom , in the kingdom of famine .
there was such a big famine that the king of the king of the king was to be a crazy idea .
people suffered . people fought .
it was a extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
so they invented , according to the , and the whole clocks , the clocks , and the vc would be a national strategy , and at a day you would play . the next day you would play .
and they would be so much in the most violent , because games are so fascinating and we &apos;re with a fiber of plastic , and they &apos;re just forgotten to have been there that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day , you would play . and the next day you would eat food .
and according to the very , they survived this famine for 18 years , and they were eating these famine , and the next one was playing .
so , i think , let &apos;s start playing today &apos;s games today .
we &apos;re putting games to get out of the real world .
we &apos;re putting games to try and avoid everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , all that is not appropriate in real life , and we get what we need from play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
this is exciting .
according to the last 18 years , the famine didn &apos;t get better , so the king decided to be a last day of the king , a last day of the day .
they shared the kingdom in two camps .
they were playing a little bit of a laser and the final thing to get to a nozzle adventure .
they were leaving , and they were looking for a new home . they just let them go back so many people , like food , and they were looking for the rest of a region where they could flourish .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but latest medical rights shows that the most popular , the one that &apos;s been used later , the same dna , the same dna , have the same dna as the old .
so scientists recently came to think that the fact that the hell of the crazy story is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global cooling , which was almost 20 years , which could explain the famine .
so this crazy story could be true .
you may have saved your people by playing in games for 18 years , and then had these kind of dna , and so much about the interconnected one , and so much about the interconnected , they learned that they have saved the entire civilization .
so , that &apos;s what we can .
we &apos;ve been playing warcraft since 1994 .
this was the first of the world &apos;s first time in the world of the world of the world &apos;s population . that was 16 years ago .
they were playing 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing warcraft for the last 16 years .
i &apos;m saying we &apos;re ready to be ready for our own personal game .
so , they sent half of their civilization to search for a new world , so i take my 21 billion of the week .
we should be able to make a decision that half of us spend a day with play a day with the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of real world in games ? &quot; and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been dedicated to my work in the past few years in the institute for the future .
we have this limitation in palo alto , it &apos;s just shaped as we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to think of the best result , and then people empower this idea to the reality of the reality .
we &apos;re going to be providing the epic receiver and we give people the possibilities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you a very short three games that i designed to try and get people to get people &apos;s journey to their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a key thing where you have to overcome a computer scanner .
the main line is , but we have enough of the power of it , so that it &apos;s going to be realistic and it actually lives without oil . so , if you &apos;re going to pop it up , you &apos;re going to tell us where it &apos;s going to be , and then you get to get to work , and then you get to get to work , and then you get to get to work , and then you get to get to work in the real time , and you &apos;ll get to the
we tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been accompanied since the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was an opportunity experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure , and you &apos;re going to get said , &quot; we &apos;re going to get oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going to do .
find out how they would survive . most of our players have been able to keep their habits in the game .
so we have a bigger game for the next to the next , higher goal than just a basic opportunity .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; shhh &quot; at the institute for the future .
now , starting to start the calculation of a laser , that people have only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global warming , &quot; of course .
the call to gamers , we have almost a &quot; eureka &quot; project , we designed almost like &quot; the &quot; a &quot; machine . &quot;
you know jerry , where you have the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; -- you have the astronauts , the scientists , the most powerful and only together , you can save the world .
but in our game , instead of only five people say , we &apos;re in the middle of the world , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security , security , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that they can read when they google &quot; the &quot; tooth &quot; .
and the last game we get on the third of march is a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the award from the world bank , the award of social design , and you end up by looking at the world &apos;s award .
we work with universities in the world of sub-saharan africa and store , to learn social lifestyles .
we have a comic book . we have level of level , and we have a level of science , sustainability , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want to invite you all , sharing this game with young people everywhere , especially in the world , in the world , which is going to benefit together , to try and imagine their own social enterprise to save the world .
i &apos;m going to go to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the world yet .
well , i hope that you agree with me that gamers are human resources that we can use in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have these all superpowers , the productivity , the ability to make the strong social nets , and the desire to make sense of the decision for the meaning of the decision .
i really hope that we &apos;re playing important games to survive on this planet , to survive another century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design these games with me and play .
if i go to the next decade , i &apos;m sure that i &apos;m going to make any difference in the future , that we can create any choice , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the test games !
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about what a few months ago i saw in writing a piece of a piece of a kit for a week .
i &apos;ve always been writing my favorite time , but i was doing the work of text , and i was finished to know that i never had in my life , which is &quot; disabled &quot; .
i read you the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; a common , helpless , helpless , destroyed , mutilated , wounded , beaten , legally , ominous , sweat , and she &apos;s blown up , she &apos;s useless , you know , useless , behold , you know , useless , behold , useless , behold , she &apos;s injured , she hurts , she hurts , useless , behold .
so , the sound of happiness : healthy , powerful . &quot;
i read this list of a friend according to a friend , and i had to laugh at it , but i just came to &quot; yum &quot; yum &quot; yum &quot; and i had no longer to read and to read and to get to the back of this kind of thing .
of course , this was a very , old old , old computer , i was thinking that the copy has been quite old .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early 1980s when i started to build the primary school and started to form my self &apos;s self , and to form the other way to make me in the other children and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god for me not to use a television program at the time .
i would take this post seriously , i would be born in a world that someone like me would perceive as a person who can be positive in any way , but today i &apos;m going to be able to do the opportunity and adventure that i &apos;ve experienced .
so i immediately rented the most popular of 2009 and expected to find out that i find a little bit of a piece of contribution .
here &apos;s the most powerful version of this kind of thing .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words , in particular , is the &quot; close &quot; and &quot; close &quot; .
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many ancient societies , including the greeks and the roman , really believed that the builders of a football system have a huge force because that , which is what you can do from the end of the day , also , by visualizing what you can do .
so , what do we actually want to negotiate -- a disabled person or a powerful person ?
just a human being in a child could be a child , could be a job , and they can browse and they can tell them ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open you up ?
a human who opened up for me , was my pediatrician at the university of the former buddhist institute in the refugee in northern africa .
he &apos;s called dr. dunlap . a name of the name , whose name , as you can think , is most americans couldn &apos;t correct it , so he &apos;s called dr. p. .
and dr. p. wore very colorful flies and was just a lot of work for kids .
i found the time i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my favorite .
i had to repeat the same thing , and i had to repeat virtually much of the heavy , elastic , elastic , different colors -- you know , to build my favorite , and i hated it more than anything else , i hated her . i hated her . i hated her . i hated her .
and imagine , i even have as a child &apos;s child with dr. p. crying and so trying to stop this practice , and i &apos;m trying to stop it without success .
and one day he had seen me at one of my work -- these were just tiring and screaming -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so much , powerful and young girls , you &apos;ll tear one of those rubber lines .
and if you create it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
that was , of course , just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that five people in the hospital were going to be in the second floor , but he actually got me to see my daily body experience with new eyes .
and i &apos;m asking myself today how much his vision of me as a strong and powerful young girl , and i could imagine that i was able to see a natural , powerful and powerful human being .
this is just an example of many , as adults in the world of a child can change the imagination of a child .
but as you can see , as you can see , the most important examples of the dna , our language doesn &apos;t make a space , imagine what we all wanted to do : to allow anyone to see themselves as a powerful human .
our language behind the social change , which was caused in many cases of a technological change .
from the medical standpoint , of course , you can tell that my legs , the most powerful for the ted community , and artificial health , for aging body , which allow people to use , really , to be able to be able to take their own identity , to make them feel a different identity , to make them feel a different identity , and to make them feel a different identity , to make them feel a different identity .
so perhaps this technology is showing more clearly because it has always been a different truth , which is that everybody &apos;s a lot of the people who can make something very well , and they can make the human capacity , our biggest plus , is our biggest plus .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s an interesting story , because people always ask me to tell you how to deal with , and i &apos;m going to be able to tell you something : this sentence has never been to me , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable about that , and i think i &apos;ve been going to understand why .
this sentence of dealing with the odds of the idea that success or happiness depends on a challenge , without being able to be able to be able to be able to get the experience of a prosthetic experience , and as if i could get the way that i could get a little bit of life , i could get a little bit of life to my disability .
but the truth is that we change . of course , we &apos;re actually shaped by the challenge , whether they &apos;re physically , emotionally or even both .
and i &apos;m saying that &apos;s good .
thirty is not obstacle that we need to have to be better , to get better with our lives .
we have experienced odds of our lives .
and i tend to find out to be more incremental than i &apos;m looking at .
sometimes i realize he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s not to see , but he &apos;s constantly at me .
and i don &apos;t want to do the impact of the impact of a human being in a human house .
there &apos;s a more satisfying way of living in life and challenges , and these are just the real ones , and every person is going to be different , but the question is not whether we &apos;re getting to the duration of the way we get to the duration of it .
so we &apos;re not only responsible for the people that we love to preserve , but they also get to get to get good to get to it .
and we don &apos;t like our kids if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to separate two things : to be the medical fact , to be the other , and the social opinion , whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and sustained disability that i had to put on , is that the world is constantly thinking , she could describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect people who are at the heart , and the cold , hard truth about their medical prediction , or even a forecast of life to ask them , we have to look at that , we &apos;re not going to put that on that someone is actually disabled .
maybe the way that it &apos;s the process is that it &apos;s just going to look at what &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we fix it , for every single disability as a living system .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being , and not all of its forces and possibilities , and we recognize , we can make sure in addition to the natural struggle that you may have to have , another disease .
we have a human being worth a value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the world &apos;s data and focus on all the area of human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between perception of our impressions and our great , and our great business technology , is a connection .
we shouldn &apos;t be able to be fluent with this challenge , or regardless of , we should not try to avoid them , but we should go to the carpet , but it &apos;s about to see the odds of the odds .
it &apos;s probably about to ask me to think that we don &apos;t necessarily have to overcome incremental , but that we &apos;re open to the hug , to put them on the track of the road , and maybe to use a more , to take a more , to take a more , to take a more , and maybe dance .
and maybe we can see it , more nuanced than something natural , coherent and useful , and feel so much of your presence as so hard .
in this year , we celebrate 200 . the birthday of charles darwin and he wrote about the last 150 years ago , darwin has written , in my eyes , in a very very particular place .
i would use it : not the most powerful of his kind of survival , and not the most powerful of his kind , but the ones that can adapt to change .
it &apos;s creativity made creativity .
not only from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability of people to survive and to survive , is to change the fight of human mind , to turn through conflicts .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of people .
and maybe we know what wood we &apos;re going to walk out when we &apos;re really paying out .
perhaps the sense of disagreement , a perception of the value of the value , a sense of our own power .
we can pay ourselves something like that .
we can give a new meaning to a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see incremental as change .
thirty thousand points are for change that we haven &apos;t adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve done is to believe that we should be normal .
so , honestly , who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual . the typical thing . but not the normal . and you would like to know that poor , gray person really really want to learn to know if it &apos;s really ?
i think that &apos;s not .
it would be great if we &apos;re the paradigm of the normal against another possibility or the strength to make it even more dangerous , and then we can release the forces of very many children , and they invite them to bring their very special and valuable skills to society .
and so , the point of life found that we have people from the members of our society , and they have a responsibility to be useful and to contribute .
there are evidence that the neanderthals have been older years ago , and people with severe physical injuries have been carrying people with severe physical injuries , and perhaps that was because the life life in the world &apos;s life was valuable .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and seen , and they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to the city where i grew up in a deep zone in the vertical zone in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was standing there a wooden tomatoes .
it was summer and i had a lot of time .
and i hear like a guy behind me says , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to move around and see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you may not remember me .
when i first saw them , i brought her out of the belly of her mother . &quot;
oh , so that .
and of course , it &apos;s got click .
this was dr. m. , a man i knew only from stories of my mother about this day because i , of course , was to my birthday two weeks late .
the doctor for the medical imaging system was in vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without a computer , and my feet had been looking at them and i just had a few toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , he had the most powerful news that he had to bring up the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never be so mobile as other kids , or you could never have an independent life , and you &apos;ve just been told me . &quot;
i found that he had been collected in my entire childhood , who had been given if i had won in a second class in the second class , whether i was on the top of the street with the skeptics , and he used to get these clips to teach his students to teach his students , and he was using the medical medical school and the medical medical school .
and he called this part of his course , the x factor , the potential of human wishes .
you can &apos;t just stress enough , as critical of this factor of life can be .
and dr. dunlap kept telling him , he said , &quot; i learned that kids , if they &apos;re not always told anything else , and even if they get a little bit of support , they can get a lot of money to do . &quot;
see , dr. dunlap changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone with it is , two different things .
and i &apos;ve changed my thinking in time when you were asked me to do my prostheses in the age of 15 , and i would have a little bit of the bones of meat and bones , and i wouldn &apos;t have a second .
i really wanted to act normal at the time .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not sure .
and that &apos;s what happens because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs and not even in this experience .
and maybe this change could happen because i &apos;ve been so many people who have opened me doors , rather than people to meet me , who was being constrained to me or a notion of a notion .
see , it really takes a human who shows you how to manifest your forces , and you &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to activate its own internal forces , the human mind is so much so much -- if you can do that , and for someone in a critical moment , they &apos;re a very good teacher .
they &apos;re bringing them to open doors .
the real meaning of the word &quot; guide &quot; is going to increase in the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means something that is produced in a matter of being able to make the potential of it .
again , what potential is we going to call it a card card ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the u.k. , a case of case was done in the u.k. , and then the united states was transformed in the wild .
they call this &quot; the &quot; shhh &quot; in the united states , we call that as &quot; the &quot; eureka . &quot;
the students are divided up to grades .
and the a student will be tested harder to pay , the better teachers are going to get out of the day .
they have given a long time to give students a long time , and they have been told to be a &quot; good job , &quot; and they said they were very smart , that they were very clever , and they really have written it .
and of course , it breaks to hear the heart that the other thing was called the most popular , they &apos;re only enough .
and it was also the three months after that .
but only those who were still in school -- except from the students who were leaving school .
so , the most important thing about this study was that teachers weren &apos;t going to be .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
they were just told that the students are the student and that they &apos;re the students with the note , and they &apos;ve taught them something , and they &apos;re treated .
the only real disability is a broken mind , which was broken , has no hope , and it doesn &apos;t have any hope to do it , and it &apos;s missing our natural , paranoid , and our innate ability of imagination .
but if we can do it , the human mind to help to hope , to hope and other people around the ground , and then we &apos;re going to be able to make our forces really positive , and then we &apos;re really afraid of our forces .
if a spirit has a mind , we can create a new reality and new organizational culture .
i want to end with a poem that was written by an persian poet called the last in the 14th century , and my friend jacques mcchrystal tells me , &quot; the god who knows only four words , &quot; and the god is the god who knows only four words , and the god is just saying , &quot; god , &quot; god , is just the god &apos;s name .
come on dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right now ?
suppose i said that through a few changes of your genes , you could have a better memory -- more precise , more accurate and faster .
or you want to be more powerful , more force , more force .
do you want to get more attractive and more friendly ?
how would it be to live longer at good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who always wished to be more creativity .
what would you like most ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would vote creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many as it &apos;s creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would they choose to be a good memory ?
some more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . the majority of the people i like to do as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a different world .
is that all the fantasy of contradiction ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a persistent topic here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the view of a doctor &apos;s point .
the great geneticists in the 20th century , the u.s. , who also was a professional in the russian orthodox church , once wrote a paper , &quot; nothing in biology does not make sense of the evolution of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who &apos;s not sensitive to the biological evolution , this would be a very good time , you take your personal health system -- i &apos;ll give you the permission -- and maybe you can take a look at kathryn polo &apos;s book , and you can &apos;t take sense of it .
but if you accept biological evolution , you think about this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for other people &apos;s worth of interest or it &apos;s on us ?
this is another view of life .
in this picture , i have a bush as a center of the branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of life of life , all the existing species of life have been successful in evolutionary terms : they survived ; it survived ; it survives .
the human part of this kind of thing , far at the end , is that we &apos;re most interested in what we &apos;re most interested in .
we are feeding from a shared ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , maybe 20 or 25 different species of hominids were in hominids .
some of them came and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about the years .
it seems to be as if we &apos;re pretty remote from the other parts of life , but actually the largest part , the fundamental mechanisms are the fundamental mechanisms of our cells .
is it clear that we can use it , and the mechanisms of a shared bacterium can produce to produce the protein of human oil , which is used to treat the drip ?
this is not like the kind of brain , this is the same protein that is chemically varied by what comes out of the pancreas .
and in the way we &apos;re talking about bacteria , you know , that every one of us in our gut is more than the cells in our gut ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , think about , if antonio damasio asks her sense of self , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s very comfortable , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re all going to give you nutrients that you could only want to do without effort .
it &apos;s really a lighter way for bacteria , with a mere algal videodisc , forced crack to the end of the shock .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as much as they are for their lives .
they help the lure of measurable nutrients , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will be going on in the future ?
are we in a way of evolutionary equilibrium in a species ?
or are we sure to become something else -- something that might be adapted to the environment ?
let &apos;s go back to the time of the big bang in the big bang 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago -- the first sign of living organisms , perhaps three to four billion years ago , and then the human species , which is the first time that we have to form the last few years .
in this huge unfinished symphony of the universe , life is only just a short way to do it , the animal kingdom , like a single ct machine , and the human life , a small blood system .
we were .
this is also the most important thing that &apos;s going to be like , and that &apos;s why i hope d , you know , it &apos;s like that .
now , when i was a college student on college , i had my first favorite experiment .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i found something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in northern societies , each cell , and all the genetic information is going to be present in both of the foods .
but at the time , as a computer scientist , things began to change .
sexual reproduction is coming into the picture .
and very important : with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome will be given to the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the most popular of death in our body is going to be going to the same moment as the sexual reproduction .
now i have to confess , if i was a computer scientist , i thought , okay , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable to the point , but with every year , it &apos;s been to my continued voice .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , which is in las vegas , his show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his ted book .
he opens the door .
he &apos;s a beautiful rubber solo , a lovely nazi .
she looks at it and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for the ted game . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization as a doctor that i was a goal of the way that the evolution of evolution -- not necessarily the characteristic of evolution , just unlike it .
i tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to hold healthy .
i wanted to rebuild the health for a disease .
i wanted to have a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about communicating the genome of the genome , adaptation and survival generation after generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they &apos;re and i developed like a computer maker to send the genetic power of the orbit to the next stage , then to drop into the ocean .
i think we would all have the mood that brought the idris all to expression when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to immortality by my work .
i want to get it to not die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily matter the biggest , the most powerful or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution is the creatures that are best aware of their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , which are the most powerful and the so-called steam , if fish were there , if fish would be there , they would have a vacuum environment to make it a huge environment for themselves .
so , what does that mean if we look back at what &apos;s happening in evolution , and how we think about the place of people in evolution , and especially like we &apos;re looking at the next phase , i would say it &apos;s a series of opportunities .
the first is that we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we have achieved a kind of balance .
and the reason for this is that it &apos;s first to us , and we managed to get a lot of genes that would have been otherwise the most powerful and removed from the population .
and secondly , we as a species , as we have our environment so much , that we &apos;ve managed to adapt to them , and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we &apos;re walking and we swing and mix and mix so much that isolation is necessary to say that isolation is necessary for evolution to do .
a second possibility is that it will be a evolution of traditional species , of course , imposed by the forces of nature .
and the argument here is that the wheels of evolution are slowly gaining the wheels , but they &apos;re circular .
and so far the isolation is when we can &apos;t redesign planets as a species , it will flourish and the change of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third opportunity , a compelling , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it a little bit of the new development -- the new development that doesn &apos;t just have , but led to us as a computer designer , and we decided to do it as a commodity .
now , how could this happen ?
how could it be possible that we do this ?
let &apos;s first look at the reality that people are making decisions about their offspring .
they &apos;re in some cultures that are choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and family are deciding .
so think of it if it &apos;s not just possible to choose your child &apos;s gender , but also to make genetic adaptations , the disease and prevent disease .
what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or reduce the risk of risk or strokes ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do it , these changes in your genes ?
if we &apos;re going to be able to be more and more , these kinds of changes will be possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost to be saturated billion dollars .
so in the next year , when 2004 was finished , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in southern africa to four months .
today you can see a sequence of three billion pairs of base of the human genome to a price of about 20,000 and in the space of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take long time until the reality will be that there will be 1,000 dollars of human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everybody .
a week ago , the national academy of engineering gave the national prize for francis arnold and the most violent , two scientists who have developed independent processes of evolution to work faster and lead to more efficient proteins in a more efficient way -- which contradiction arnold is called direct evolution .
a few years ago , the most violent thing was told the scientist to be approved to be a adult , a more inclusive , and by the manipulation of only four genes that closed cell , to become a pluripotent stem cell -- a cell in the position of being able to be able to become a pluripotent stem cell .
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that can produce the human insulin in bacteria can &apos;t only do that , but also to the immunity to the other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s a experimental study in the gang with influenza that has been grown into the cells of a solar system .
can you imagine something that comes from tobacco ?
this is all reality , and in the future , it &apos;s going to be much more possible .
so , imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your descendants ?
what if you could change the sperm and the more powerful egg or the fresh egg to give your kids a better chance to give a better chance of eating the diabetes , eliminating the diabetes , reducing the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to healthier kids ?
and then the analytical technique , the same engine of science that can allow the changes to prevent the changes , could also allow us to adopt the so-called &quot; to adopt the better memory . &quot;
why don &apos;t you have the most powerful of a ken jennings , especially if you can extend it to the next generation of the world &apos;s population ?
why not have the fast fast , which will allow you to run faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are going to be the same .
and if we &apos;re at a point where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want to be , we will be transformed by the evolution of the evolution to the team of technology .
we &apos;re going to have a process that &apos;s probably in the rule of 100,000 years , and we can compress it down to a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions that their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , must be involved .
do we use these decisions to form a society that is better , the more successful ?
or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want to have for some of us and not for others ?
will we form a society , and we &apos;re going to be able to form a society , or robust and robust and urgent ?
these are the kinds of questions that we need to face .
and the most importantly , we &apos;re ever going to be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom of the wisdom we need to make this decisions ?
in the good way , in the bad part of the evil , and as soon as you might think , these decisions are going to be us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something , a portable robot that gives you a lot of skills , or a different one that helps you stand up and go to .
we call in berkeley , these robots , we call it .
they &apos;re not more than something that they put in the morning and gives them extra strength and increase their pace and will help them for example , for example , their balance .
this is actually the true of human and machine .
but not only that -- so , so they connect and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we work on , we start talking about the american soldiers , who is wearing about 100 pounds in the average of a hundred pounds , and it &apos;s the request that they should wear more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- the most important , 30 percent of them -- chronic warming .
so we thought we would embrace this challenge and create a design system that would help with this problem .
so let me introduce you to the ted story -- or the human universal trajectory .
soldier : with the most powerful , i can wear 200 pounds of a lot of hours long .
so a flexible design allows you to come deep to the living room , and we have highly agile movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and then my strength and resilience .
we &apos;re so far with our own computer system , this device , this new kind of thing in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s take a look at the user &apos;s leaders , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who are estimated in the world in the world .
this is about a percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about a very young person with spinal cord cord , who &apos;s in the world &apos;s height -- 20s , &apos; 40s , &apos; 40s -- and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging population , their number of them multiplied .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it &apos;s about a computer , or to do other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been 500 years since i say , very successful forward .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in mobility .
now let me introduce you to the point of amanda , which is carried by amanda , which was a spinal cord cord , who suffered a spinal cord cord that had been the result that she couldn &apos;t walk over 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our transportation team .
it has sensors .
his completely , completely , completely recyclable sensors in the crutches , the signals that are attached to our back , which is attached to her back .
here are also the most powerful , the most powerful , and the most powerful thing that you &apos;re moving to your hips , and you &apos;re going to move forward in this fairly peculiar and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old , and in the refugee , as a computer designer , as a computer designer , i was a college professor .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my computer .
not long after that , a doctor in my hospital room , and he said , &quot; amanda , you can never go again . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s steel every single single single unit of hope .
so , dispersants have been doing it since i &apos;ve been able to learn to go back to go back to go back and go back to the hands , and drive the hands .
but nothing was invented , which would let me go back to this .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to make us look at and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands and we have the whole potential here to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda and all the users , but for all of them .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m boss &apos;s head of a non-profit organization called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t get poverty to the poverty , i &apos;m a child &apos;s farmer , and i &apos;m a volunteer farmer in a volunteer volunteer .
now in our city , in the volunteer community , in the volunteers , you have to be quite early at the very early stage to be able to be able to be able to get a little bit of time to get a little bit of time .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer in the prison , so i was quite good at able to get a good opportunity in the world .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to get the authorities to get the people &apos;s job and to find out what our tasks were .
when i found the most serious , he was in a very serious conversation with the most successful days of their life .
it was in the middle of the night and she stood in the pajamas and she was running barefoot under a screen in the back rain , while her house was burning in flames .
the other volunteers who had just been left before me -- call him an ollie , and he was asked to go to the house and get the dog to go to the house and save the dog of the internet .
the dog ! i was lost heart .
there was some lawyer or a lawyer who could now tell the rest of his life , the people who could tell you that he was going to save a living house to save a living house , because it was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next .
the most popular thing to do is to get me .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , you have to go into the house .
you have to go up to the fire , and you have to get this woman , and you have to get this woman . &quot;
i swear .
now , not exactly what i hoped , but i went -- the stairs up , the hallway goes along , the hallway , the real thing , the real thing that was just done with the real thing to get in the bedroom .
i know what you &apos;re thinking now , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey down , where i met my valentines and the beloved dog .
we put our value out to the outside , where , not surprisingly , it got a lot more attention than my own .
some weeks later , the most powerful one was a letter of the computer , where she was going to be in the rescue of her house .
one of the things that you have about all of the things that are more valuable : someone had a few shoes .
both in my profession at robin hood , and in my inbox as a volunteer , i was witness by generosity and kindness in the big scale , but i also see the altruism and the most of the animal .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look at this room , and people who have either had a kind of success success or on their way there , i want to offer this memory : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in a different life , until you get your first million .
if you have something to give you , you &apos;ll give it .
they &apos;re going to operate in a computer factory , in a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not everybody &apos;s going to give us an opportunity to save life of a human being , but every day we give the opportunity to change one .
so they go ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno &apos;s computer : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of the human race .
a place where the women have the most powerful , with sex , &quot; and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious thing .
and no , it &apos;s not a mess , or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their own instincts .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the jungle &apos;s headquarters .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees next living in our next living .
that means we have a shared ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , which lived about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are known for their own business .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of the human evolution in the history of human evolution .
but bonobos are showing the other side of the limb .
as chimpanzees , in the great , fear of people will run , the most powerful of the female is led to the most violent female .
they really come up with what &apos;s made , because that leads to a very strict society , which has not been seen as deadly .
but unfortunately bonobos are the least known among primates .
they live in the deep of the land , and they &apos;re just hard to get accessible to the observation .
congo is a paradox -- a country extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness -- the location of a violent debate that has been held for decades and almost so many lives of the world &apos;s first world war .
it doesn &apos;t surprise that these destruction also survive the way the bonobos are in risk .
and the decline and the decline of the water that you can &apos;t even fill a stadium with the remaining bonobos -- and even there we are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country , of violence and chaos , you can hear a more rational laugh that the trees are upset .
who are these relatives ?
we know them as &quot; love instead &quot; instead of war , because they have an undefined , also sex , with the partner , and the same conflicts and social media systems .
i don &apos;t say that , that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because life is more than the resurrection of the bonobos .
bonobos -- like humans -- love to play their lives for long .
play doesn &apos;t just mean the game .
for us and it &apos;s essential to the attachment of relationships and the care of tolerance .
we &apos;re learning trust and the rules of the game .
play increases creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about production of diversity -- diversity on interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you watch bonobos in play , the evolutionary origins of human rights , you see , you dance and rituals .
play is the most powerful , which is the one that we have .
now , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique footage from the wild .
first of all , a computer designer on the street -- and i don &apos;t think of football .
so here we see a young female and males in a corporate scanner .
look at what makes you .
that could be the evolutionary origin of , &quot; she puts him on the eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more like it , right .
yes !
so , the standard is spreading , both in bonobos and people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting because it shows the most powerful , which is what you &apos;re doing , and the testes -- and also , as the game is , it &apos;s also going to be a lot of fun .
but the game is a key game .
play is a key and it can adopt many forms of what some of you are a little quiet , and you can see some of the things that are quiet , and you might be able to discover the wonder again .
and i want to show you , this is a young female , a young female , and she plays peaceful with water .
i think that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing , sometimes , in the way we &apos;re playing , and we &apos;re going to be blowing up the limitations of our inner worlds and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that makes us research , and the unexpected wiring that we form , and the unexpected wiring that we form are the real housing of creativity .
this is just a little taste on the insights that bonobos are giving us in our past and present .
but they also have a secret for our future , a future where we need to adapt to increasing challenges , through larger creativity and environmental cooperation .
the secret is that the game of the key is to be the very key of these skills .
in other words , play is our main system .
to make us feel successful about a world , we have to play .
but will we do the best of our online business ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and people equally , life is not from teeth and claws alone .
just when it &apos;s barely appropriate , it &apos;s a game that is perhaps the game .
and so my favorite thing , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution , play together , while we &apos;re doing creativity , and they &apos;re advising the creativity of the creativity .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs in the middle of 1979 , at the same time , in exactly the same moment , every one of the time , every one of them -- ok .
so two pairs , every one of them is a baby .
now i don &apos;t want you to use a lot of time to imagine the beehives because , if you think of the whole time , the editing will not be told me .
so , imagine just a moment ago .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case , the sperm carries a y , which is going to be true to the x chromosome .
and in the other case , the sperm is wearing a x chromosome that hits the x chromosome .
both are the most prolific , both fires .
we &apos;re going to come back to these people later .
i have two hats in most of my activities .
i &apos;m going to do it with a hat , with the anatomy of anatomy .
i studied an historian , and i study how people thought of anatomy -- that human bodies , animal bodies -- like they thought of body tissue , with the body body , like they thought about body tissue .
the other hat i carried in my work is the activist , as a computer designer -- or , as i sometimes say , as a kangaroo -- from people who are patients , the patients of doctors .
in this case , i worked with people who have the most powerful , the social norms in question .
so , for example , i worked with people who are the most prolific twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with a lot of people -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often , i worked with people who are their gender , their gender , so people who have not the average male or female of the female people .
and as a general term , we can use the word of the word .
so , in many different forms of forms .
i just give you a few examples of the possible guys of the types of types of people who are not the male or female standard .
in one case , you may have someone with a computer company , and the gene &apos;s gene will take the heat , the water that we have , the most common stage , to the testes of the ocean .
and so the testicles in the field of the stadium testosterone are testosterone .
but because this individual individual people are missing the receptors to recognize testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and this is called the &quot; cancer system . &quot;
so much testosterone , but not a reaction to it .
as a consequence , the body is developing more of the typical female of the typical female .
if the kid is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s being raised as a girl .
but it &apos;s mostly to get the puberty and grow their breasts and grow their breasts , but they don &apos;t get their period , but they &apos;re not going to get to the period of that .
and they do a few tests and find out that instead of the other , they &apos;re actually carrying the testes and the uterus , in fact , and they have a y chromosome .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could think of this person for actually male , but they &apos;re not really .
women , as men , have something that is something that you call a difference .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the most prolific thing that they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re taking a little bit of hormones .
most women , like me -- i think to be a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real favorite card , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me are actually talking to the built-in .
we produce the dna and we &apos;re talking to syringes .
the consequence is that someone like me actually has a brain that was more nuanced than a woman who was born with testicles , and a computer company has a baby .
so gender is really complicated , and it &apos;s not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some ways , you can be distributed over the whole range , you can be distributed .
another example : a few years ago , i got the call of a 19 man who was born as a boy , as a boy , he had a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived with his girlfriend , and he had just found a uterus and he had a uterus .
he had a extreme form of a good kind of a darwinian machine .
he has a fiber , and in the womb , his favorite , and in the womb , his computer &apos;s worth was so active that they have a male of a male .
and as a consequence , his built-in male was back to his own , his brain was exposed to the most violent male part of the country .
and when he was born , he saw like a boy -- no one had anything .
and only as he was 19 , he got enough medical problems , and he actually , because he was inside the inside , that the doctors were found that he was in the inner female .
okay , just a quick example of a variant of the robot .
some people with the killer chromosomes , develop something that &apos;s called the most powerful , which is called the internet fiber of the internet .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties of different varieties .
the reason that children with this kind of body -- it &apos;s a little bit of time or a half twins , it &apos;s a lot of time -- from surgeons often adapted to the norm , is not because this is for their physical health of advantage .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they &apos;re often made different kinds of surgical surgeries is because they threaten our social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that a certain anatomical expression is associated with a certain identity .
so we have the concept that a woman means to have a female identity ; a black person is to be , to be supposed to be a african anatomy in terms of their own history .
so we have this awful simplistic idea .
and when we faced with a body that actually is a very different thing to us , that &apos;s a very different thing to do in terms of these kinds of things .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about post-traumatic ideas .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of post-traumatic tunneling .
now you can imagine how amazing it is when kids are born , who are two people in a body .
where i &apos;ve experienced most of the excitement , the south african devil memorial was last year , whose gender was asked by the most violent world war in berlin .
many journalists called me the question : &quot; what are you going to do , who are you going to tell us whether the brain &apos;s female or male is a male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalist that there &apos;s no time that it &apos;s not there .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not a line of us , and the female , or between male and female and female and female and female and female and female and female .
so we have a situation where , the further our science , we have to think about that , that these categories we thought were really being held for robust stereotypes , which are very simple , very simple , much more , than we &apos;ve assumed .
and that &apos;s not just about gender .
it &apos;s also related to a race , which turns out to be a lot more complicated than our primary technology has been approved .
we &apos;re in our negotiation , we &apos;ve got all kinds of different areas of space .
so , for example , we &apos;re going to go to the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we going to start with the fact that we &apos;re only different from them by a few kilograms ?
as we continue to continue our science , we &apos;re increasingly going to come into a zone of awkwardness where we need to recognize that the most primitive categories we &apos;ve probably had too simple .
we see that in all sorts of different areas of human life .
one of the areas that we see in the ted community in our culture today , in the united states today , are the struggle and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about what the body is going to be to people , so that he has a rather right way to do the kind of fetal life .
we have very difficult conversations today -- perhaps not as publicly as in medicine -- about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors had never been so hard to fight the question when someone was dead .
they &apos;d just held a feather under the nose , and if they moved , they didn &apos;t have buried them yet .
if you didn &apos;t move more , you &apos;d bury them .
but today we are in a situation where we take human vital organs and want to put them in other people .
and as a result , we &apos;re going to fight with the struggle with the really difficult question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have so simple numbers than we used to .
now , you might think that the whole thing that we &apos;re going to do is to get all of the things that you would do .
i &apos;m politically diverse , i &apos;m going to be a lot of people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit it &apos;s nervous .
to understand that these categories really are much more insecure than we thought , i think , to spread .
and it &apos;s a huge way to be disciplined to consideration the democracy .
so to tell you about this tension , i have to first mistake that i &apos;m a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were a little bit more friendly , i know they were a little bit more friendly , but they were great .
i think they were so eager and strong , and so radical , which they did , i &apos;m all going to look at the most powerful , the most powerful in the outline of the dotcom peninsula , and it &apos;s not because of music that &apos;s absolutely to forget .
it &apos;s because of what surrounds the water &apos;s .
the fathers were from my view of the original trail of the original possible constructions , which is why .
what they were doing was a very , concept concept , and they were using it through another , radically and beautiful , and 200 years for us , significant for us .
as you all remember , our fathers , our fathers , the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very valid concept of anatomy .
the masters of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of the design system .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power should have the political power , because of the kind of time that the owner was the father , for the father , and so on .
the founding fathers , and they took this idea back and they took them through a new concept of concept , and this concept said that all people were creating the old data .
they &apos;re going to be doing the field of play and decided that , ironically , the common things were the common ones , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they did this for part because they were part of a laser system in which two things were in common .
democracy grew up , but the same time grew up the science .
if you look at the history of the fathers , it &apos;s clear that many of you were interested in science , and you were interested in a concept of a world &apos;s point of view .
they went away from explanations , and they were kind of making things like a supernatural concept of power , back where the transmission of power is based on a very strict conception of the terminal .
they moved to a concept concept .
and for example , if you look at the declaration of independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and nature .
they &apos;re talking about nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , they made us a concept that was made of unnatural similarities .
and so they have really been prepared to get the future civil rights system .
they didn &apos;t think about it , but what they &apos;ve done was great .
so what happened for years ?
for example , women who were the vote who were the vote of the founding world , that is that that the fact is that fireflies are more important than the anatomical difference , and said , &quot; we should have a uterus and treatable , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . &quot;
and women are getting it successfully .
next , the successful civil rights system , where we saw people like the world , how did we see people like the nuclear rights system that was about to be , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the world &apos;s office lines of the u.s. , which say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people different color colors , which are tied up to anatomical similarities , and they &apos;re going to be successful , successful .
we see the same thing in the world &apos;s surface .
of course , the problem is that , as we start looking at all the similarities , we have to start to ask why we &apos;re staying certain points .
now , mind , i want to sustain certain believers , an undefined , in our culture .
i want to say , for example , a fish , not like a human being .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that five people should have the right to give their consent to sex or to marry .
so there are some anatomical loops that are making sense of me , and we think , keep it , keep it .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep it , and whether they &apos;re good .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that have been launched at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in 1979 at the same time , in 1979 .
so let &apos;s imagine one of them , maria , three months of training was born , so she &apos;s born at june , in 1980 , born in 1980 .
henry , on the other side , is born to the ted center , so he &apos;s born in 1980 .
only because of the fact that maria was born three months of the united states , she gets all sorts of rights in a few months ago -- to have the right sex , to choose the right thing to drink .
henry has to wait all this , not because he actually has a different biological age , just because of the birth of his birth .
we &apos;re still finding other oddities about what their rights are .
henry , because you think he &apos;s male -- although i didn &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the mit with the computer , because you think he &apos;s male , it can be a male , and he &apos;s going to be able to go back to what maria doesn &apos;t care about .
maria , but not in all states , can &apos;t perceive the same right , the henry in all states , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
henry can marry a woman , but maria can only marry a woman today in a few states .
so we have this permanent path that are permanently in many ways , and we have questionable .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is such progress in the realm of anatomy that we have to get a point to that we have to be able to be able to be a democracy that &apos;s based on anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give science to science , but at the same time it feels like the science is going to be sustained .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture is going to take a pragmatic stance : &quot; well , we need to draw somewhere , so we pull it somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people were in a very strange position .
so for example , in a point , texas decided to get married to marry a man that you don &apos;t have an y chromosome , and a woman means to marry that you have an y chromosome .
now , in practice , people are not tested on their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i told you about the most violent .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i &apos;m talking a dream . &quot;
he says we should not be people to say , &quot; your color color , &quot; but after the property of your character , &quot; judge , &quot; and it &apos;s going to be like anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you judge people because of their characters ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be able to distribute rights in terms of people , because i have to admit that i have to know a series of golden design technology that i &apos;ve probably been able to do more than some people i know .
i want to make sure i &apos;m probably familiar with some light , which is the most powerful , more intelligent and more sophisticated decisions to meet their sexual relationships than some people i know .
so how do we get the question to the properties of the character ?
it turns out it &apos;s really hard .
and part of me asks , what if the content of a personality would be something that would be in the future of the future -- could be visible by an fmri ?
do we really want to go to this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is going to be in the way to make the question of democracy .
in our efforts , we have a really good thing to do , and i think we would do well in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation for example , for example , where a man who &apos;s being sexually drawn to other men is being punished with death , because he &apos;s ready to put a team of a stick in which he will stay alive .
there are no states in this kind of thing .
i &apos;m glad to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon i talked about a few years ago , who had a few of the trips to the birth of a few years to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i was talking to him , and he asked why he did this surgeries -- it was high surgeries -- his answer was that in his country , these kids would be very bad , and that &apos;s why he had to do it .
i said , &quot; well , you know , you know , they used political policies in consideration , instead of a surgery , instead of being able to separate them ? &quot;
the united states is an incredible opportunity to allow people to be the ones they are , without the state of being able to change the state of the state .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to finish , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked very much about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibilities of how democracy could look , or looked at it if we had the mothers involved in more .
and i want to say something that is radical for a feminist , and i think that there might be different kinds of insights that are about different kinds of anatomy , when people are using a water program .
since years , because i was interested in the research of the field , i was interested in research in the field of research .
and one of the things i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and act in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from the research studies is that women , average -- not every , but in average -- tend to tend to be complex social relationships and the care of people who are vulnerable to the group of people .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation .
years ago , when i did a graduate student , one of my graduate students who knew my interest in feminism -- i looked as a feminist , so i &apos;m going to do it -- a really strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what feminism female is . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about integrating stereotypes about gender , so feminism isn &apos;t a female .
but the more i thought about his question to be so much , i thought it could give a female in the feminism .
this is what &apos;s meant to be something , in average , in the average , which is a female brain of the other , which makes us more alert to the social social relationships , and more realistically for the environmental rights .
so where the fathers were extremely reluctant to figure out how individuals were going to be protected from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we can get more mothers in this concept , we can &apos;t just think of it as a concept of the way we can protect them , but how we can worry about each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go in the future when we have democracy about anatomy -- less than thinking about anatomy , and think about the individual bodies , and think more about relationships .
so , if we try to make a more perfect connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a comic , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i have , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with paganini .
i love to find a different opportunity to find a different kind of crazy , crazy outfit , and photograph in the last time , and to photograph .
but i don &apos;t buy new .
i get all my clothes out of the second hand on the street hand and in the street of the street .
ooh , thank you .
and i &apos;m going to give you the impact of my favorite impact to the environment and also the way that my purse is .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars for common is usually a good purpose ; i look pretty unique ; and it &apos;s going to go shopping to my own personal health system .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to have my size ?
will i like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers , i feel like i &apos;ve won , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i tell you what i &apos;ve got for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does someone do with so many of the armor ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought up .
i brought seven of my underwear , and that &apos;s all .
the fact that a week is all i did in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve bet that i &apos;m all willing to take everything i wanted to wear , and i would find if i was coming to palm springs .
and since they didn &apos;t hear me as the woman who runs in the ted department in their underwear -- that means i found a few things .
and i want to show you my armor for this week .
does that sound good ?
while i do that , i &apos;ll tell you some of the lessons i believe whether you believe or not , from these everyday policy , nothing new to wear .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this the luminous tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look at great .
you can almost look great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the coat , has taken 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i was wearing all week .
monday : color is a little powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiological impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing a pants pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you get other happy people .
tuesday : adapt to all of the training .
i spent a lot of time trying to try and try and adapt to myself , and i &apos;m also going to adapt to myself .
just be who you are .
if you surrounded yourself with the right people , you &apos;re not just going to understand it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people tell me , i saw out of the phone , and i &apos;m going to recall her , or that i remember her slept .
i &apos;m smiling , and i &apos;m like , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re looking at something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think that you don &apos;t look good at something , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me that day for day .
but only when i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;ll summarize that for you .
if you think you &apos;re inside and the outside one , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to rock everything , which we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden bone designer can fit with everything .
and finally , saturday : a person , unique , personal style , is a great way to tell the world about a word without having to say a word .
it &apos;s always been proven to see me and again when in this week people were getting me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all of my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home , i will give all of this back to brooklyn .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn to do this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to emotionally use these things , because the same thing is going to be a different crazy , more powerful , recyclable outfit , which just just waited me when i love a little bit in heart and search .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all together .
i have something that i want to show you .
think of this as a computer designer , as flying out .
this is what we call in our lab , called the design design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every young in italy , with this picture in italy , but the reason i show you this is something very interesting in the last decades .
a few times ago , if you wanted to win a formula , you took her budget and put her money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , they won the race .
now , today , if you want to win a race , you actually want to do something like this -- something that &apos;s going to be in real time , a few thousand sensors that have information from the car , that information , and then use it to make decisions back and make things better while information is collected .
this would be , in the blink of a game , called a computer .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made out of two parts -- a part of a piece and a half .
what &apos;s interesting today is the most important thing that &apos;s going to happen in our lives .
our cities were equipped in the last few years , and with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to be in the free .
and as a computer in the free , you start to react to other kinds of ways , and you &apos;re being driven and driven .
if we &apos;re in cities , it &apos;s actually a big deal .
just by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s earth , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population is living there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the world &apos;s population -- to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , this is a big deal .
beyond the cities , all this sense and driving in objects are going to move a lot of the everyday life .
this is from an exhibition , paola antonelli , after moma , in the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; talk to me . &quot;
well , all of our objects , our environment , start to talk to us back .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom out there is going to be out there , a sensor and a sensor .
and that changes radically the interaction that we have people with our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , as a michelangelo shaped the moses , it &apos;s called the hammer , and he was going to put it on moses , actually , you can see a little bit of a little bit of time -- and said , &quot; aw , &quot; can you see ? &quot;
now , today , our environment starts to be the first time we &apos;re going to answer ourselves .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with the sense .
now the first project i want to introduce you to is actually one of the first of our lab .
it was born four years ago in italy .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually a new way of using the network that was used on the world -- that &apos;s a kind of a plastic -- and anonymous information from that network that are collected from the ad to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was the way that italy won the world .
some of you will remember it was in italy against france , and then the end of the day , the most popular .
and no matter , italy won on the end .
now , you see what happened on this day , just watching the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see the most powerful , the flow of the stream .
on the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline up .
early afternoon , people here and there , the phone calls , and they move .
the game begins -- silence .
france is doing a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
occasionally , people do a short call , go on toilet .
second , the normal thing is , the normal part of the normal .
first extension , second .
so , in a moment of the computer , the most of the time .
italy wins . yeah .
now , in this night , all of the time , all in the center of celebration .
they saw the big key effect .
the next day , all of the time , all of the time to meet the center and the prime minister , the prime minister .
and then all down .
you see the picture of the space of the space , which is , since the roman time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the key one at the end of the day .
now , this is just an example of how we feel the city today , in a way , and we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
even quickly , another example of feeling : here &apos;s not about people , but things that we use and consume .
now , we know all about where our things come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that a mac computer is like , like they came together .
but we just know little about where the things go .
so we actually have a few little markers in this project , and we actually have a few little markers to track the garbage during the system .
so we started with some volunteers who have been helped us to highlight a year ago in seattle , which is to tag things that they &apos;re going to be able to do -- different types of things , how you can see -- things that would throw away from it .
then we have the little chips that put small brands , put the little brands on the garbage and start tracking it .
here are the results that we &apos;re getting right now .
from seattle ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there &apos;s a lot of plastic in the system .
we can do the same things in fact , in fact , with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but this is a lot of carbon dioxide , and more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we throw away , it &apos;s not just going away , that it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we throw away every day is still still there .
and if we were going to show the people , then we can move a behavior shift .
so this is the reason that we do this project .
my colleague at mit , the most powerful , could tell you more about the feeling and the many other wonderful things you can do with perceive , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part , but i want to talk to the second part that we discussed at the beginning and that &apos;s the most powerful of our environment .
and the first project is something we &apos;ve done a few years ago in southern kenya , spain .
it started with a question of the wounded community , which came to us and said that spain and the most powerful tradition , in public places , are using water as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you connect technology to connect new technology ?
and one of the ideas that were measured in a computer &apos;s program was , imagine these tubes , and valves , the valves , work , and you can close and close .
they &apos;re making the same thing as a car game with water .
if these twin pairs fall fall down , they can write the pattern , they can write patterns , images , text .
and you can get to him , and he will open up to make it open , like you can see on this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor to the mayor .
it &apos;s really like it .
and we got the assignment to design a building in the thames of the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was made of water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open and leave it in .
the roof was covered with water also .
and if it &apos;s 1,600 , if you want to reduce the lesion , you can even get the roof down .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture is going to be like in this case , you know , this day , if you &apos;re going to get the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve destroyed the building . &quot;
no , they didn &apos;t beat the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
here you see the building works .
you see the person who &apos;s going to be wondering what happens inside the inner .
and here you see me when i tried to test the sensors that opened water , not to become wet .
now , i should tell you what happened at night when all the sensors stopped .
but actually , it was a greater even greater fun .
all the kids from the street came to the building , because the way they played with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to be a , but a building that still had breaks and the holes that had still breaks and the holes have to jump out of the water .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people are using things that we &apos;re designing .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beautiful thing to create things that are used and interact with people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical design , the most powerful of water and the projections .
and this is what we got to think about this project , which i &apos;m showing you now .
imagine that this kind of thing could really start to fly .
imagine , you could have little helicopter that flies through the air , and every one of you with a little bit of light with light light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the one you saw before , moving to other people &apos;s , completely in each other .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or irregular but irregular in three dimensions that change what changes the light is not the position of the brain .
they can play with different kinds of different ways .
imagine the screen just in different ways , or sizes , in different ways , in different ways .
but then the whole thing could be a 3d cloud from a plastic cloud that you can get to the way you can get through and move through that , which you can look at many , many directions .
here you see a real video show that &apos;s a little bit of a laser , to form the most of the time .
if you turn the light , it looks like this . so , as we saw before .
imagine that every single one of people is being run .
it could have any single impulse to a pulse that comes from people , from the movements of people or something .
i want to show you a little bit of this .
we worked with the most powerful , and we &apos;ve worked with a very best ballet dancer of our time -- the most of the time in the metropolitan theater in new york and the scale in milan -- we took his movements into 3d to use it as an impulse for the carbon complex .
here you can see the dance .
on the left , you see the most different , the different sensations .
it &apos;s a very crude and a half .
so that you can feel all the movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , once we all have the most violent , you can play with it and play with color and play .
we want to use this as a possible impulse for the most complex .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
so , again , the idea is , imagine that we put the people together to do something and change the environment -- almost like we call it , design design , like you &apos;re calling it , but with a cloud .
imagine that every one can give a little donation for a long-term problem .
i think that the remarkable one of the years is that the last few years is that we &apos;re changing from a physical world to a digital world .
it &apos;s got digitized all , knowledge , and it &apos;s accessible by the internet .
today , we can do this first time -- and the obama campaign has shown this -- we can move from the digital world , from the environmental forces to the physical world .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
that &apos;s what &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow it can be to make us the challenges -- think of climate change , or co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world to physical world ?
so the idea is that we actually put people together in which they &apos;re doing things together , collectively .
the cloud is again a cloud from a cloud of plastic , which is the same way a cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud of plastic .
it &apos;s a physical scenario in london , but with a lot of time covered .
you can move and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually see it from the bottom , the most important moments of washington 2012 and other parts of the way to use the community to use .
so both the physical cloud in heaven and something that you can go to the top of the sun , like london &apos;s new clinton .
you can go to .
and a kind of digital v at night -- but as a computer designer , a new kind of experience for all of you who want to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important .
i &apos;m trying to express that , i &apos;m trying to express people &apos;s nature , and that everything is connected to each other .
the first time i was in antarctica almost 10 years ago in antarctica where i saw my first icebergs .
i was doing awe .
my heart sank , i was a little bit of time , while i was trying to grab what was before me .
the icebergs around me almost 60 feet from the water , and i could only wonder that this was a snowflake on a different snowflake , year after year .
icebergs are born as a calf , or by a glacier , by breaking out of the wooden .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they interact with clear ways of their environment and their experiences .
some people are giving up and they &apos;re injecting up to bitter end , while others don &apos;t have more and more of their passion , and more of their passion in a fit of passion .
if you look at a iceberg , you might be able to be isolated , separated and alone , just like we &apos;re seeing people often .
but the truth is far away from it .
as a iceberg , i cut up his carbon phone , i &apos;m going to put it on the atmosphere .
as the iceberg expands , he picks up water , which is a lot of life feeds .
i &apos;m going to go to my footage of this icebergs as if i do portraits of my ancestors , in consciousness that they exist in these individual moments of the way that they are in these moments , and never exist again .
it &apos;s not death if you melt ; it &apos;s not an end , but a very , very , very , very clear one of your own life cycle .
part of the ice in the ice industry that i &apos;m very young is very young -- some thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is a iceberg that i have in the blink of greenland in greenland .
very rarely is actually a witness to a single iceberg .
here you see it .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg , and where it &apos;s on the ground .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man &apos;s there .
this is the average size of a football system .
it covers about 120 feet from the water , or 40 feet .
and this video is real time .
and just like this , you show the iceberg a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really completely blessed by working on some amazing projects .
but at the coolest , what i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy .
his name is a little bit of a sudden .
and the world &apos;s favorite graffiti was one of the leading graffiti of the 1980s .
then one day he came back from walking back and said , &quot; dad , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the act .
now , the whole thing is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i stood up to him .
so i have a company that makes design and animations , so that &apos;s inevitably a complex part of what we admire in the art world and watch .
so we decided , tony -- and he &apos;s going to support -- and he &apos;s going to support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with this ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
i just want to talk to him again , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , isn &apos;t that -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t all communicate by this devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you heard about higher food and a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
normal people are not available these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , how do you communicate ? &quot;
did anybody see the film &apos; butterfly and the &quot; butterfly hall ? &quot;
so they communicate -- they &apos;re walking along the line .
i was amazed : &quot; very , very utilitarian , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came to the need , just one check , and i put a check , and i put a check from which i didn &apos;t have the smallest idea of how i was going to cash him .
i &apos;m convinced to be a place , and i &apos;m on the ground to his brother and his father -- &quot; well , my suggestion is like tony &apos;s going to be , we &apos;ll get it to him , and we &apos;ll find a way to get it back to his art .
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s going to carry all this in it , not not communicating . &quot;
so i talked to a few months later .
i met these people from the u.s. university , graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to put light on every surface , and then draw with a light on the surface that just corresponds to the negative surface .
so they pull around and they make a lot of things like this .
they say all things are going to be shown up there , a life cycle .
it starts with the khmer wine , then the most popular , then the most popular , and finally , people do art .
but there was always a life cycle in your presentation .
so i went home , and i ate my wife and i was told to her , and we thought , &quot; well , if it &apos;s this technology you can use to control your eyes , you should be able to control a laser , so that it can make a sense of that it could be a laser , that it could be mixed up . &quot;
this was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of work , and we have done some things .
first , we have the insurance insurance doors , and actually have a device for the user , and actually you get a device that is going to communicate -- a stephen scientist .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him a little bit , because you talk to him , or get an email , and thinks , &quot; i &apos;m so eager to do this guy . &quot;
and also , we have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the corners of the world -- to us .
my wife , my children and i moved into the garage , and these hackers and programmers and creators and the bees have taken our house .
many of our friends thought that we were beautiful to do that and that we were all the images of the walls , and we would be the whole images of the walls .
but for about two weeks , we &apos;ve been programmed , we went to the village of venice , my children were involved , and we were also involved in this .
it &apos;s called the kind of thing that &apos;s called the theme of the game .
this is a cheap degeneration that we bought on the surface of venice , something that we have , a little bit more , and some things from the local hardware and the water system .
we took a team of wood , they have a light set , they put them on a light hole , and now we have a device that is free to open up -- you can build it yourself , we can make the code free to download software for free .
so we created a device that is completely free from limitations .
no insurance can be able to be more .
not a hospital .
every paralyzed can actually communicate with his eyes alone or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to the back room .
i love this picture because it &apos;s the room of somebody else and that &apos;s his room .
now , there &apos;s all of these online non-visual non-visual tales of the great unveiling .
and after a year of planning , two weeks of planning , the two weeks of engineering , and the next day , tony &apos;s next time , drew tony to the first time .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and it looks about his life support .
we have a little torosaurus , so we can see out of it .
we put a ct coordinates on a wall of the hospital , the hospital .
and he was designing again for the first time in his family and friends -- and you can just imagine what was a sense of a lot of the sense on a parking lot .
so , in fact , we had to be able to do a lot of light in the parking room , so we felt so much of the world &apos;s population .
at the end , he sent us an email with the content , &quot; for the first time , i &apos;ve been drawing something .
i &apos;ve been feeling that i was running underwater , and finally , someone pulled down and raised my head , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that overwhelming ?
this is something like our primary design .
that keeps us to the landing and we keep going to keep doing it .
and we have to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a very amazing device .
and someone who has such an artistic potential is so much more .
so we &apos;re in finding out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
we &apos;ve all been given the kinds of recognition for this time .
we won a few awards .
think , it &apos;s free , no one &apos;s made of us .
it comes all from our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong merchant &apos;s talk about us and then , december , the most honored , has been honored to be honored to do the 50 best invention in 2010 .
and the main thing is -- and that includes the whole circle -- that it &apos;s that april , that this april , in the middle of los angeles , will give a show called &quot; style of the world &apos;s population . &quot;
and there are probably the hardest representative of the world &apos;s most profound representative of the world -- -- the most powerful , recyclable , recyclable -- all these guys are going to be there .
so , the show is part of the show , which is pretty tiny .
so basically , i &apos;m like , if you see something that &apos;s impossible , you can do it .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the microphone -- everything was impossible .
do it possible -- you all here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never done anything with a little bit of time , but i just got a little bit of a little bit out of the way , and i just put something out of the amazing people , so we could put something on the legs .
and that question should be , everybody , and every single day , to you , is to think about something that needs to be done , and if not now , when not , when ? and if not i , who then ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and i &apos;m probably an american most inclusive thing .
and i always say that i don &apos;t want to get a scientist like a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody ever elected farmers .
today i want to tell you about circles and revelations .
well , a tedtalk is usually something that you find because you &apos;ve left it somewhere .
you &apos;re about the block and it &apos;s been a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard hunter .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you today .
my circle began in the &apos; 60s at high school in the &apos; 60s , ohio , where i was the most popular .
i was the one who was beaten in the head of green green and blue , until a teacher saved my life .
she saved my life by using the toilet in the prison room .
that &apos;s what she did .
she did it for three years .
and i had to get away from the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it was to me to san francisco , and i found a lover -- and then i found it in the &apos; 80s , and i found it in the &apos; 80s .
about three or four years ago , i got a call in the middle of the night , a woman &apos;s call , who said , &quot; i have to see them .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never learned each other than adults have ever learned .
please go to ohio , and please come to ohio , and you can get it together with the man i know you &apos;ve found .
and i should mention that i have a little bit of time , and i want you to be a little bit of time . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we saw them , we laughed , we laughed , and we knew they had to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we took them , and we went to them , and we gave them to their family , because it was necessary .
it was something that we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults , they had to know me , turned out to be a box full of ashes and turned into my hands .
what happened was that the circle was closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation of that i showed was .
the revelation is , death is part of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life takes everything the rest of life needs .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is so often mentioned today .
he needs the same -- he needs to , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to give us these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , as you move on 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a motor that is binary , rapid , spontaneous , spontaneous , spontaneous , spontaneous , spontaneous power .
that sounds scary .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i sat on the street .
i was the only one who was able to talk to the most successful .
so i saw her right , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had been turned out , and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot made the machine after the hudson river .
that &apos;s not the route .
it switches down the lens .
imagine a little bit of a plane airplane .
and then he said three words -- the most popular words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; the driver &apos;s hit . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the most of the time .
i could see it in her eyes , and i was inappropriate , life was too end .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that it &apos;s all different .
we have this kind of dna , we have these things that we want to do in life and i thought to all the people i wanted to drive a hand and not did , all the fences i wanted to make , all the data i wanted to do and never made .
while i was thinking about it , a saying that was a saying , &quot; i collect bad wines . &quot;
because if the wine is as far and the person is there , i open it up .
i never want to move something more to life .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was , when we were the george washington bridge bridge , so pretty much about an archeologist -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing i really really really really do .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , with my mistakes , i got to get better to become better in everything i &apos;m going to do .
but i &apos;ve also given my ego room to my own own .
and i was doing the time that i wasted things for the most violent things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and after that , i thought , i decided to be a negative energy from my life to nerds .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t plan to argue two years with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have , right , i &apos;m going to be happy to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and that &apos;s when the internal clock rose , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , &quot; &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; -- &quot; ...
you can see the water .
i said , &quot; please go flying into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want that thing to break in 20 parts , like you know it from a documentary .
as we have a separate , i had this feeling of dying , to die , not terrifying .
almost as if we were going to prepare for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness really is in a thought that i really wanted to ask myself .
i wish i could grow my kids .
about a month after that , i went to a performance of my daughter -- i was not going to take a lot of artistic talent ...
... not yet .
and i &apos;m going to get a little kid , i &apos;m crying like a kid .
and in the world , everything was made for me .
i realized that at the time , i was going to be able to share the dots in life that it &apos;s really about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else , is my only goal to be a good father .
i was not going to die of the miracle that day .
i got another gift , which is to see the future , and to live and live .
my call to all of that today is : do you imagine , the same thing happens on your flight -- don &apos;t -- but do you imagine , and how would you change ?
what would you do , which you put in , because you think you &apos;d be there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parents that you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the stuxnet is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for nuclear weapons is the most important thing in the world .
the gray boxes that you see here are the most powerful .
now , if we can do that , the systems , which control and control the valves and the valves , we can actually make a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with the surface of the world ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we do it , a effective state of an effective body is used by a computer company that &apos;s used by a very high school system to get this gray box , then we &apos;re in the business .
and that &apos;s the planning strategy behind the .
so we start with a computer company .
the most prolific , the way they &apos;re going through the gray box , will make the centrifuge and the iranian , in 2100 , in the mission of the mission .
that &apos;s a little bit of the light , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started to eradicate our research six months ago , we were completely unknown what the sense of this was and purpose was .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated what the most powerful part of the brain , the most powerful part , he made by the various plastic practices , use it .
and it seemed something called a little bit more nuanced , with these gray boxes , this kind of thing .
and this is what we &apos;ve been looking at , and we started a project called a project , which we were interacting with , and we were looking at this building , and we were looking at this .
and then something weird happened .
and modernization was a very important way of thinking about the cheese , which is not what we liked -- but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we had been experimenting with different kinds of cheese , i went to that this is a more dramatic attack .
so , completely on a particular goal .
the most prolific walk out of the gray box is based on the gray box , which is a special configuration , even if the special program , which is trying to infect it .
and if not , then it doesn &apos;t do anything .
so , that really did my interest and we started working on it , almost about the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , an american american power station , or a corporate country in germany .
so we should be able to figure out what the goal is .
so , and we have the most powerful code , and we found that it &apos;s in two digital warheads , and it &apos;s a smaller and a larger one .
and we also realized that they were very professional , from people who were obviously all the information that had all the information available to the information .
they knew any bits and they had to attack them .
you even knew the most violent of the internet &apos;s disease .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve seen that the most powerful of bertrand complex and high-tech is , let me tell you , the most important thing is , the most powerful thing is to be a science .
it &apos;s much more difficult than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this kind of code code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
it looks like old-fashioned design technology .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart in this code .
so after what we were looking for first , they were highly fond of the world &apos;s , because we know what they do .
and then we went to search and went to the street and tried to get these with the real world in connection -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could record or prove .
to make these theories , we call ourselves a reminder that it &apos;s definitely about the most sophisticated , and it &apos;s got to be a quality of the world , and it &apos;s probably a high goal , because most of the infections were reported .
now , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
it &apos;s basically running out on the ground nuclear power and on the surface of the desert .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; take me a list of all experts for recklessness and power plants from our client . &quot;
and i called them , and i was going to know her to compare her to the expertise , which we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital to the top of the world with the skin .
the rotor is this moving part within the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you actually manipulated the speed of this kind of thing , you actually can actually crack the rotor and then actually blow it up , and then actually blow the centrifuge .
what we also found is that the goal of the attack was to actually make it slow and something , and it &apos;s very unusual to let the test of the test , so that they wouldn &apos;t be able to get it down quickly .
the big digital technology system -- we got a glimpse of that , by looking at it , and we looked at it very precisely .
so for example , the number of tosses is going to come out of this code , you can &apos;t miss it .
i started to get scientific literature to the scientific literature , how this alarm is built in the wild , and found that they &apos;re a viable bias in so-called the so-called , and every single unit of anemia contains a little bit of time .
so that made sense , it fit together .
and it was better .
this alarm in iran are divided in 15 days called the levels .
and guess what we &apos;ve found in the most violent ?
a almost identical structure .
so again , that really fit together .
and we gave that great confidence for that that we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go .
these results were done by several weeks of work .
and often we were running in a dead and we had to collect new .
anyway , we found that both digital warheads in fact are actually in a and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little plastic system takes a place , and the gothic and the gothic and the big , and the big news engine is going to be in interaction with six meters of interaction and manipulated to the valves .
so , in the big and all we are very confident that we actually have what the goal is .
it &apos;s a little bit of a time , it &apos;s just a little bit more nuanced .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be met by stuxnet .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we &apos;ve discovered -- really , really , out of the socks .
there &apos;s the gray box down there , and the top is the alarm .
now , what this thing is doing is that it &apos;s saturated by the output of sensors -- so for example , for example , from the computer and the internet , and it &apos;s providing a free code to do that , which is still in the attack with false forces , run .
and in fact , this false data is taken by bertrand before .
so it &apos;s just like in the car car , where the car maintenance workers are fed up with the car transplant before .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the idea of this is obviously not just proving the control of the control control .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more aggressive .
the idea is to cheat a digital design system .
we need digital engineering systems where a human race can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so for example , in a power station , if the big design system becomes too fast , you have to open up in milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human race .
so , in this place , we need digital design technology .
and if the risk of risk is , then really bad things can happen .
the power station can explode .
and neither the most popular , nor the most popular , will notice .
that &apos;s scary .
but it gets worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is a little bit of time .
he &apos;s not particularly doing anything with complacency , with the video of the brain .
so he would work for example , in a power station , or in a power station .
it &apos;s a little bit of a wire .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the rabbit -- you have to have the most powerful stick of the stick , like we saw it in copepods .
you could also use ordinary technology technology to spread .
you just have to get it up as far as possible .
and if you do that , you get a mass weapon of mass destruction .
that &apos;s the consequence we need to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the most profound environments .
we have to ask the consequences and we start getting better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was very much written by people that people think the most powerful the most powerful one is the most popular thing behind .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know ?
yeah . okay .
i think the most powerful thing is involved , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the gravitational superpower .
there &apos;s only one and this is the united states -- fortunately , fortunately , happiness .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for a maker to be a maker . thank you ralph .
i spent the last few years to place in situations that normally are very difficult and somehow dangerous .
i went to jail -- difficult .
i worked in a training project -- dangerous .
i filmed in a comic book -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days to eat anything like this -- fun at the beginning , a little bit hard in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
i actually have the biggest part of my career , and i thought that &apos;s terrible in my career , and that &apos;s just to study social social and interesting , and hopefully , hopefully , a kind of understandable , and hopefully a kind of understandable thing that makes you more fun and more accessible to the audience .
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world of the world &apos;s world , and i knew i was going to do something a little bit more .
some of you may have heard that i took a display in ebay a few weeks ago .
i sent up some of the pieces of plastic , some of the things that i gave people , and i gave people the opportunity to go to my tedtalk 2011 .
and really , some happy people and companies , the most happy and more powerful , they got the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson never will let the story go again -- the most powerful thing that they &apos;re seeing was not a title of the talk that was not going to be a title .
so what you got was this : her name is presented , my tedtalk , from which you have no idea what it &apos;s going to be about , and the one that you could ever fly to the ears , especially if i &apos;ve been stupid for your involvement .
but again , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a whole lot .
this is just the most important thing .
so despite that warning , i knew that anybody would buy the most powerful .
if you had asked me this year , i wouldn &apos;t be able to tell you this , to be aware of it .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
i said , i &apos;ve been going to go in some pretty terrible situations , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could be made , nothing so hard , and so dangerous as with these guys in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is a film around the world , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by the whole film , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; -- that it &apos;s going to be , from the top to the end , to the end , to the end , to the end , and the very first thing that you &apos;re going to see is the brand , the brand is the brand that you &apos;re going to see .
now this brand , the most powerful stadium , the most powerful center .
these people are being connected to the movie in the workplace -- forever .
and so the film is going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in the workplace , for forever ?
i &apos;m a person &apos;s person .
that was more to the winner .
it was &quot; in the cry , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to be the brand x than we have , but we &apos;re going to be sure that we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the movie .
so we might sell a shoe and it will be the greatest shoe that you &apos;ve ever carried ...
the greatest car that you ever have to have , from &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the most powerful drink of the world , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , a attention of &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; of the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; of the u.s. . &quot;
so the idea is , apart from that , that brands are part of life , actually , to bring it to the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of unhappiness .
so this is the whole concept , all the film , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy if i would help , that &apos;s going to be done .
you know , it &apos;s funny because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how to be people &apos;s people .
have you a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use arguments , because that &apos;s a negative , but you know how to develop ?
how much money will it require to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to make them , but i think it &apos;s worth it , some really famous brands .
who knows if the movie comes out , we might see a tribe of a tribe .
what do you think the answer is ?
the answer is probably , &quot; no , &quot; no .
but is it a difficult thing to do because of the film or a difficult thing for me ?
jk : both .
so , don &apos;t mean that as optimistic .
so , my lord , you can help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands .
yes .
if you look at people who you have to do with it ...
there are some places that we can turn on .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; do you ask the camera from &quot; would you want to be a more responsible thing ? &quot;
it turns out it was actually , &quot; we want to do nothing with your film . &quot;
and just that , all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
not wanting to do something with the film .
i was amazed .
they wanted to do nothing with the project .
and i was confused because i thought , the whole concept of advertising was so many people as many people as possible to present it as many people as possible .
especially in the world today , on this interface of new and old media and fragmented media media -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new exciting , exciting thing that mass causes that mass is bringing .
no , that was what i thought was .
but look , the problem was that my idea was a little bit of a mistake , and that was .
actually no , it wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
that would have been no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but that &apos;s what this picture is , is a problem .
see , if you &apos;re transparency in the field of the field , this is one of the first images that seems to be .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and balances , just to discover and separated ; it &apos;s reassuring by expression , and it &apos;s very , very clear , to the information , especially what &apos;s the most important thing to do .
you know , we &apos;re listening to a whole lot of transparency .
our politicians tell it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but if it &apos;s going to be done , it &apos;s supposed to change something .
but why ? well , transparency is scary -- like this strange bear , which still goes on .
it &apos;s a little bit of a -- like this strange highway .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is more risky ?
a whole dish cool , very cool food .
that &apos;s very risky .
so when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid , and my father caught me in the lie -- and he &apos;s sitting and he &apos;s looking at me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions of the story .
there are your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there &apos;s only one company , a agency , ready to help us -- and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve been on john bond and richard &apos;s and a half years -- i found that i had to do it alone , and i had to go directly with my team to the companies .
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start to talk to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , a broad problem is .
i have friends , the great , giant , giant , and i have friends that are little , little plastic , like i do .
and my friends , the great , giant , giant , says that the reason why their movies are so successful is that they are the most successful , the most powerful they have .
and then my friends say , &quot; well , the little little little little bit , &quot; what do we do with these big gigantic giants ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot;
so how exactly are we going to pass into the movie ?
whenever i make myself on the way , and whenever i open the web , you &apos;ll see you &apos;re going to see a lot of time .
and every time i get somebody who i can say , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
they &apos;re so far ? you can see a little nervous .
i want to help you calm up .
so maybe you should be a little bit of the interview before the interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great things .
either &quot; nuclear fusion &quot; or a &quot; paradise &quot; , they &apos;re going to have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be equipped for men and for women , and they &apos;re determined to do a stick , whatever .
this is the most powerful .
now i can answer all of your questions and give you a little bit of a protein version .
we &apos;re a smaller token .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand a brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so , you know , you know , you know , people remember careful -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in it .
what words would you pick up with ?
so careful is a lot of time .
this is a great question .
i &apos;m sorry .
technology is not the way to describe something that someone who &apos;s doing under the executed .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that this category really makes a positive , unlike &quot; fight smell and moisture . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we hold it up to the fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three feet , three feet .
these things have a more positive effect .
and that &apos;s a key one .
what about me ? what about the ted system ?
i have to talk to the man on the street , which is like me , i &apos;m going to be a computer scientist .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like to really feel beautiful clothes .
&apos; 80s , &apos; 80s , on the street of the day , except the most popular .
well , what &apos;s the brand of the brand ?
unique .
i think the most powerful , the style i have , is &quot; the magic glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , many of the things that are like this .
but normally , i have a design of the way , as pranav , or a jewelry , and so a stuff .
if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes-benz .
the brand i &apos;m , i would say , is , i &apos;m going to say , fly .
part of the french , part of a life-changing , part of the part -- i don &apos;t know .
boy : i &apos;m the most talkative .
i sell the whole country around the country , around the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , distorted industry .
the 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was a little bit of a plastic .
the guy five : brand plastic &apos;s license .
does this go ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a computer scientist .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be the most sophisticated , but i &apos;m often seeing the interface of the interface , and i &apos;m looking at the interface of the art of glamour .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed a experts .
i needed someone who could go into my head , someone who could really help me understand what &apos;s called the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; .
and so i found a company called olson , in the refugee .
they have companies like the internet companies , and they helped track , to discover these kinds of things .
if you could do it for the doing , you could help me .
they brought their pictures , yes ?
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how to interact with your thoughts and feelings about yourself .
these are the people that make my worldview .
tell me about this world .
so , the world : the world ? i think the world is the world in which you live -- how people around a , the friends , the family , the way you live , the work and so .
all these things came and start from a place , and for me , and they start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s next to you is that you want to talk about .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is that to the thought and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like strange things .
tell me about why , &quot; why do you get us ? &quot;
what is the most powerful thing ? what kind of brain are they in ?
why is it important , what is the red thing ? what does the red picture represents ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about them , which is not you .
what else do you have through ?
... does not have to be afraid . what kind of rollercoaster are they ?
the question ! no , thank you .
thank you very much for patience .
yeah . okay .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to be done .
there were a lot of crazy things that went out there .
the first thing i saw was that this idea that her favorite group , two separate spots , but the side of the side has been a little bit of a sudden -- the morgan &apos;s brand is a little bit of a plastic / mouse .
the fda is very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies are going to focus on a strength , rather than both .
many companies tend to be -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- to avoid the things that they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re afraid of , these elements , and they &apos;re going to be able to actually transform them , and they &apos;re actually changing for themselves in a positive , and that &apos;s a light move .
what other brands are doing ?
the first one is a classic apple .
and you can see it here , target , measured , luminous , mini , viral water and water .
now , there are some of the brands and the brands , these things that come and go , but a more , a , a , a , a brand , a brand , a brand , a very strong thing .
a computer company , a brand , brand brand . how is your brand ?
if someone asked them to describe their favorite card , their favorite card , how would they ?
you &apos;re a little bit of a laser ? are you a little bit of your blood in your brain ?
or are they more likely to be a more nuanced ?
are you something a little quiet , a little quiet , more conservative ?
so , the things that are kind of like the rules of the rules are the ones that are the kind of light , like the most cosmopolitan , adventurous , adventurous , and the progressive , and the agile , and agile , multicultural , portable , and agile , and agile , and the high-tech , the magic , the magic , the magic , the magic .
or are they more like a car company ?
are they ignorant and more of the way that they are ?
are they established , traditionally , more satisfying , compassionate , compassionate , &quot; oprah ? &quot;
are you reliable , stable , more secure , secure , sicker , sacred , and the way the dalai lama or the dalai lama or the dalai lama ?
in the course of the movie , we had more than 500 companies , the up and the top , and the &quot; no &quot; said , &quot; because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they were not trying to do anything about this movie because they didn &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but it &apos;s going to find 17 , which were ready to get ready to get on these control , which would be doing with someone who would do business and make mistakes like me and then the things that we would not have been told to tell , stories that we don &apos;t usually have to support .
they &apos;re going to tell us the story of the design story , like we tell the story in this movie that you &apos;re using the same to be used today to be used to the brain &apos;s brain , both to make advertising and movies .
we went to sao paulo where we were banned to the world .
in the entire city , there are no magic , no poster , no candle , nothing .
and we went in school schools where companies are moving their way into poorer schools , in all america .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback or where i had the biggest success , those are where i was connected to things .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they thought the middle pole , they thought the agencies , and they said that the agencies may not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people think is that our view of the challenge is that our view of actions .
and how did it be for you ? what it was successful ?
now , since the movie the ipcc film festival had been able to look at us that .
according to the last day , the first thing was the last day , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million of these film .
it actually includes a period of two weeks of two weeks .
this is just online -- no press , no television .
the film was not going to be left .
there &apos;s no time online . no one &apos;s a television game .
it &apos;s not in other countries .
well , finally , the film has gotten a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every ad , which we talked about , their customers recommend their customers , the finger of it .
something i think is that if you &apos;re going to arrest your chance , risks , you have to be put in these risks .
i think if you stop people , you get them closer to failure .
i think that if you &apos;re trained to avoid your employees , you &apos;re prepared to get a profit to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people not to have fear of opportunity that maybe they might be more nuanced .
finally , at the time , we should be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
we should put the bear in the cage .
they welcome the fear . welcome to the risk .
each one of the big taste is that we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , it &apos;s a little bit of a honesty .
and that &apos;s what i said with honesty and transparency , my whole talk , &quot; you know , &quot; you know , &quot; you know , &quot; you know , &quot; you know , &quot; you know , i &apos;ve been welcome to transparency of my good friends , who paid $ high school for the water of ebay .
big data is turned into the world for organizations around the world .
and the word is called transparency .
thank you very much .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , what &apos;s happening with the $ $ ancient marriage ?
this is a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , sitting on the ted floor , the most powerful of the computer , the most violent -- a check in diameter , to fund my favorite year in the next year .
my name is a little bit of a sudden .
18 months ago , i did something else in google , and i &apos;m going to do something with museums and art . my favorite , the same thing that &apos;s now , i have green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of the research studies and stories that i can tell you about 17 , i think , is about 17 countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the show .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and your access to it .
i grew up in india .
i was a great education , i &apos;m not going to be -- i didn &apos;t have to -- but i had a lot of museums and this artwork .
when i went to visit and i went to visit these museums , i started learning a lot .
and while i was working for google , i tried to do this desire -- art to lead to technology .
we then set up a team , a great team , and we started this .
i &apos;m probably going to start with the demonstration , and i &apos;ll tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning .
so you &apos;re just going to get to the street .
you can look around all these museums around here .
there &apos;s the most powerful , the moma , the ted , the most powerful , the van gogh .
i actually come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get in two ways -- very simple .
and the computer , and the computer , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and you &apos;re ashamed .
you want to orient in the museum ?
open the map , and jump it with a click .
they &apos;re in there , they want to go to the end of the gang gangs .
just further . much fun .
explore .
thank you , but the best one is coming .
so i &apos;m now a front of my favorite , a riot , of pieter atwood in the met .
i see this wishbone .
if the museum has given us the picture , you click on it .
this is one of the images .
this is all the vertical .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i &apos;m going to click this way .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve been expecting to say with the so-called so-called the so-called the so-called the so-called the so-called the so-called the so-called .
for example , this picture has about 10 billion of the brain , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion more ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you this .
you can easily get in and you can get it in .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is encrypted .
but then you really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there &apos;s something happening there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and i noticed slowly that these kids actually beat something .
i was doing a little bit , talking to some familiar people at met , and actually , it turns out that it &apos;s a game called the &quot; adorable , &quot; which is a goose hit with a stick on the wheel .
it seems quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really go close to the very first , you can go to the very first .
just to give you the idea of giving me out of the way , i &apos;m looking at what you get .
here we were , and this is the painting .
the best is , in a second .
let &apos;s jump fast to moma , again in new york .
another thing of mine , i think , is a lot of fun .
and in the previous example , it was about finding details , right ?
but what if you want to break the brush ?
and what if you want to see van gogh that masterpiece to this masterpiece ?
you &apos;re going to go in . you can really go into it .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my favorite classes , until i really am at the very very troubled .
this is a little bit of a sudden , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there &apos;s a lot of other , but i &apos;m missing the time .
this is the really cool part , it &apos;s called collections .
each of you , every -- the same , whether you have rich or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go online and create your own museum -- you can put your own collection into your own collection .
just , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of the internet -- you can get a little bit more friendly .
this is the most powerful , in the most violent .
you can put all of them with crap , send your friends , and so a conversation that you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think finally , the main thing is that all the wonderful things are not coming from google .
they &apos;re not even coming out of the museums .
i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was a experience in humility for me .
i mean , i &apos;m going to be just hoping to be in this digital medium of art , and they &apos;re very hardworking online .
and the biggest question that i &apos;m asked is , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a football system ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it should have a different experience .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can split in two camps .
this is the left half that is the logical side and then the right half that is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the most of each hemisphere , we could be able to represent their brain .
for example , this guy , that is completely logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you do your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have been to one of these extremes , but i think that for most people in the audience , their brain looks like this -- with a high high school , the same in both of the quarters .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both exclusive or something .
you can be logical and intuitively .
and so i see as one of the people , with most experimental educational practices , who need a good amount of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good intuition to actually perform the experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love playing with things .
so we go out and we &apos;re looking at it and then looking like it &apos;s responding , and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions you &apos;ve developed over the years is that a thing can be at the same time .
i mean , it can sound strange about thinking that a thing is at the same time , but it &apos;s not being born with this idea , but they &apos;re not born with this idea .
i remember seeing a child playing on a computer scanner .
he was another toddler and not very good at it , and he went all over .
but i bet that i taught him playing a very valuable lesson , which is the great things that don &apos;t just work , and that they stay on a place .
and this is a great model of the world , so long they &apos;re not a very big model of the world .
it would be a horrible model for a computer company because they don &apos;t play with the computer games , but with these little odd particles .
and if you play with your particles , you all find different kind of weird things -- like you &apos;re going straight through walls , or you can be at the same time at two different places .
and so they all wrote these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the physics of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need to describe them about the great everyday objects around us .
and that doesn &apos;t really have my intuition and maybe just because i don &apos;t often play with particles .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody ever saw a particle .
but my logical side is not liked .
because if all of the particles are made of particles and all these particles of quantum mechanics , then it shouldn &apos;t just follow all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that shouldn &apos;t be that way .
so i would better feel better with the whole thing when we could show that everyday everyday standards are also following the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i was going to do a couple of years ago , right ?
i created one .
this is the first object you can see in the computer &apos;s brain that was in the brain .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot in the middle .
this is the piece that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
here i &apos;m zooming up . we look at this in the center .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal , it &apos;s shaped as a vending machine , and it &apos;s about the edge .
so i made this thing to the similar way that you make a computer with a computer .
i went to a clean space with new zealand , and i went to the very big set of equipment for 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine -- to get this like swimming down a pool of light and get that thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the world &apos;s position , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m in the elevator , i &apos;m going to make all sorts of weird things but then go to other people and i hear all these things because i don &apos;t want to argue it , or , frankly , they &apos;re going to be honest .
so quantum mechanics says that the objects are just feeling as well .
the fellow fellow fellow institutions for the objects are not only people , but the light that appears to be on them and the wind that appears to be on top of them and the heat of the space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that piece of metal , this piece of metal is acting , we had to get out all the way out of the whole side of the world .
and we did that .
we have light off , put it in a vacuum and the whole air , and the whole air , and it &apos;s all the way to almost just , in the elevator , was the piece of metal , the piece of metal , to behave like always .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it really moves .
instead of just quiet it is just there , it &apos;s the way it was like the way it was like this -- like this -- like a little bit of a sudden , and it &apos;s a little bit like a car , and it &apos;s a little bit of a plastic surface .
we gave him a little push to put it into the same time , and we could vibrate to vibrate and not vibrate -- something just allowing in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m just telling you is what really fantastic .
what does it mean to vibrate for an object , and not to vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion of atoms from which the piece of metal is still there , and at the same time , the same atoms move on and down .
just too precise , they &apos;re consistent .
the rest of the time are they .
that means that every atom is at the same time in two different places , which means that the entire piece of metal is in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
this was worth me for all this year in the clean space , because , check that out , the most powerful between one atom and this piece of metal is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at the same time at two different places , that piece can be two different places , why not it ?
i mean , this is just what my logical side is saying .
so , imagine you &apos;d be at a couple of places in a couple of places like that ?
how would you think of consciousness that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
when we put it down , the light is going to be blowing and the box , we saw that the piece of metal always was in a piece of a piece .
and so i had to develop this new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator in fact , in fact , are just a remarkable objects that are in a small room together .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics is saying that everything is connected .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s more deeper .
it &apos;s so , these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are . and that &apos;s the deep and curious of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we should be thinking about how we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families think about where they want to live and work , they have the possibility of a different hand full of different cities that all of them are in competition to get new residents .
so we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries , which are not even available to a single city that they would welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much worth it than it costs them .
so we could just be very simple with the world , maybe hundreds of new cities in the world .
now , this may sound absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
but they just run the construction of apartments against cities .
imagine half the people who want to live in homes , they did this , but the other half still not .
they could try to extend the capacity of the existing apartments .
but you know what you &apos;re going to be doing , in these apartments , and the environment , and the laws of the rules are to avoid the rules of the road .
so it turns out to be very difficult to keep all of these big forests .
but you could go to a completely new place , build a whole new block of construction , which is the laws of this building , and not necessarily , you know , not going to be eaten .
so i proposed that governments create new areas that are going enough to offer a city to a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
i found that , later , that , about the same time , the same time , the same time , and the same time , i think , have thought about the challenge of reform .
they knew that every year of about 75,000 percent of their land , they were leaving their land to go into the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that they could stay safe , that they can stay in their country and do exactly the same in self-expression .
in this place , the point of research has said to the point of life , &quot; what happens when we &apos;re going to put a whole piece of a space in our country , if we just put it on a message of the american embassy , and the people who have to go to the ground , and then they can work on the surface of the news , and they can work on the surface of the news , what they usually do to canada or to the site of the arts . &quot;
in 2009 , synergies suffered under a severe educational review .
the next two presidential elections , the next day , would win , and the very next thing that &apos;s been used in a shift , the program , is the same innovation , and the same thing that &apos;s called the energy .
he was asking to be a little bit of his book .
in the meantime , i was preparing to talk to a talk at tedglobal .
and by improvement , and through the study of consumers , i tried to reduce this complicated concept of the charter to the rule of the simple elements of the simple elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you cannot afford existing modes of information .
we pay new technologies big attention , but for the progress of the process , it &apos;s technology and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that are coming back to us .
in the fall 2010 , a friend of guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk .
again , it showed him a little bit .
the two people called me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s present the head of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december of a hotels in miami in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are to be like a lot more valuable than it costs .
and i used this chart to show how valuable the value of a place is like new york , and think about a surface in some cases , thousands of dollars per square meter is worth thousands of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at a point when there was a pause , and he said , &quot; paul , maybe we could look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk made a very simple shape that a charter city is a place , which is the beginning of the land , a more powerful place that defines the laws that are given the laws that are required to be there , or not .
so i was asked by the president of self-expression who said that we need to do this project , that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to bring our country .
i was asked to get to the fourth and then the fourth and the fourth january , and i was going to give you a talk to the fourth and five .
so i &apos;d put a different talk to facts that have a graph like this , which is trying to prove that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it must be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch is the new airport that was built in denver .
in this airport , a 100 of the airport has a surface of 100 .
so i tried to convince the most powerful of this if you want to build a new city , you have to start at least 1,000 to a very 1,000 area .
these are more than 250 thousand acres .
polite all the time .
the audience &apos;s faces were very serious and careful .
the director of congress came to the stage , and he said , &quot; professor , i thank you , thank you for your talk , but maybe you might look at the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i came to the punch line that a new city offers the people new possibilities .
there would be the possibility in a city that would be in self-expression , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also includes new ways of leaders with one .
the leaders of government in self-expression would be dependent on the help of the aid of the world , they could benefit from their own family , which they would provide the laws of the laws and the service that they would be able to trust that the charter is really going to be shut up .
and the insight of president lobo , was that the security of the prime world i &apos;ve thought about as a way to get foreign investors could come and build this city for all parties , which are for many years of fear and mistrust .
we &apos;re in a field .
this is a picture of this place .
it seems lightly a thousand miles .
and shortly after that , the 19th of january , they voted for a change for the constitution to have a change of the constitution to have a sense of logic that &apos;s made for special plastic .
in a country that &apos;s just a massive crisis behind the congress , in the congress , in the favor of the twin community , to a voice .
all parties , all the most common of society , supported this .
so to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved by congress .
at the 17th of february , it was approved to be approved to a voice .
immediately after that election , between the 21st and the 24 february , a delegation of about 30 degrees of the world , the most interested in the world , were in the world of the world &apos;s life .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new city , which built in south korea , which is the largest largest city in south korea .
all you can see on this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the introduction .
the other place that was very interested in the urbanism was singapore .
it was built in china , and the third is in preparation .
so if you think about it , it &apos;s where we are today .
they already have a more nuanced ; they &apos;re already looking at this area for the second city .
it &apos;s been working on a legal system that allows the fact that the brain system allows us to participate and it &apos;s working on an external system .
a country already offered his top court to put in the face of the service of the system of the system of the system .
also , the most important and more interested in the world are very interested .
they even bring funding with a lot .
one thing you already know was already a lot of the people .
there are many organizations who would like to sit in america , especially in a place with free , and there are many people who would love to live there .
there are 700 million people around the world who tell you that they want to live permanent in a different place .
a million people left latin america , and they go out in the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to get their families to work to work in the work sometimes , and it &apos;s single mothers who have to make a lot of money to eat and buy clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s even children who try to find their parents , who are not seeing them , in some cases , for a decade .
so what is it for an idea about building a whole new city in self-expression ?
or even the other of these cities , or are they spreading across the world , or hundreds of them around the world ?
so what is it for a idea to get every family to a choice that has a choice in competition to be new residents ?
this is an idea that &apos;s worth spreading .
my friends were asked me to say , thank you .
you know how many decisions do you do in a typical day ?
you know how many decisions do you meet in a typical week ?
i recently did a survey with 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions that are a typical american , a typical american day , is 70 .
also , a study was done recently with ceos that they saw for a week for the ceo .
and these scientists just documented the different themes that these ceo are doing , and how much time they spent decisions that are related to the issues .
and they found that a average ceo is busy in the week with a lot of people &apos;s work .
each of these topics was of course many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were made within nine minutes or less .
only for about 12 percent of their decisions , they took a date or more of their time .
think about your own decisions .
you know how many decisions do you meet in the nine minutes of category to the one hour ?
how good do you think to solve the decisions ?
today i want to talk about one of the biggest most powerful of our modern time , the most powerful .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise , put them , just the hand , if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , please , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , so , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear something about the most powerful ?
thank you .
when i was a ph.d. professor at stanford university , i went to this very very intensive store , at least he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was called the &quot; s . &quot;
this business , it was almost like a computer cap .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and transported and transported over 500 different kinds of vegetables and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was a time when we actually drink the same .
i loved to go to this business , but at a time , i asked myself , well , how do you get that you never buy anything ?
here &apos;s the olive oil .
they had about 75 different olive oil , including that they were locked in boxes that were made of thousands of years old .
so i decided to visit one day , and i asked the ladder , &quot; does this model , that she really offer the people to all these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up to the most violent of tourists that came every day and usually had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment and we chose to be a little bit of a training experiment for our experiment .
here &apos;s her journey of the gang .
they had a different kind of user structure .
we &apos;ve set up a little bit of a little bit directly on the entrance of business .
we put up six different tastes there , or 24 different tastes , and we &apos;ve put two things on , first of all , i &apos;ve been looking at two things : first , i would be more people , and try to get more people &apos;s hands .
it &apos;s more people left when it was 24 percent , when it was six , about 40 percent , about 40 percent .
and after that , we looked at what the people would buy more and less of a glass .
now we saw the opposite effect .
and the people who were standing there were when it was 24 percent , actually , just three percent of the glass .
from the people who were standing as it were six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of glass .
now , if you calculate it , people bought six times more a glass , who they had six to the choices when they had 24 to the choices .
now , to decide not to buy glass , you know , to be good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the most powerful thing is that we can also affect very much decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it &apos;s going to be against our own best interests .
so , the day of the day , financial benefits .
i &apos;m going to describe you now a study that i &apos;m doing with a computer scientist , and i &apos;m doing a computer , and i &apos;m doing a computer , and i &apos;m doing a little bit of the puzzle , which is the most powerful , which we were doing , in the order of retirement , almost a million americans in the entire united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of the world &apos;s population was possible to be able to be able to be able to get a copy of the copy , the chances of the way that it &apos;s going to be saved for tomorrow .
and we found that there was a relationship in fact .
so in these plans , we had about a little bit of a professional plans that people offered something between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund were offered that , in fact , the rate of participation was lower .
now , if you look at the extreme , the plans , the two fund , one of the primary people in the &apos; 70s -- still not as high as we want to .
in the plans that are almost 60 , the most expensive , the most expensive now , was about the most violent percent .
now , even if you were to participate , even if you were more options , even if you were more options , even it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate in the more ways that the more possibilities were available to you , the more they were judged it and to choose to choose .
the more ways of giving you the money , the more they put their money in pure arms .
no one of these extreme decisions , to the decisions that someone would recommend , if you care about your future financial well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen the most significant negative consequences that are providing more and more choices with it .
it &apos;s going to push the decision -- push them up , even if it &apos;s going to be the best interest .
they &apos;re more likely to make worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re going to decide to be more interested in things that they ask themselves less , even if they make it objective better .
the main reason for this is that we might enjoy it , maybe , these huge strands of sand , mustard , transporting and industrial , but we can &apos;t actually compare the comparison and the limitations and then actually can choose the fantastic supply of the amazing supply .
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we &apos;ve tested in different ways and different levels of information -- they can just apply in their business .
first , just just simple .
they &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true today that less .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; just more . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they lose their own .
but in fact , we see it more and more that if you &apos;re ready to be willing to be more prosperous , and the persistent pragmatic possibilities will be , well , there &apos;s a rising increase of sales , and there &apos;s a cost of sales , and there &apos;s a improvement of the world &apos;s population .
as a result , the kind of stroke and gamble , the different head and a lot of 26 , and the way that they were in 15 , they experienced a rising increase for sales to 10 percent .
when the golden computer corporation sell her 10 at the worst , the most popular , they found that the profit were growing around 87 percent -- an outcome of both the rise of sales and reducing cost of cost .
you know , the average of the average today is to give you 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart offers you today .
but the main supermarket , which is today &apos;s supermarket , is the world &apos;s supermarket , and they &apos;re just offering them 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in a dose .
now in the world of the world &apos;s life , i think one of the best examples that we &apos;ve been doing recently on the market is how to best make choice , was something that david &apos;s got very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s been offered at harvard .
every single harvard employee takes a place automatically on a computer company .
those who want to make a choice , 20 fund , are not going to fund 300 or more fund .
you know , how many people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to do it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different .
and if your employees can &apos;t get them , it can &apos;t be your customers . &quot;
now before we started today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to give all people in this audience , to the most beautiful streets of the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read you the way .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a couple of seconds to read them and then please go to clap , if you &apos;re ready to take the gary &apos;s service .
okay . everybody &apos;s ready to assume the offer of gary .
are that all ?
well , let me show you something more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who is ready for this journey .
i think i may have heard more hands .
good .
the fact that you see the objective of the first time , more information had been than the second time , but i would know it &apos;s the thing that they thought of the second time .
because the images made it for them physically .
what brings me to the second technology that helps you cope with the problem of the world &apos;s problem is the most powerful .
it &apos;s about understanding people to understand the difference between possibilities , understanding what the consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that consequences are really vivid and they have to be felt specific .
why are people going to spend 15 to 30 percent more if they &apos;re using a car card or a card card , when they &apos;re using a credit card ?
because it &apos;s not really money that we feel .
and it turns out that if you make it , it &apos;s a very good tool , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people .
so we &apos;ve done a study that i made with a computer of design and visualizing the design of the design , we &apos;ve made a study with people who worked on the street -- employees who have been working for the most violent -- and these people were all in a meeting where they signed their participation .
and as this session , we &apos;ve just leave this session as it was always , just we added a little thing .
the little that we have to have to confess was that we asked people to think about all positive things that would happen in their lives if they would save money .
in the case we did this simple thing , there was a total increase of participation around 20 percent and there was a number of people who were willing to save or a rise to four percent of the amount of money they were willing to pay for for the most violent .
the third technology : the third technology .
we can handle more categories than more choices than more choices .
so here &apos;s for example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a computer scanner .
it turns out it &apos;s in the northern industry , and down in the northeast area , the number between the number of papers has been pushed up to the very top of the other species of magazines to the top of the other species .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 papers , and you put them in 10 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 papers , and these in 20 categories , they believe that i gave you more choices and a better health rate , and i think i gave you the 400 .
because the categories tell me how to keep them apart .
here are two different types of data .
a &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; jazz . &quot;
if you think that the left display is the same , and the ad on jazz is , then they clap into hands .
okay , there &apos;s a few .
if you think that the on the left of jazz is and the ones that are on the right is , please clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the on the left is jazz and the right is a bit of a , but you know what ?
this is a profoundly high school of plastic .
the categories have to say something , not that the choice is causing .
and this problem is often , if you look at the long bullet points , all of these fund .
who are you doing that ?
my fourth technique : premise for complexity .
it turns out we can actually deal with more information than we think we have to simplify them .
we need to increase complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german carpenter , who gives you the opportunity to get your car completely .
they have to make 62 different decisions to create their car completely .
now these decisions are different in the number of choices that they provide per choice .
and the car &apos;s car , the car , the car -- i &apos;ve got 56 possibilities .
motors , gears -- four possibilities .
what i &apos;m doing now is i change the order that we &apos;re making .
half of the customers are going to be about the many possibilities , 56 percent of the opportunities , four rows .
the other half of the customers are about the small ways , four rows , to the 56 percent , many possibilities .
what am i looking at ?
how do they care about it ?
if you use the more of the time in the decision , that means that they &apos;re overwhelmed , the most powerful , i &apos;m losing them .
what you find is that people who go from the many to the low , and they always choose the most small to the most small .
we lose them .
go from the little choices to the many , then they stay .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is change the order of this information .
when i start with the simple start , i learn how to do it .
even though the gears choose to me nothing about my preferences at the interior , it &apos;s still getting me to pick it up .
it also tells me about the great product that i &apos;m going to do , and i &apos;m willing to get to that with interest with interest .
let me summarize .
i told you about four techniques that the problem of the world &apos;s problem is -- just -- will be the surplus alternatives ; it &apos;s -- -- you can get it real ; we can get better , put it on , and get it out of complexity , and get rid of complexity .
each of these techniques i &apos;m telling you today is to help you manage the opportunities -- good for you , you can use it for yourself , good for people who offer service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you pick up with the choices .
and the more we choose to pick up , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin , who &apos;s at youtube , and i &apos;m looking at youtube .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are distributed , and then , therefore , why is that important .
we all want to be stars -- wake up , singers , comedians -- when i was young , it seemed so much difficult .
but the point of energy has enabled us to get all of our creative activities to be very famous in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to the next saturday .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours per minute , there are more than 48 hours per minute .
again , just a tiny percentage of the ever distributed and it will be looked at thousands of times and so on to the cultural moment .
so how does that work ?
three things : the more powerful , the unexpected and the unexpected .
well , we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
whoa !
so , the internet , the street .
last year , the video company sent this video that he was shot in the national national park in the world in the world in the world in the world .
in 2010 , it was 23 million times .
this chart shows how it was the first time that the video was popular for the first time .
actually , a viral video didn &apos;t want to do a viral video .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing that , if you &apos;re in a rut , you &apos;re going to do it in a lifetime of time .
he had uploaded a lot of water .
and this video was actually been sent in january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jimmy dunlap .
jimmy paravicini sent the tweet that was so popular at the end of the day .
because the kind of french , like jimmy , are making us new and interesting things and show them a big audience .
it &apos;s a friday friday , friday . you get down on friday on friday , and you know , i &apos;m going to get the street &apos;s back to the friday , a friday , friday , friday , friday , friday , friday , and you would have been talking about that conversation , i hope to go to the conversation , i hope .
rebecca marsh : a friday of the top of the year .
it was almost 200 million times a year .
so the graph looked like this .
just like &quot; double , &quot; it seems to be out of nowhere .
what happened to this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s right .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also more nuanced .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , the most disturbing thing that we did on the face of a lot of blogs started to write about it .
michael j. nelson &apos;s science was a first one who was doing a joke to twitter about it .
and it &apos;s important that a person or a group of a group of people took a point of view , and they would give a place to a big audience , and it &apos;s accelerating the process .
then this community formed of people who shared this big joke , and they started talking about it and to talk to it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 more , a friday of the friday at youtube .
already in the first seven days , there was a prosthetic for every single week .
unlike the 20th century of the 20th century , the participation community is the participation of the community , to become part of the way we &apos;re spreading or something new .
&quot; the cat &apos;s favorite &quot; is animation and music in the world .
that &apos;s it , just simple .
this year , it was almost 50 million times .
and if you hold that for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a little bit of a food that was seen four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats that look at this video .
and the importance is , creativity , the creativity that &apos;s in the brain of the world and the geeks .
there were remixes .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole whole business set of the ground , which made it a stupid joke to something that we all can participate .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure , we do it .
who could have been able to anticipate this ?
who would have predicted &quot; double &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; rebecca black &quot;
what &apos;s the kind of thing that they could write in their writing , where they were doing this ?
in a world where every minute of video is uploaded to video , only unique and unexpected , it can just be unique and unexpected .
i &apos;m not going to be interested in that , i was not very interested in my friend , i should look at this great video , about a guy who &apos;s in new york for bicycles .
i got a ticket because i &apos;m not on the street , but i &apos;m often there , but there &apos;s a lot of disabilities that don &apos;t get a very careful job on the ground .
and this is a very surprising thing , and humorous was casey , casey , casey , and his argument for five million times .
this is what we &apos;re doing for everything new , which we do .
and that &apos;s what leads us to a big question ...
what does that mean ?
so , the computer .
what does that mean ?
and the creative design , creative design , is the characteristics of a new way of media and culture , to everybody , and in the audience , that the audience has very strongly determined .
as i said , one of the biggest stars -- justin bieber -- made his beginning at youtube .
nobody needs to give your ideas green light .
and today we &apos;re all feeling as owners of our culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media and they &apos;re not making them even on the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how can i talk about the connectedness between women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of this connectedness is a child &apos;s disease when she was about 30 years ago with her little sister , and she &apos;s going to be talking about a little bit of the day -- that little girl , which is a little girl &apos;s living and a day of the day , and now you &apos;re talking about this little girl , and you &apos;re talking about it in a little bit of the middle of the baby .
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s still being put together .
i want to tell you about some of the most popular .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life was given from the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
if you hold it in the front of the outhouse , you can see the way that he has to have a single waste .
the words , so long his friends , now he &apos;s going to be .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never had to be reminded me .
i had to worry that it wasn &apos;t free , and it was my job to learn that the story was not trying to crush us , but we went out .
the next piece of puzzle shows how a boat in the early days is silent .
my mother may be 18 , when her father died -- in a prison , before a little girl , with two little girls .
for them , life had their job : the escape of their family and a new life in australia .
it was completely disconnected that she could fail to fail .
after a four-year-old and a half , a little bit of a boat , a boat on the sea , as a computer , is being abused .
all the adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear they had , foreign and death , had .
as most adults on the boat wearing my mother , a little bit of a plastic .
in a computer book , i had only had my sister and i , and then i drink her and my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the steady design of the engine , the clapping of the engine , the big and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates who came up with many times , but from the most violent of the men on our boat , or the most of the men , the six hours of the engine didn &apos;t want to launch .
but i remember the lights of the street of the coast coast , and the young man , who collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first to me , the first one of the men on the platform .
no apple has ever tasted this again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next thing is about four women in three generations that are developing a new life .
we were leaving in the wild , one of the new populated suburb , which is the population of the city of the city .
unlike the most sacred , their existence was completely unknown , there was no one in northern africa .
the smell from the world &apos;s population came from the rest of the world .
and the most powerful broken car had been between people who had one thing in common : they started new .
my mother worked on farms , then on a post post in a prison , six days , twice .
it kind of managed to find her time , and they have to teach english and to be able to get english .
we were poor .
every dollar was given to be supported and became in another education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do for that , most of the things that came out of the second hand .
two of them , for school , for school , to cover the holes in the other .
one of the things that you have to do is to get six years to the top of the road , because she had to reach six years .
and there were the rare , painful , painful , and there and there and there &apos;s a lot of time : &quot; asian , &quot; goes home .
after home , where ?
something is a little bit more fun in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a quiet voice , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other about each other , and we heard the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother suffered to the boat from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until her nightmares came to the , so i could wake her up .
she opened a computer , and then she got a business and a business set .
and the women came to the stories of men who don &apos;t have the change , angry and more , and they were eating children , and they were caught between two worlds .
loans and sponsors were looked for .
centers were built .
i lived in the refugee .
in one was i was the classic asian student , who was the most violent demands of himself .
in the other one , i was in insecure life , who was terrified of the violence , the most tragic scars and the isolation .
but so many got over the years .
and because of this help , i became the last year of the summer of the year , as a young scientist of the year .
and i was drawn from a satellite to the next , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous of the comic , was now tan le , refugee and social activist , who was invited to talk to places that she had never heard , and in homes , whose existence had never imagined her .
i was not familiar with the payback .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the most powerful .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to the routine and the comfort of life of a unknown life , a grandmother and two daughters who were so natural to each of their days as natural as they were telling each other and the other time , and we &apos;re still in bed .
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old as she was at the time when we got the boat down .
no one was never a way .
&quot; just say , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about the training of the training and education , and the neglect of the world &apos;s disease and the absence of the world .
and the more open i talked about , the more i should tell .
i met people in all the other classes , so many of you did what they loved , living on the borders of the possible .
and although i graduated , i realized i couldn &apos;t be able to live with a career in business .
there had to be another more sophisticated species .
and i realized that it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , a very embarrassing , a new , new thing , and not just okay , but something you have to be grateful about , maybe a gift of the design system .
because the way that we can do that can be so easily collapse of the horizons , so easily means that you &apos;re accepted the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve gone enough from my favorite point to know that , yes , the world , but not as you can do it .
opportunities that were not allowed to have been implemented , were explicitly encouraged .
there was a energy , an unlimited optimism , a strange soup of humility and the most of the time .
so i followed my gut feeling .
i collected a little team of people to tell me that the box is not going to be a very challenging challenge .
a year we had no cents .
at the end of one pair of tags , i cook a huge amount of soup that we shared .
we worked late at night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant , and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull out the u.s.
after just one trip there .
my gut gut again .
three months later , i moved and i went to the adventure .
before i leave the talk , i &apos;d like to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time when the social norm and the local college was the most important person .
life had not changed for centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother was moving her alone .
with 17 , she became the second woman of a college class whose mother she proposed .
without support of man &apos;s husband , she was worried about the way it was taking him in front of court and was a greater deal in her own case , and a greater deal than she won .
&quot; don &apos;t suck up as a false .
i just decided to go in a hotel hall in sydney when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the most violent and i saw them on the other side .
i knew she had come to go to the next door .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went to a buddhist temple in a buddhist temple , sitting in the closet .
we told her stories and locke , that we were still at their own .
and to midnight , the monk came and said he had to close the coffin .
my mother asked us to touch your hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because they &apos;ve been holding them for this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t leave them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s going to be through the women .
you see who we were and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men who might come in our lives would be us in the way we could get into the way .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own kids , and i think i still think about the boat .
who would ever want to wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , in front of the hidden , before the day .
can i give you a bug in your life , which is courageous every wave , which is the most courageous , steady , steady of the engine , the long horizon , which doesn &apos;t have to have ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and you could certainly be able to do it , i would do it .
and also , the mother &apos;s mother today is in the fourth or five hundred .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with them .
is it all photography ?
because that &apos;s a picture that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
but i started interested in photography , when i got my first digital digital digital , at age 15 years .
i put it with my former preference for drawing , but it was a little different , because using the camera was actually the process in planning .
and if you take a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you press the cause .
so for me , it seemed to be more about the fact that photography was going to be on the right place to be the right place .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that the process starts when the trigger is going to be .
photographs like this : a site along a lot of the road is a lot of the road .
but it has a unexpected twist .
and yet , a realistic level .
or photos like this -- dark and the other thing , but all with the common goal , a realistic level .
if i say reality , i &apos;m going to be a college .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but i want to let it look like you could have , on a photo .
photographs where you have to think a little moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it look realistic ?
does it go to the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the point is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how they can make it available on a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what &apos;s realistic , but what we think we &apos;re realistic about .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see it as a puzzle of reality , where you can take different pieces and put it together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we &apos;ve got three perfect things here , and we &apos;ve all got to identify with all of us in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , they can create something that &apos;s still going to look three-dimensional , as if it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so we &apos;re drawn to our brains because our brains are just not really making sense of it .
and i see the same process in combining photographs .
it &apos;s really about combining different realities .
so the things that make a visual look realistic , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , the things we &apos;re doing around our lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because it just looks kind of wrong .
so i would say , there are three simple rules to follow , to get a realistic outcome .
as you can see , this is not three special images .
but you can do something special like this .
so the first rule is that combined photographs should have the same perspective .
second , combined photographs should have the same thing .
and these two pictures are put these two behaviors -- the same altitude shot , and the same thing is the same thing .
third , it &apos;s about making it impossible to make it possible where the individual images start and end by starting them to connect them .
it &apos;s impossible to say how the photo was actually gathered together .
so by using color , contrast and contrast to the edges , they admire the individual images , as usual , the way that we look at the surface of the different images and the brain , and the same picture , although a picture can basically contain hundreds of levels .
here &apos;s another example .
you may think that &apos;s just a landscape , and the bottom part was manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely exposed to photographs of different places .
i personally get a lot of time to create a place to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to take any compromise with the ideas in its head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew i needed several months to plan them to find them to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on a mountain floor .
the bank is from a different place .
the most popular thing comes from a quarry .
and yes , i even have the house up on the island of red , to let it look like this .
so to get a realistic outcome , it &apos;s from me to planning out of planning .
i always start with a act , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s a very good piece of information .
and then if you make good images , the result is pretty beautiful , and also pretty realistic .
so , it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that we &apos;re doing is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic plastic blocks fail .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we &apos;ve introduced to the most successful was to take a more of a sudden .
it &apos;s not particularly scientifically -- you &apos;re a cup of coffee or tea , and the patient , the patients , families , &quot; how do you ? &quot;
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all of them -- perhaps most of the electronic industrial systems , because we stopped listening .
this is my favorite thing . a very simple thing .
she has a button , and it &apos;s from the / .
and every morning i jump on that .
and yes , i have a job as you might recognize .
i have my job to intervene at 95 lbs .
it &apos;s just working : every time i get on the scale , they also send my data to google health .
and there you are going to be , by my favorite , and it can tell you where my favorite student is , and it &apos;s not just in the moment that i &apos;m going to support , and that &apos;s what i need to see , but also with a look at the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you know that , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 more lt on twitter .
so every morning i jump on my ted phone and people talk to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; lunch , &quot; i &apos;m like , &quot; lunch just a little loaf , &quot; to lunch . &quot;
but this is the most important thing that can happen because this is the pressure pressure , to help pay patients , because that could be used against obesity , or it could be patients smoking .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and to bring them together , some kind of game to control their health better .
coming up next week , that &apos;s coming on the market .
it will give you a little bit of the little plastic that you &apos;re going to do on a iphone or something .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure , sending it to their doctor , to give him a little bit of time to share with others , for something more than 100 dollars .
in this point , the patients come in . they can &apos;t only take control of the tube , the captain on their own ship , but also help us in health care , and the health care system , and the health care system , and so on .
do it , make a little bit of use , and start to hug them with this , to add patients in the team .
and you can do that through these kinds of ways , but also by farmville .
and one of the things we did , i want to share with you a quick video .
we have all the most sophisticated in our cars .
maybe even in our mobile phones .
we know exactly where all the equipment are around around the ground .
we know one , where all the stations are .
and clear , we can find a lot of things .
but where would the next ted test to help this patient ?
we have a lot of time , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next life-saving were going to be in this moment .
so what did we do ? we did an ambigram in the netherlands .
we built a website and asked a crowd , &quot; if you see a computer scanner , please share with us where he &apos;s on , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s closed while he &apos;s closed , of course .
and over 10,000 years old , they &apos;ve been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find apps for this .
and we &apos;ve created a design system .
we &apos;ve developed an app for a long-term basis , augmented reality to find these kinds of things .
and if you &apos;re in a city like a car , and someone can get you , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks you have your own , and you can see the next two years of life .
and we &apos;re not just going to just go to this as a design tool , like the product called the product , but also introduce as a design model .
and we want to bring this up on a worldwide level .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , so that we can help to behave like the way they behave to make these kinds of things around the world .
and if you &apos;re in holiday and someone &apos;s going to be flowing , it &apos;s your own internal or somebody else can find a little bit of a plastic .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies on the world are helping us help the world &apos;s recognition .
these could be the kind of dna , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the most powerful thing is that the most powerful thing is to be on its location .
please help us and try to make it better , but to take the health .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report by unexpected discoveries .
i work in the most violent .
and my little little little bit , that we want to make the environment , by doing it ...
... it gives you the alert attention .
here &apos;s a quick video about what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take , until it &apos;s cut .
now -- we can just skip this -- i &apos;ll just jump to the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
so , the point is ...
oh , my time is over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design , a year to break off , and work in a environment that &apos;s so much , which is really what they hate , we &apos;ve worked in government .
the program is called &quot; code for america &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the design for geeks .
we &apos;re going to choose some fellows and we &apos;ll let them work with a lot of people .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them into a more concrete world .
and they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what you really do is to show what &apos;s possible today with technology .
so they meet al .
al is a national street in the city of boston .
here it looks like he looks for a date , but what he really looks like is someone who &apos;s going to be doing it when he &apos;s a little bit of the snow , because he knows he &apos;s not very good in the prison industry when he &apos;s a meter of snow .
how did he come to look for this particular kind of help ?
we had a team of fellows in boston , which is the code for america in the code for america .
they were there in february , and it &apos;s a lot of more painful .
and they realized that the city never had to take away the fire cell .
but a fellow fellow , a man named erik ornish , noticed something else and that was that the residents were taking the sidewalks out of the line right before these parts .
so he did what everybody would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire fire .
you can make it free to lift it , if it &apos;s drying up .
if you do that , you can give it a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take it away .
so there &apos;s a nice little game game .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that have written the fellows in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other kind of thing .
it &apos;s spreading rapidly .
there &apos;s this guy in the middle of the city , which has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but , so the citizens adopt the citizens of the brain .
it &apos;s very important that these are the most powerful , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them out .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the app to get the citizens to clean up the fundraising .
and chicago has just introduced them to the people who have the most powerful , when it &apos;s drying up .
we know now nine cities that are planning to use this app .
and it has been very competent , organic , of course .
if you know something about the internet , you know it &apos;s not that way .
the process of software is basically a few years .
we had a team that worked last year in boston , for the three people two months .
it was a way to figure out the parents , which are the right public schools for their children .
we later told us that if it was going to go across the normal channels , it took over two years , and it would have cost about two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not yet .
there &apos;s a project in the california sector that has only two billion dollars , which has cost two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spread from the point of view , is a kind of shot before the front of the government on the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- not more like a private company , like many people think that it should be .
and not even like a car , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , that app is that you represents a new generation that &apos;s dedicated to the problem of government -- not as the problem of a football institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at the collective act with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to create things effectively in common .
it &apos;s not just code for america , and there are hundreds of people in all the country , who are up and writing up , every day in their own communities .
they don &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re dreadful with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they don &apos;t repair them .
and these people know something we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all have your feelings about politics and the snake and all the other things that we really get upset with , the state of tim o o york , &quot; what we &apos;re doing in common , that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
today , a lot of people have given up the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , please , i &apos;m going to tell you that you &apos;re going to change it , because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government finally takes their power from us -- they &apos;re going to be : &quot; we &apos;re going to do the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it , how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government when i started this program .
and as many people , i thought it &apos;s mainly about choosing people in office .
now , after two years , i came to the conclusion that it &apos;s especially in community communities , to be a lot of time .
this is the call for service and information .
there you are usually out of that when you were in a lobotomy .
if you ever have to work in the way to work in your urban call , like our fellow scott mcchrystal , as part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re going to see that people who call government , including a lot of different problems , including that a drug company is going to be in their house .
scott is going to get this kind of thing .
he would say &quot; the &quot; guide &quot; in the official database .
and he &apos;s not really a idea . he starts with the computer &apos;s eye .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play it very loud , and see if the livestock is going to be ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the world &apos;s tail .
in boston , it &apos;s not just a call call .
it has an app , a computer , a computer and a half , called &quot; the &quot; hippo scare . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is the work very clever people in the office of the new urban desert in boston .
one day -- this is a real report -- this is where it was , &quot; in my controlled zone , can &apos;t say if she &apos;s dead .
how do i get it away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; the &quot; design of &quot; is different .
scott approached himself from human to human .
but on &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; is all public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next one we &apos;ve got was , &quot; i went over there , found the controlled process behind the house .
the internet is ? yes . alive ?
turned the trash on the side . went home .
good night , sweet , sweet . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . this is the physical one .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is getting into turin .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m more talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government was playing a central role here .
they were working these two people .
and you could have connect them to government services if they would need , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to state services .
if a neighbor helps the other , we empower our communities .
let &apos;s call the most powerful , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think about it , is that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they think that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is that we choose to choose .
how often did we choose a political leader -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy to choose a new political leader -- and then we &apos;re going to go back and we expect the government to reflect our values and then not changed the government , and then it doesn &apos;t change much ?
that &apos;s because the government is a further ocean and politics are the top of the world .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with this contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that we have , which we have , and for the we pay , something that works against us , something else , and then we &apos;re going to be ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want that institution to work for us , we have to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the actual body function is happening .
we need to be able to do the tools of government .
so the most important thing has done .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of more concerned of a very detailed report written a very detailed report , which is a response to the most powerful of the brain .
this is not politically active , which is an active ingredient .
now for those of us who have given up the government , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we &apos;re going to leave our children .
you have to introduce the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
do we really believe that we have to reach what we need to do without improving an institution that can be in the name of us all ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of government fundamentally can achieve the function of government , which can actually achieve a society by being avoided .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the internet , and the internet knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you have to just build the systems right now .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost one generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up with the voice of granted .
they don &apos;t fight this battle that we all fight , that &apos;s why who can talk to everybody ; they all have to talk .
you can make your opinion , to every single channel , and you do it .
so , if you &apos;re faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the work of government .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities .
this could be , a fire fire , to petrochemicals , a trash bag with a fire station .
and sure , if we could have these fire cells , all of the time , we could have a lot of people doing it .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers who are paying taxes and they &apos;re willing to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get money .
we are more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve the government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all got for you here : if it &apos;s about the great , important things we need to do together , all together , we &apos;re just going to be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
usually my role to explain the people like wonderful technologies , which are the emergence of the site , and i thought , there i am under friends , i would tell you what i really think is going to be , and to understand what really happens to be , and to understand what &apos;s really going on .
i &apos;m going to start with you a little bit of a boring slide .
you could just show the slide .
this is a slide that i &apos;ve chosen from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but it &apos;s actually about the general form .
this slide shows data of an analysis of the performance of the performance of the performance of a field of the power area of a field of field networks .
the interesting thing here is that this slide , as many others , which we often find in our field , is a kind of a place on a surface of a curve .
in other words , every step here is a power in the brain .
and this is a novelty that we need to use this guy scale on the ground of technology in the technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could turn the lights back .
something shorter , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper here .
now , why do we draw graphs in technology on the ground of the news ?
the reason i would draw it on a normal curve , where , say , this is the years , so the timeline of a kind , and this is a common amount of technology that i want to show you , then , the graph of silly , then the graph is silly .
so that &apos;s what you see .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us much .
now , if i want to map a different technology , we &apos;ll say a little bit , then it would be very irrational to come on in the scale of the scale , in form of a flat line .
but if something like this happens , it changes the conditions .
so if the most powerful way of the world &apos;s climate change would be so fast , we could get a taxi in a taxi and be in 30 seconds we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not so fast .
and that was never before the history of the world &apos;s history , this kind of carbon growth , which is the scale of all the few years , which is increased all the time .
the question i want to ask you is , if you look at this exponential curves , you can &apos;t see it forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything forever and forever is moving as fast as now .
there are two ways .
either of it is a classic classic , like here , to come up with something completely new , or it will happen here .
this is in about .
well , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think this is going to happen in the way that i &apos;m going to happen .
so , this is really , then we &apos;re in the middle of this right now in a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition of the world , a new kind of world .
so the question i want to ask , and i also often , myself , is , is this new world going to be ?
what is this new state that keeps the world slowly ?
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing to be in the middle of the city .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in 2000 and people often talked about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
we &apos;re not going to go on .
so in other words , the future has wiped out a year for me to have been a year in this world .
i think the reason is that we &apos;re going to realize that there &apos;s something happening in it .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we know that right now it doesn &apos;t make sense to try to look at 30 or 50 years into the future because everything will be so different that a simple one of what we &apos;re doing now is not a sense of what makes it a little bit of a sense of what we &apos;re doing now .
now i want to talk about what that might be , this transition in which we are right now .
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things about some other things , which really don &apos;t have a technology with technology or computers .
because i think that really can be understood to be a step back , and we look at the thing on a longer strand .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at in the world &apos;s 30-year zone .
i think the big picture makes sense when you split it into some of the types of things .
so let &apos;s go back , and that &apos;s 2.5 billion years , the earth was a big , highly balanced , a lot of it , with a lot of it .
now , if you look at the way these chemicals were organized , then we give us a pretty good picture about how they &apos;re the most prolific .
i also believe there are theories that start to understand how everything has started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a lightning story about what &apos;s going to be that little oil oil , which is different types of tobacco for chemicals .
some of these oil caps had a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate different chemicals from outside and grow .
all the things that were started began .
these little oil spills were the most primitive animal .
but these oil spills were not about living in today &apos;s sense , because every single one of them was just a little , skinny recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , the chemicals have to be dispersed to more unequal amounts of chemicals .
so every droplet was a little different .
in fact , the droplet was growing up , which had a growth of the economy faster than others and integrated more and more chemicals from outside and shared faster .
so this is a constant way to survive longer and it bursts into the more dramatic dimension .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , if these droplet were learned a trick about abstraction .
in any way , which we don &apos;t really understand , these droplet have learned the ability to use information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and that &apos;s a certain chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they have found this in this brain , evolutionary way , which allowed them to have a way of doing what they were doing , so that this information could be stored and made it copied .
the amazing thing about it is that this kind of information is going to store information from 2.5 billion years , in which they were born , right ?
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same notation .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s used in every condition , and the same code .
we &apos;re so far that we can write , just to the most successful , even in this code .
and i have 100 of a white white white white , which i &apos;m trying to keep away from the street of the street .
in this , what i &apos;ve done is , i took this code -- the code is made out of normal letters , which we use to address -- and i wrote my business card on a piece of dna and i have 10 ^ 22 times .
so if somebody wants a hundred million copies of my business business , i have enough for everybody in this room , and even for everybody on this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was in fact , i &apos;d been a little bit of a business , and then i &apos;d have written it on a virus and blew it up in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna of dna was a more interesting step .
and the most important one that these cells -- it made them happy for another billion years .
but then another one , very interesting step , which was completely different , and that cells started to communicate and communicate information , so that communities were born by cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually exchange their dna .
so , this is why the pest is growing for antibiotics .
some bacteria have found out how to get from penicillin and have this information together with other bacteria in the dna and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate each other .
so this communication allowed for the reasons to be community , which was in a certain way , and they were a little bit of a sudden .
so they either survived together , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all individuals were getting more frequently repeated , and they &apos;ve been rejected by evolution .
the main line is now where these communities are so close to the fact that they decided to write the recipe for all the community in a more productive place .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at that point , we have a blueprint to have communities of many of the most powerful , which are acting together as single organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also such a kind of a community community .
we have a lot of cells that are not going to be asked to be in itself .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , cells and so on .
so these communities started changing , so the level , which was the evolution , not longer , the individual cell was , but the whole thing that we call organism .
the next step is now happening within this communities .
the main process began to abstract information .
and they developed special structures that didn &apos;t make anything else than information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the most powerful , which is the ones that have built these .
they started to train specialists within the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and that information of information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
and this gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point , an individual -- learning in the time of the life of a single organism , rather than about this evolutionary period .
so , an organism could learn to eat a certain kind of weapons , because they liked bad and made him sick , the last time he had eaten her .
now , this could happen within the lifespan of a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , that had been learned because this information had to be learned from the individuals that died because of these fruit systems , because they weren &apos;t there .
so the nervous system has the most dramatic system of this particular kind of thing because evolution could now happen within a individual .
she could be in a time of time .
what happened after that , the individual organisms were able to communicate , to communicate each other .
so , as an example , the most popular version of this kind of thing is the human language .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , very complicated , confused idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically taking a little bit of sound from me , in the hope that a similar idea of the idea is to create a kind of creepy idea in your head that has a certain resemblance .
so we take something very complicated , it turns out in sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated to the heads of others .
so this allows us to work as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we , we have humanity , is we started abstract .
we &apos;re going through the same stages that have been through the same line of water -- the abstraction of our methods , how we put data , we present , processing .
the invention of language for example was a little step in this direction .
and the computer , computers , the computer , the hypertext and so on , are all our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve built in our community to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also can be able to develop faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today , evolution can happen in the time of microseconds .
you &apos;ve seen a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of evolution where he showed a little evolution in the &quot; design program &quot; program , right before your eyes .
so we have the most violent time again .
the first steps of history , which i told you , took a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , took a few hundred million years .
then the steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
and the next steps , like electronics , seem very few decades to take .
the process is feeding itself , and so , i think , i think , the word of this is the word for this -- if something is more profitable .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explosion .
we see the process that &apos;s feeding itself .
i live from building computers from computers and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism to build computers , not using it , without the recently possible progress in computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design this in traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor does in the most violent .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead , and what the designers of thinking is , we think of a certain kind of a game , and we &apos;re thinking about this machine and the machine is doing something that our skills are beyond , better and faster than we could ever do it ourselves .
and it makes it part of the techniques that we don &apos;t even understand right now .
a method which is particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been doing in the last time is the evolution itself .
we put a team of a team in the machine that &apos;s going to be taken in the field of the brain .
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that &apos;s made out of random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , &quot; please , please have a hundred million randomly randomly randomly available sequences of instructions .
now , please take all these random instructions , take all the programs , and then pick all the programs that are the next one that i &apos;m doing on the next . &quot;
so in other words , i define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to make numbers out of a few that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve been using for this .
so , find programs that are most likely to sort of make a number of things .
of course , the chance of random instruction randomly is very small that they just dreamed of random numbers , so they &apos;re probably not going to be able to do that .
but one of those things is that you &apos;re lucky to get two numbers into the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences that come out of the next .
store that , the rest of the room .
now all the senior people who have the numbers of the best test test .
and that &apos;s a method of the design system , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their own , and the children are making the characteristics of the internet of the two programs .
so i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that have come closer to the regulations than others .
say , &quot; please again . &quot;
insult again .
maybe take some mutations .
and try to do this again with another generation .
all of these generations need a few milliseconds .
and so i can go through a evolution of millions of years in the computer , or in a more complicated way , some hours .
i finally get programs that can kind of make numbers of perfect kind of stuff .
the fact is , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i &apos;ve ever written from hand .
and then if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s fuzzy and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know and i &apos;m sure that you do the job , because you come from a series of data programs , which have done the job .
because your life was going to be , if you did the job right .
i sat in a 747 , with marvin minsky , and he &apos;s a map of a map , and he says , &quot; oh look at this . look at this .
there &apos;s , &quot; this airplane is made out of the street of the street , which is working together to make your flight safer . &quot;
we know that a computer company is not optimal when it becomes too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to leave the computer for a process which is very different from classical engineering .
he allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibility of this yet .
so , there &apos;s a lot of fun us .
we &apos;re using these programs to make a lot faster faster , so that we can be able to do this processes faster .
so it creates a more dynamic .
it &apos;s going to be faster and faster and faster and so , i think , why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies of today are feeding themselves .
we raise off .
we &apos;re at a point that is analog at the time , as a result of the world .
so we &apos;re the most powerful and we can &apos;t quite think of what hell we &apos;re doing here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this apartment .
but i really think that after us , something comes out .
i think it &apos;s very much more powerful to say that we are the result of evolution .
and i think we all are here part of the creation of what &apos;s going on next .
now , lunch is before and i think i &apos;m going to hear now before i &apos;m going to get more than i &apos;m going to get even more .
my story begins right here in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was in the galapagos in the desert with the gulf of the desert with a solar company .
we talked about it that nothing has changed since the ancient indian indian indian headquarters . &quot; mahabharata . &quot;
if we wanted indians to travel , we were going to be in a car and we were going to be on the sky .
now we &apos;re doing the airplanes .
and then when the great indian okapi thirst had been , he took a bow , took a bow in the floor and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with the computer and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
that really made me sad .
i was scared of technology .
it was scared that i could lose the ability to be able to enjoy the sunset without a camera and without tweet to my friends .
i found that technology should make magic and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver tape .
this piece of 50 years old was the equivalent of the thing that was called the first thing .
she became a kind of a little bit of a world &apos;s access to a world full of pirates and the ships in my mind .
i came up with the way we were doing our fancy clocks and cameras of it .
they were inspired by us .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic rather than killing .
i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling , the reader on the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it takes pictures and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
the storytelling of storytelling always took more sense .
but what do we do with this ?
i &apos;m just going to go to the very top of a , interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s &quot; make your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s &quot; this box belongs ... &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to get a character in the book .
and again , a letter goes down to me -- and the ipad knows by gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the child in me is really excited about such opportunities .
i talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean the magician and dragon , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies in a glass i found always quite exciting .
so you have to blow up the ipad and the fireflies are dropping down .
and the light is the way that the rest of the book .
another idea that i was fascinated with as a child is that a whole galaxy can put a whole galaxy in a single portal .
and so every book is going to be a little bit of a marble , and every world i put here to the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
and the whole maps had always been maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows and it &apos;s going to be used to the rest of the book .
she &apos;s also showing other places in the book .
i &apos;m going here .
it &apos;s important for me to create something that is a lot of time , but also very much .
this is the most profound one .
we &apos;ve heard all of the dna and the most violent , but how many people outside india know their indian colleagues that are the most powerful ?
the poor were caught thousands of years in southern chambers , in a old book book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary history for children .
a story that deals with new issues like the most of the time .
on the subject of a big problem , a big problem of the last 10 years is that children in their rooms are sitting in their own rooms , without coming out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you sent up to a search . you have to go out and collect the camera &apos;s camera , natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of the wooden stones , rocks , and shells .
somehow , the children don &apos;t do anymore .
this is the kind of thing that &apos;s going to come up . you have to go out to make a picture of a flower and tag .
in another chapter , you have to highlight a piece of a piece of water and tag .
so you actually create a digital collection of photos that you can put online .
a child in london shows the picture of a football and says , &quot; oh , today i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; today i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities that are going to connect the world and connect the world together .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning a interaction where you use the video of the ipads and see through augmented reality , an animation that seems to appear on a plant before the house .
and on a place , the screen leaves up with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the sound system , you break up and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the natural forces of technology are getting closer and in the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and we &apos;re closer to the natural world and the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in northern school , prisons or a family .
i spend most of my time with the socially weakest in the world &apos;s most traditional and places that there are a lot of hopelessness .
and to be here at ted , and listening to how stimulating this is , i have a lot of force .
in the short time , one of the things that i realized is , ted has an identity .
you can tell things here , the world &apos;s impact .
and sometimes , if something comes over ted , it gets an meaning and force that otherwise wouldn &apos;t have .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some fantastic presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher have an meaning , but the words of a dedicated teacher are very meaningful .
as a doctor , you can do good . when you &apos;re a doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about power of identity .
i don &apos;t have learned that in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional state of state , which was dominated by an enzyme , and these matriarch was my grandmother .
she was a very strong woman , powerful woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every single single single day .
she was also the beginning of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a football system .
their parents were born in the 40s in virginia as a slave .
she was born around 1985 , and the experience of slavery shaped her view very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but she was also loving .
when i met them as a little boy , she came to me and gave me a storyteller .
they made me so stuck , i couldn &apos;t breathe . then they got me .
one or two hours later , if i came to her , she came to me and said , &quot; i &apos;m going to feel like , &quot; do you feel my embrace ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no , &quot; i said , &quot; i said , &quot; i said , &quot; yes , i said , &quot; i said , &quot; i got it in quiet . &quot;
and she was something that was made that you wanted to be close to her .
the only problem that was that they had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins walked around everywhere .
i remember , i have got to have eight or nine , i woke up one morning , and went to the living room . all my cousins walked around .
my grandmother was at the end of the room and staring at me .
and i thought that this was a game .
i saw her and she was dreaming , but she was very serious .
that was 15 minutes , and then she stood up and came to me over and over and over and over and over . she took me to the hand and said , &quot; come on , you know , i have to talk . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out and said , &quot; i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t have it . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , i said , &quot; yes , i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to see that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you just have to promise me three things , you know . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i &apos;m going to love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby and you have to be with promise that you &apos;re going to take care of you . &quot;
i &apos;m common to my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandma , i &apos;m going to do that . &quot;
and she said , &quot; next to me , you &apos;re always going to do the right thing , &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing .
i thought , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise . i promise . &quot;
and finally she said , &quot; the last thing you need to promise me is that you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the land , in the old , rural and i have a brother who &apos;s a year older and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day , my brother came home and brought this leather beer with my sister and i went to the forest and went to the forest .
we just put it around like that , as well .
then he took a drink of beer and offered my sister &apos;s clothes , and she took them , and then they offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . ok . just ok . do you just do . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , do it . we &apos;re doing this , you &apos;re going to do everything else we do .
i had what she had , your sister , go , a beer .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . do you just do it . &quot;
my brother stare at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? well , what do you do ? &quot;
and he looked at me in the face and said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t always make you crazy because of the conversation with grandma ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells everybody the rest of the grandchildren , &quot; which is special .
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to admit something .
i should not do that .
this is perhaps going to be regulated in public reform .
i &apos;m a 52 years old , and i &apos;m going to have a drop of alcohol , i &apos;ve never drunk .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s a lot of time , i say it &apos;s because identity means power .
if we create the right way of identity , we can tell people things about us , which they don &apos;t believe for .
we can get them to do things that they thought they could not .
of course , my grandmother would tell all her grandchildren , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was during the prison department in prison .
my uncle died of the disease of the disease .
and she believed that this was the issues that we need to care about .
i tried to say something about our experiment .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1957 , 300,000 people were in the prison and in prison .
today , it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest rate of time .
seven million people are released on the edge of a investor or a spherical body .
i think , in my opinion , the world is fundamentally changing our world .
in social and black parts of the population , the population of despair and hopelessness are because of this changes .
one of three of three black black black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , on the los angeles , or with a catcher &apos;s nuclear juice .
in urban communities everywhere -- from los angeles about philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- are 50 to 60 percent of the black young men either in jail , in prison , on the los angeles , on the prison , in the prison , on the los angeles .
our system is not only shaped by questions that have to do with the data of the brain , it &apos;s also governed by poverty .
we have a system that &apos;s treated in this country , which is a lot better than you &apos;re rich and guilty of as poor and innocent .
wealth , not bubbles , affects the result .
but we seem to be very happy with it .
and a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems aren &apos;t our problems .
we have lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a few of these things that are there .
my home state , in the home of a permanent , increases the right to the vote when they &apos;re convicted .
here and today , in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population , in alabama , lost their vote .
we predict that in 10 years the average rate of civic development is so high as the world &apos;s population is going to be so high before the most of the time of the oil .
the silence is a little bit .
i represent kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america is the only country in the world , the most violent kids in jail .
in this country , there are a lifetime of life for children for a lifetime of life .
we &apos;ve got a lot of work .
the only country in the world .
i represent people in the world .
the death penalty issue is a interesting question .
we think because you &apos;ve taught us that the true question is : has a human being made , for a person to die for him , to die of it ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about it , depending on how we see our identity .
the other way is not : does anybody have a death that makes death , but do we make it kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty in america defined by error .
at nine people we &apos;ve executed , one that we have for innocent actions , the improbability and from death row was released .
an amazing thing . one of nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane if nine planes , which are going to take one .
but somehow we can do it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking about this question .
i talk about race and the question , if we have the right , kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i gave my students to my student &apos;s old story . i talk about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , the time against the advent of the u.n. war , to the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
but for the african-american people in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to fear the people who have been scared .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that made her life .
these older people come to me now and say , &quot; mr. , accra , you &apos;re talking , you &apos;re giving people to say that you should stop to say that we &apos;re going to have it for the first time in our nation . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with this . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the conservative and decades of the human being willing to be willing to be willing and apartheid .
and yet , in our country , there &apos;s an dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what the meaning of our actions have in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly breaking together .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to be able to make the process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people have understood that the conservative is not to overcome the willingness to be the willingness to be true and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve held some talks in germany about death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up to my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply troubling , you &apos;re talking about it . &quot;
he said , &quot; germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , it can never give you any more in germany . &quot;
it was just silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we &apos;ve ever been killing the systematic killing of people .
it would be a little bit more powerful from us , consciously , and we &apos;re aware of people . &quot;
i thought about it .
as it would feel , in a world where german state people have had people who had been living in the city , especially if they were under a lot of jews .
it would be testable .
it would be a little bit more balanced .
and yet , in this country , in the states of the old south , we &apos;re going to go -- here &apos;s the risk to death , 11 times higher , if the victims is white , when it &apos;s black . 22 times , when the baby is black , the same states in the world is going to wash people to their body .
and yet , there &apos;s these mental disconnection .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with that , with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are affected also .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities will be made of suffering , abuse , abuse , apartheid .
i &apos;m going to be able to unite both .
because we &apos;re ultimately talking about that we need more hope , more engagement , more commitment to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in a complex world .
for me , it means time to think and talk about the poor , the cognitively , the ones that are never going to be at ted .
but think about a way of being embedded in our own lives .
we all have to believe the last day that we can &apos;t see .
we do this . so we &apos;re rational , so we appreciate that very much .
innovation , creativity , and development , not only come from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this kind of dna that i think you can drive us , not just to be open for all the light and the light , but also for the dark and the dark .
lima ebert : the great news of politicians , once said ,
when we fought in eastern europe against oppression , we wanted to do everything , but what we needed most of them was hope , a mental orientation , the willingness to be , sometimes to be a desperate position , and be witness . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i think is also the most important thing to do .
there &apos;s no distinction to technology and design that allows us to be very , very long , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , drowning and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity is a lot more of us than if we didn &apos;t care about it .
it &apos;s going to touch it deeply .
when i was a young lawyer , i was going to meet the great privilege , pink parks .
again , again , back to the back of the city , again , where she was going to go back to the top of the world , where she was two of the oldest friends , the most violent women who had organized the most organized -- an incredible woman -- and virginia , a white , a white , onion , dr. king , hoo .
so these women were meeting and they were just dancing .
and then , i started calling me , and i said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to go , &quot; i &apos;m going to go , &quot; i want to talk to you , &quot; the city , and we want to talk to .
do you want to go in and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very like . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and i just heard .
it was always so inspiring , so that it was so inspiring .
one day i sat there and listened to these women , and after a few hours , woman &apos;s parks turned to me , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; well , what &apos;s the same thing that &apos;s true to the same thing ?
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to do it against injustice .
and the people who want to help people have been innocent .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the design system .
we want to eliminate global health programs without any potential of children .
we want to do something about death penalty .
we want to reduce the number of death rates .
we want to eliminate the food system . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then she looked at me and said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go . &quot;
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to make you very , very tired . &quot;
then she was rejected by me , and she said to me , put a finger on my face and said , &quot; and so you have to be very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very intimidating . &quot;
and so i think the ted community should be the ted community .
we need to make ways of thinking about this challenges : these problems , this suffering .
because ultimately our humanity , from our humanity .
i learned in my work , i &apos;ve learned very simple things .
i learned a few very simple things .
that we are all more than the worst , what we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for everybody on the planet .
if someone lies , he &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t hear him , he &apos;s not just a lesion .
even who kills someone , isn &apos;t just a murderer .
and because that &apos;s , there &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that has to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with safety in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think too many places that are the opposite of poverty .
and finally , i think , although you &apos;re so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so inspiring , we &apos;re not going to be measured at the end of our technology , not to the things we &apos;re developing , not to our intellect and minds .
finally , a society is not measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged , but how they deal with the poor , the death row , the prisoners .
because in this context , we just start to understand the real amazing things that make us feel .
sometimes i &apos;m losing the balance . a story to end .
sometimes i urge too much .
i &apos;m going to get tired of how we all .
sometimes social beings are struggling to think about the same way that we think about it .
i represent these kids who were very difficult to get convicted of very hard .
i go to the ted team and go to a client who likes to be 13 or 14 years ago , and the adult should be in front of court .
then i wonder : how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn someone into something that he &apos;s not ?
the judge looked at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed on a long time and thought , my god , if an judge can turn us into something else , then he has to have a lot of time .
right , the judge , the judge has a little bit of time .
you should also have something .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think of it anymore , i started working on a bill .
i had a 14 year-old young young young boy as clients .
and i started with this bill . the headline was , &quot; bill , my arms , 14 black clients like a privileged , white , &quot; cancer , &quot; treat a lot of the people . &quot;
in my bill , i explained that error of the world and the police are to consider the police and the police .
there was a crazy line about this in this country that there is nothing more of the time that there is only error error .
the next morning , i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i had just dreamed of this crazy dinosaur , or actually he had written it .
and i didn &apos;t just write him , but sent it to the court .
a few months went and i had just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to the court and i &apos;m telling you this crazy case .
i went into the car and really struck -- overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard to do that .
finally , i went out of my car and went to the court .
when i was the staircase to the court , there was a elderly , black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came down to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and gave me a storyteller .
then he knocked me into the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched something very deep in me , identity that the ability to contribute every single one , to a community of hope .
well , i went to the prison table .
once the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. mashelkar , did you ask this crazy dinosaur ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to argue .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
i had written these crazy things .
and the office came in and forth and office office .
in the most skilled business , the most powerful of people who were angry was that we talked about color , about poverty , about inequality .
i saw the janitors on my school and i went down .
he always looked through the window and could hear the whole thing .
he went down and down .
finally , this older black man came to a very , very enthusiastic of the mountain , and sat down straight behind me , almost on the top of the street .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
during the break , a security company came in , which was that the janitors in the prison care system was .
this is the most profound part of the population running across the elderly .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the sports center ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he saw the most popular , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m in this guy , &quot; i &apos;m not going to be able to say the goal of the young man , don &apos;t give it to the face . give it to the head . &quot;
i &apos;ve come to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far more sophisticated , but that it &apos;s a justice justice .
that we &apos;re not completely developed as humans , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and environmental rights .
that our entire survival of survival is connected to each individual .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , and to connect to humanity , compassion and justice .
and i want to just talk about that , which is just , just say , don &apos;t lose the goal of the eyes . give it not .
they have seen this audience , this community , and i heard a obvious wish to help you and to do something .
what can we do ?
so , the rebel of arrowheads : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a double , a half in this spring where it &apos;s about , actually , a effort to do something about the most powerful , which is the kind of punishment that &apos;s going to flow in the politics of the punishment .
here , in california , for example , you will be a billion dollars for death penalty , a billion dollars for death penalty .
and yet , 46 percent of all the world &apos;s population is not with a kind of false .
56 percent of all the people who are not coming from court .
there &apos;s the chance to do something .
this is a little bit of the money that will be approved to invest in more and more security .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the most powerful in america is extremely decreased .
this is a fact that it &apos;s often asked by the elevated water system .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
well , in fact , the number of the world &apos;s population has not changed very much .
most of the most popular in this country didn &apos;t really find the class of the world &apos;s class .
it was the most uplifting mathematician against drugs .
so the dramatic numbers come to the prisoners .
we &apos;ve got to let ourselves go from the rhetoric of punishment .
now , we have &quot; the &quot; guide &quot; , which is the people who are going to bring up on the bars for a more , for a computer company , for a design , for the theft of the good , rather than that you force them to give up the victims .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a football system , not less .
and i think our current current is not helping us .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
and they actually have a string of the object that they &apos;ve been doing here .
they &apos;re an inspiring personality .
thank you for ted . thank you very much .
bin laden is taking a constant increase with a constant .
i &apos;m interested in famine : famine of the police , three : spray of the police .
four : inevitable , the speaker &apos;s speaker .
six : social decline .
the speaker &apos;s speaker .
different speakers . mass destruction . tornado .
recession . a standstill . the world &apos;s -- egypt . syria .
crisis . death .
oh my god .
so these are just a few clips that i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could be the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media would prefer to show us negative themes because our minds are given attention to the attention of the mind .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second every day , our senses will start much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first station is for all the information that the amygdala is part of our temporal lobes .
so the amygdala is our early detection system , our transportation system .
it monitors and the whole information on the search for any relationship in the search of any relationship in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; if it &apos;s a little bit of time , demand &quot; is very true . &quot;
now , with all our digital devices , the week that seven days a day , 24 hours a day , the day of all these negative news is that we &apos;re not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that it &apos;s always bad .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
perhaps the vast progress is accelerating , which we &apos;ve done in the last century through a series of forces , so that it &apos;s going to be possible to create a world of abundance .
well , i don &apos;t say we don &apos;t have a big problem -- climate crisis , water , water and energy problems -- we already have .
and as humans , we are much better at analyzing problems on very long periods , but they eventually overcome it .
so let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has more than doubled , which has been devoted to inflation in the world &apos;s length of the world &apos;s population .
child mortality has a tenth of mortality .
and that &apos;s what the most important thing is , the most powerful , and it &apos;s going to cost a mosquito bottle to be a mosquito bottle .
steve pinker showed us that we live in a very peaceful time in the world &apos;s time .
and according to charles cohen , the most violent thing that &apos;s been done in the last 130 years is 80 percent of the past 130 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations constantly .
in fact , we have redefined poverty .
remember that a large proportion of americans living under the poverty line , access to electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , tv , mobile phones , mobile phones , and cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the most powerful of the earth , would never have been able to have these luxury balloons .
the basis of a lot of these technologies are building technologies , and these are growing up .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that will become information technology on the line of moore &apos;s law , is big leaps , and the most prolific all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less and less than a supercomputer than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law &apos;s law .
notice two things that are on this curve .
first , as smooth you are -- in good ways , war or peace , recession , depression , and the media , depression and the media .
this is the result of faster computers , making faster computers .
it &apos;s slowing down for no one of our big problems .
and also , despite their logarithmic , they &apos;re on the left side .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to all of us .
&quot; the &quot; internet , &quot; which is my friends in autodesk called &quot; the sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers , the 3d printer that enable us to democratize the personal production of our planet , synthetic biology , the electrical , digital medicine , the electrical , digital medicine , the treatment and the gender .
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm supercomputer at the risk of the &quot; risk ? &quot;
that was great .
i &apos;ve been watching newspapers , and i &apos;ve been looking for the best headlines that i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson mcchrystal &apos;s human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that this artificial intelligence is available every owner of a football system .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i here at ted is a new university called singularity university .
we bring our students all these technologies , with special focus , and we &apos;re going to focus on how these can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students to create companies , products and services that can affect a decade positive of people can affect billions of people .
think about that , a group of students today can affect the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this was ridiculous .
today we can refer to dozens of companies that have done this .
if i think of a way to create abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating scarce surplus surplus surplus .
because scarcity is the economic force , and technology is a liberating force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of the karmapa in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of the king to dinner .
and the soldiers were getting the same , very repetitive , and they got a flood .
but the king of the king of the king was got a lot of time .
aluminum was at this time that the most valuable metal was on the planet , more valuable than gold and platinum .
this is why the dome of the ocean &apos;s being made from aluminum .
even though aluminum grier takes the percent of the world &apos;s population , it &apos;s not as pure as a mere metal .
it &apos;s going to connect by oxygen and water .
but then the technology was developed , and then made production so cheap that we use it with our own business system .
and then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we think today about the world .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet of the brain with more energy than we use a year .
16 percent of the energy is all 88 minutes on the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not an scarcity , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time , reducing the cost of solar energy in india 50 percent of the oil &apos;s disease -- in comparison to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent in the last year .
last month , this has published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the western areas of the united states of solar solar , in the united states , it will cost to 15 cents per capita .
and if we have a metabolic energy , we will also have water in the abundance .
let &apos;s talk about the brain .
do you remember , as carl sagan , the most powerful in 1990 , when it was the saturn , it turned back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it ?
&quot; a &quot; a &quot; blue dotcom shack . &quot;
because we live on a private level .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s the percent of water , two percent of the water , and we &apos;re fighting about 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new to the way that it &apos;s gone , the way it &apos;s going .
and from a conversation today with dean ornish , one of the innovators of doing it , i want to share something with you -- he gave me permission -- his favorite -- his favorite , the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; -- and the most of you have heard of it . it has the size of a football center in the field of the field .
it can produce thousands of clean drinking water a day from different sources of water -- whether water water , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less cents per gallon .
the president of coca-cola just has a big deal of the world , starting to start a hundred units in developing countries .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola will apply this technology globally in the world in the whole planet .
this is a transformative innovation that &apos;s now there .
and we &apos;ve also seen this in mobile phones .
you mean , you know , you know , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent of the mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 2013 .
just consider that a computer company with a cell phone in the middle of kenya has a better health system than president reagan has 25 years ago .
and if you look for your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowing and information than president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in the abundance of how nobody could have predict .
and it &apos;s better than that , which you and i spent for a couple thousand dollars -- gps , the computer and photograph , libraries of books and music , technology , and the technology , technology , technology , is literally becoming more inclusive and cheaper in your mobile phone .
and the best thing is , perhaps what &apos;s expected to do in health .
in the last month , i had the pleasure of the computer , which is the so-called &quot; $ 10 million &quot; prize prize prize .
we ask teams around the world , to connect all these technologies together in a mobile phone that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s equipped with ai , you can test it , or test your own brain .
and to win , the device has to make a better diagnosis than a team of doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country where there &apos;s no doctors , but 25 percent of the health care and 1.3 percent of health care .
if this device sequenced a computer or a computer company , which is not known , it &apos;s called the cancer system , and it prevents a pandemic from the outbreak of the outbreak of it .
but now the biggest force that &apos;s going to lead us to a world of excess .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the most sophisticated .
and by the way , the biggest most powerful , the biggest education , is a better education and nutrition in the world .
in 2010 , we had just been connected to two billion people online .
until 2020 , we &apos;re going to move the genome crisis from two billion internet users .
three billion new heads that we &apos;ve never heard before , the global communication will join .
what do these people need ?
what will they consume ? what will they want ?
and instead of economic gridlock , i see one of the greatest economic technology systems in history .
these people represent multiple dollars that will be flowing into global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier , and they &apos;re getting better trained by the most violent , and they &apos;re going to have the opportunity to be able to use 3d printers and &quot; the computing computing system , &quot; and be more productive than ever before .
so what can we do three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of the most violent of the world &apos;s population ?
as if it was with a sentence , it never has been known before .
how would it be , the oppressed where they are , to give a voice to be careful and create change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people going to bring ?
how about the online thing that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things i learned about the x prize is that small teams that are motivated by passion and focus are extraordinary things , things that could only be able to do the great business and governments in the past .
i want to close with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might already know .
it &apos;s a game that is foldit called foldit .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to develop .
and the way we can predict the structure and the function is to predict .
and this is very important in the world &apos;s office .
so far , this was a problem for supercomputer .
and this game was played by university professors .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people playing online the game online .
and it showed that the human pattern pattern is better than the ones that are the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked at who &apos;s the best of the world , this was not a business designer , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was an assistant at the day of the house in a prison , and at night the best most powerful of the world was the best ever in the world .
ladies and gentlemen , what i have in the vast of the vast confidence in our future is that we are more power than individuals to put us in the world of the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to the tools that we have with exponential technology .
we have the passion of a laser .
we have the capital of the world &apos;s capital .
and we have three billion new heads that we can work on online to master the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s needed .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something about a computer of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a medical doctor , and i think that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;m a long time in business , as i can allow it to give me a piece of my own wrong wrong thing to give this up .
but before i come to the actual topic of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re the most close and moving on the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; the &quot; cat &quot; appears soon , and it &apos;s about statistics and to use these great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to give you a statistic of that i hope most of you have heard about .
it &apos;s the most powerful of the water .
we talk about a 300 , if a bat beat 300 .
that means that the player is safe to beat three of 10 beats .
that &apos;s what &apos;s called the ball in the street , it &apos;s going to be , it &apos;s not going to be caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball to the first base , it didn &apos;t get done in time and the seat of the seat was in security .
three out of 10 .
do you know how to call a laser in a nanotube in the blink of the world ?
well , really good , maybe a more unfair .
do you know how to call a laser replacement ?
this is a person who &apos;s probably four of them in the rest of the world .
so , the ted writer -- the last ted committee -- the last ted survey of the baseball philharmonic player , was met by a foreign season over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , where i feel a lot more comfortable or maybe a little less likely to be talked about it .
imagine a computer of a computer and you &apos;ll be discharged to a very , very frustrating , which is the most frustrating 400 in terms of the brain .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine life in a certain remote area and you have a beloved person with clogged , and you have a very passionate person to a laser , which is a little bit of a sudden , in the field of innovation at 200 .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better . it &apos;s on the food branch .
and she &apos;s a little bit of a laser .
somehow , it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the most powerful or a nurse or a nurse or a nurse is a more powerful one ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody in the entire medicine knows what a good surgeon or doctor should be or a doctor .
but what we do is we &apos;re doing every one of them , including them , to be transported to the world with a complete claim .
never a mistake , no one makes it a question of the idea of how this should be done .
and that &apos;s the message i took in medical school .
i was a tactile scholar of graduate student .
in high school , a school meeting said that brian was going to learn for a blood test .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little little comic book in the sisters , in the south toronto hospital , in the south toronto .
i learned everything .
in my favorite business , i learned the origins and the tail every single branch of every branch of every branch , which is from the aorta , obscure and ordinary , ordinary and ordinary .
i even knew the most violent thing about the most violent of the plastic , to classify the u.s.
and i have more and more knowledge , and i have more knowledge .
and i was good , i was going to go out with a tour of the street .
and i left the medical school with the impression that i knew if i knew everything and knew anything , or at least as close as possible , so close to how possible i could do it with mistakes .
and it worked for a time until i met a woman &apos;s printer .
i &apos;m going to be in toronto here in a teaching teaching to me in the prison room in the hospital &apos;s office .
and at that point , i was being used to the most popular layer of the service .
and it was my mission when the most cosmopolitan was looked for the surgical advice .
and feedback to my favorite system .
i studied a woman &apos;s printer , and she was in a refugee .
and when i do your rent , she made a sound of sounds .
and when i was with the chest , i could hear a little bit of a sound , i could hear a little bit of a sound on both sides , which was told that she was suffering under the heart failure .
this is a state that &apos;s failed to pump the heart , instead of pump the entire blood on the lung , and it &apos;s a part of the blood muscle in the lung , and it &apos;s got to get the red one , so the most powerful one came .
and that was not hard to do with that .
i put them and made me care about the treatment .
i gave her an urge . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine , which we call water pills , water , so they &apos;re going to be able to tear the liquid .
and over a period of a half to two hours , she started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i was going to get my first mistake ; i sent them home .
i actually made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my favorite party .
i didn &apos;t take the reward , and i did what i would have been , what would have been a call in my lab phone , so that he had a chance to make a picture .
and he knew she would have been able to get more information in the situation .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the doctor &apos;s doctor .
i might be so successful and so on to take responsibility that i was so able to do that and i would be able to help my patients without having to pass it to it .
my second mistake was worse .
and so i sent them home , i &apos;m going to send a quiet voice in me , which i tried to say , &quot; goldman , no good idea . do not do that . &quot;
in fact , i was so obsessed with the fact that i asked the nurse to ask the nurse , which was a little bit of a magician , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay if you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it and said in the way , &quot; yeah , i think it will go all your way . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
so , i got a hurricane , and an ambulance and an ambulance and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day i had this nagging feeling in my stomach .
but i continued to work .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , and i went to the hospital and went to a parking lot to drive with the car , when i did something else .
i went home to my way home .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen the wife after ms. printer , but one of the three words that most of the words i know , and that three words are afraid of most of the time i know .
other medical doctors are also afraid , but the care of care is very , because we just see the patients as well .
the three words loud : remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient that she thought of home ? &quot;
the nurse was asking the mark mark .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular kind of space .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
about an hour after that , after i had sent her home , she collapsed and the family called holly . the family , they brought back back to the top of the blood pressure with 50 , which is a dangerous motivator .
they don &apos;t breathe and they were blue .
the most powerful thing was moving all the strands .
they gave her their own credit .
she was breaking them on the top of the world .
i was shocked and to the inside of the inner field .
and i went through this rollercoaster because she came to the intensive care industry , and i hoped that she was going to recover .
and after two , three days , they realized they would never be hacked again .
she didn &apos;t have a sweat in a total .
their family gathered together .
and in the course of the next eight or nine days , they found the most violent .
on the bottom of the day , she &apos;s going to go to her -- ms. printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say that you never forget the names of those who are never paying attention .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
the next weeks i gave myself , and i learned to be the first time myself , the unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt myself , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame you feel about , because you can &apos;t talk about the colleagues about it .
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret of the best friend , even though this one is going to be a little bit of a sudden and you get the best friend and you &apos;re going to have a terrible discussion , and you &apos;re going to have a very bad discussion , and you &apos;re going to do that , you know , never power to make it again .
if you do a lot of time , and you never make the mistakes again .
this is the kind of high-tech shame .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is that it &apos;s going to make a clean .
it &apos;s the one who says that it &apos;s not what you did , but you &apos;re bad , you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t for my favorite , he was very dear .
he talked to the family and i &apos;m sure he was the frontal lobes , and sure i was not sued .
but i was asking myself that questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the ted card ? why would i send them home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a dumb mistake ?
why did i go to medicine ?
slowly , it &apos;s safe .
i started feeling better .
and then on a very high day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun broke up and i could feel myself , maybe i could feel better again .
and i was out of my own time , if i had doubled my efforts to perfection , and never again would take a mistake to the voice .
and she did .
and i continued to work .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the prison hospital in a hospital hospital in a hospital , north of toronto and i rented a 25 years old man with a young man .
it was a lot of applause and i was in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked in the kitchen and it was a little pink .
and i gave him an prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and then , when he went out of the door , he showed his shoulder .
two days later , i came to my next day , and my favorite coach asked me to go on a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the most violent ? &quot;
it turns out he was a viewing machine .
he had a potentially a false disease called the &quot; abegg disease . &quot;
you can google this , but it &apos;s not infection of the top of the internet , but the top of the body is causing the beating and causes the top of the body .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got a little bit of a time , and he recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same kind of magic of shame and self-doubt , and i felt it was made , and went to work to work and again and again .
in a more unusual , i &apos;ve missed two times a little bit of a sudden .
there &apos;s a lot of it that &apos;s been heard , especially if you think about it in a hospital that only had 14 patients per night .
i didn &apos;t send them home in both cases and there was no alarm in their treatment .
i thought he would have been a little bit more friendly .
i &apos;m going to see the x-ray of the kidneys , and when it was without a computer scientist , my colleague was stuck with the patient &apos;s favorite party in the bottom right , and the surgeons were calling .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i &apos;m going to go to the ted lab to try and tell my colleagues to be able to report him .
and he did , and he was thinking , as he was going to be a real lower sector , he called the surgeons .
in both cases , it was a little bit of time , and it was good .
both cases of mine , i &apos;m on , i &apos;m on top .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues , but total nonsense .
some of my favorite classes happened in the last five years .
and it &apos;s been embarrassed by the support of the body alone .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t close with my mistakes and talk about them , if i can tell you what &apos;s really happening to me , what did not happen to me , how can i be able to share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
if i had a room -- like now , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking about me .
when did you hear that last time from somebody who talked about the most violent about the internet of the brain ?
oh yes , you go to a cocktail party and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about your own mistakes .
if i had a full one of a room with colleagues and asked them to share their immediate support and to tell them what i just told you , i would not be able to get the end of the second story , before it really would be uncomfortable , and i would make the point and forget the rest .
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues that a hospital company would have lost the wrong leg , you would think i would have trouble looking at him in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system we live in .
it &apos;s a totally denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system that is in the two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do . those who don &apos;t have to do that , those who survived sleep and the ones that are doing the sleep with bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological reaction as antibodies that attack people .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we do the ones that make mistakes from medicine , we have a safe system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of medical health , and journalism , i have a personal medical study about medical errors and wrong treatments to make everything for me for the first article i think of toronto star , black , black species , black species , written .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely valid .
we &apos;re working in a system that every day , in which one of 10 percent of the brain is either a false or wrong , and the more , the labor , and the more problematic , and the destruction are being dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians die of the mistakes .
in the united states , the institute are listed for medicine .
both of these are strong , because we don &apos;t think about the problem that we should .
and is the most powerful thing .
in a more competitive case that all the medical knowledge is doubling , we can &apos;t keep up .
sleep is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error , so we can take a perfect health model for a patient with chest chest .
then i take the same patient with a computer , making it a little bit more powerful and more , and give it a little bit of a breath and a little bit of a sudden , and suddenly the story is flooded with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same line .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i &apos;m not always doing things .
and my patients are not cars ; they tell me that they don &apos;t always tell me the symptoms .
all of that is inevitable .
so if you take the system like that , i &apos;ve been taught , and all of the time that i &apos;ve been taught , and all of the time all the time that i &apos;ve been taught , is not going to be left .
and you know the most important thing about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white &quot; , black kind of thing i have to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake to everyone from the most violent to the ted floor , &quot; this is my worst mistake , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , which is what it is . &quot;
and then their pupils expand , they &apos;ve come out of the head , and they &apos;re looking down and eating it , and they start to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
you want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistakes i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what you need is a environment that you can do in the situation .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new , very , very , defined by a human being , knows to his humanity , it &apos;s not proud to make sure that it &apos;s not proud to make sure , but it &apos;s going to be seen by them , so it can be passed out .
it shares your experience with other people .
they &apos;re supporting the other mistakes .
and it shows other people &apos;s mistakes , not about the more of the things , but in a nurturing , supportive way of all of them .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes people fill the system with life and when that is , then people make mistakes of time .
so that the system evolved to create the way that it makes a little bit easier to find out that people will make and make it more friendly , supporting spaces that are going to be observed and also to be able to be able to be able to be able to do that , and that &apos;s what the potential of the health care is to be able to do and be focused on the most important of these .
my name is brian goldman .
i &apos;m the new doctor , i &apos;m redefining .
i &apos;m a human . i &apos;m making mistakes .
but i &apos;m busy , but i &apos;m trying to do best to learn from the way to make it different .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding from me , but i can live with it .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny little little idea .
it &apos;s about the most violent thing .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories before , to use time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was in 1974 here .
they think he &apos;s selling the police , but it &apos;s not true .
actually , he lived fish .
he described one of them as a very , &quot; usually . &quot;
it was a business of a business .
until the &apos; 80s , he was covered in great style .
now he &apos;s the following list of the emerging list .
this story is a lot of times from the galapagos , or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet we still come to the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the main line is still called the pristine .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is to give a different concept , the most powerful , the most powerful thing .
because i &apos;ve experienced it when i studied a lagoon in a nazi backyard .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a bad indoor indoor credit , and i was convinced that i really wasn &apos;t there .
it was my first indoor foil .
as you can see , the lagoon of palms and a few mangroves were carved apart .
there was a little bit of the three inches of about 20 inches , a little prisoner &apos;s cube .
the fisheries of these twin workers were very productive and the fishermen lived well and made a lot of good in ghana above all of the time .
when i returned 27 years later , the fish had wiped out half of his size .
and it &apos;s a year of a year .
they were genetically modified .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had the happiness , even there .
so it &apos;s nothing changed , and yet it has changed everything .
my third little story shares my favorite story at the introduction of the most powerful in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- more at the 60s -- the north of the 1960s -- a lot of the internet engineers .
the other thing that happened was that the country that had 100 fish started to get the industrial fishing out of this kind of ugly ship .
i went to it and we did the whole southern sea of the ocean and particularly in the northern sea .
we had no words for what we started there .
i know that it was the bottom of the ocean .
90 percent of our main species were sponges , other animals , who are connected to the reason .
the largest part of the fish , the little dots there on the rubble , the most cosmopolitan , were the most cosmopolitan .
basically the bottom of the ocean came up and then it was thrown down .
these images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast .
within a year , you have a survey , and then you start with the basics of fishing .
the reason is , it &apos;s going to change . it &apos;s a hard reason , or a soft coral , and the soft moon is going to be a bit of crap .
this is a dead turtle .
they were not eaten , you threw them away , because they were dead .
once we started a living alive .
she wasn &apos;t drowning .
then they wanted to kill them because they could eat them well .
in fact , this mountain is covered by the oyster every time they &apos;re going to live in areas where they &apos;re never born .
it &apos;s not going to record .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we fit our new levels of the new level and we don &apos;t get to feel like what was there .
if you put it on , what happens .
on the y-axis , a few good things are , biodiversity , number of the world &apos;s green , green of the green , the green .
it &apos;s changing . it changes because for people , their actions are all their actions .
every generation looks at the images that they &apos;re facing at the beginning of their conscious life as a standard and becomes all of it .
the difference is that it &apos;s a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
there &apos;s a order of change .
and at the end , they want to get the most popular remains .
that &apos;s largely our goal now .
we want to get things that are gone , or things that are not more like that , how they were .
you might think that the problem was that the problem was that the problem that you were certainly living in the societies were killing animals , and that only after a few generations , what they did was that they had done what they did .
because obviously , an animal that was very often made , just once it was , rarely , before it &apos;s got a lot of time .
so you don &apos;t often lose animals .
you lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not a big loss .
we &apos;re focusing on the big animals and the sea , and the big fish are the big fish .
they &apos;re getting less likely because we start .
and with time , there &apos;s a little fish left , and we think that &apos;s the most powerful .
the question is why people accept that .
well , because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , confirm that it was really different .
they will confirm it because the evidence , as they &apos;re in a previous form , are not like the evidence of the evidence .
for example , there are the anecdote that the report of a football project , which looked at great amounts of music , can &apos;t be used , or by the time of the sun , not being used to be a scientific , not being a scientific .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , although we live in educated societies because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous big role that can play a marine chamber .
because in the marine environment , we basically put the past back .
we &apos;re going to put the past back to the people who can &apos;t understand because the most powerful changes , and very low .
so the people who see a marine marine zone and benefit from the insight that allows you to reset your energy .
what about people who are not possible to have the people who are not possible -- the people in the middle west to ask for example ?
here , i think , the art and the film may be the gap , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was a lot of time -- 500 years ago .
and the most important and a half of the time you may remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were so touched by this -- except from the most violent , why were they so touched by the most violent ?
because it &apos;s something that has lost in a way that &apos;s lost in a way .
so my first one , the only one i &apos;m going to do is point to cameron ii , so he &apos;s going to go under water .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist francisco , you had to , if you had a typewriter , you had to lift this up at the government .
they also had to tap a sheet of a sheet of dna from that typewriter .
the reason for this : the government could track up where a text came from .
they found a paper with a computer company , they could track the creator of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do something like that , and how much the freedom of speech would be driven .
in our own countries , we would never do something like that .
but if you &apos;re going to buy a new video of 2011 , you get a new version of the leading internet of the world &apos;s leading and print a page , and then this page is bright yellow on every page , in a pattern that makes the page clear and your printer make it .
that &apos;s what happens today .
and nobody seems to be a little bit of a plastic .
and that was an example of what our own governments are doing , the technology , to use the citizens .
and this is one of the three main technologies that are now in the existing world today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening on the world : we can divide the attacks in categories .
we have three main systems .
there are a lot of wood .
for example , this is mr. reed &apos;s favorite designer from the wooden in ukraine .
and the motives of the brain are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use the same to make a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several known cases of the u.s. , the more powerful , which made their money through attacks .
this is a huge video of plastic in estonia .
this is alfred &apos;s .
stephen watt .
the computer &apos;s favorite team .
these are matthew anderson , and the most so on and so on and so on .
these people have come online to wealth , but they have been organized by the way they used the horses to make money from our bank bank , while we do our online online , or we have a team of online , and we &apos;ve been using our online team online , while we &apos;re going to go online through a infected computer online .
the u.s. intelligence agency , two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam otwoma here , and on this account were secondary million dollars , as it &apos;s frozen .
mr. jain himself is on free feet , the eardrum is unknown .
and i &apos;m saying that today it &apos;s more likely to be victims of a design of a war than an animation in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just going to be worse .
in the future , most of the crimes are going to play online .
the second largest whale system that we see today are not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , a sense , or their audience .
groups like anonymous are over the last 12 months , and they &apos;re in one of the most profound places that we have on the field of the field .
so these are the three main principles : criminals that do it because of the money , they do it , they &apos;re doing the things that are causing resistance , but the last group are nations , governments who lead the attacks .
there &apos;s a time from the world of the world .
it shows a great thing what happens when governments are doing their own citizens .
and the apple &apos;s office is a key from the netherlands -- or it was .
in the last fall , it had to blow up , because it was hacked .
somebody was hacked and had a very hard hacked system .
and last week in a meeting with dutch , i hired one of the senior senior students who had the question of whether he had been able to get the same thing for the most powerful people .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying of such a bioluminescent water cell ?
so , the computer &apos;s office is a key .
they sell them to the rescue .
what do you do with the pop-up revolution ?
now , a certificate you need , if you have a website with a surface of the service , with a little , you know , xml .
now we all use , or many of us , preferably or a of their competitors , but these services are particularly common in southern states like iran , where they &apos;re using the , they can &apos;t use the same confidence as local players and that they can &apos;t be able to be able to hold the government in their conversation .
but if you can go in a foreign foreign .
and marketing is called the fake , fake design .
and that &apos;s what happens in the case of the brain .
how does it affect the arab spring and the things that are happening for example in egypt ?
now , in egypt , the easter archives in april atala , the headquarters in the egyptian , the headquarters , and they found a lot of records .
in these records , a folder was called &quot; the &quot; eureka . &quot;
and in this folder , notes were in germany of a local company that had sold a few programs that had a few programs that they had -- in very large frame -- no communication of egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for utah , and they had sold this program .
the most important thing is right here .
so western governments supply vitality with the government , so that they can deliver their own citizens to be able to do it .
but western governments also help themselves .
for example , in germany , a few weeks ago , the so-called so-called the so-called film book was found a horse that was used by german to be used to get their own citizens .
if you &apos;re in a training store , you &apos;re going to be using a lot of your phone to be abused with your phone .
but today we are far beyond that .
they tap their internet internet .
they use tools like the most cosmopolitan , to make their computers with a mosquito tube , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their most , their own communication , their wallets .
so if we think about these things , the obvious answer is the people : &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not for me because i &apos;m a good citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i don &apos;t have anything to hide . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we now , in 2011 , our governments are thinking about trust is , but every right that we &apos;re going to be being emitted for forever .
and trust , we trust a person &apos;s own government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to do with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the computer of automobile .
the first of the first is made spears and the very simple idea of a simple idea : modules made from cement with a set of measurements that fit .
and the very quickly is very quickly the most powerful , the most powerful of the world .
they put us in the situation , making things bigger than we , building bridges , a rock after the other .
essentially , the most primitive thing was that we had the building system of our time .
almost a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego came out of these .
it was called the &quot; automatically scientific stone . &quot;
and within a few years , lego in every household moved .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion rocks were produced -- or 75 stones for each person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it for all possible .
lego has basically the most powerful , the building building , and it &apos;s made of a building block for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the same year , the next year in the bell labs , the next year .
the transistor was a little bit of a plastic , which was a world of static , building blocks to a world in which everything was interactive .
how the world &apos;s favorite solution allows us to build a transistor much more complex , more complex set of light , a stone after the other .
but there &apos;s a more powerful thing : the transistor was only for experts .
personally , i don &apos;t accept that , that the building block of our time is informed to experts , and so i decided to change .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started exploring this idea of how to put the engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing a lot of time .
let me show you how they work .
and the power of the game is electronic modules that have a specific function .
they &apos;re a little bit of light , light , tone , engine and sensor .
and the best thing about this is that they connect with magnets .
you can &apos;t put them around the ground .
the stones are the ones .
green is a copy , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange is wires .
so everything you need to do is connect a blue and a green one , and build it very quickly , and build it very quickly .
they add a blue one to a green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch in between and so you &apos;ve created a little bit of a plastic loop .
take the switch out of a little bit , which is , you cut it , you cut it , and you &apos;ve made a little bit of a plastic stick .
add this to a more , and they have a more useful effect , and they &apos;ve made a more powerful one .
i &apos;ll stop that .
and the simple thing beyond that is , actually , a pretty powerful thing is really powerful .
instead of programming , you have to program , or you have to program , or you have to get a little bit of time to code , intuitive gestures .
so to accelerate the flashing ones , or slow down , just turn it on this button , and it &apos;s going to make the momentum faster or slow .
the idea behind the surface is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world in a more productive stone .
lights , sound , the piano , motors , motors -- everything should be available .
we have a lot of people distributed and you see them playing with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how they start to understand electronics that they &apos;re in the everyday world and they don &apos;t learn to learn in school .
like a computer company , or why the doors of the internet &apos;s office , or how a ipod respond to touch .
we also brought up to the wild system .
so , for example , we had no experience with no experience in electronic things that started playing with the material .
here we see , with the computer , paper and water bottles , like the internet vessels ...
a few weeks ago we got a little bit of time to risd and gave them some designers that had no technical experience -- just box , wood and paper -- and they told them , &quot; do what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that you did , a computer of the computer .
but wait , this is really my favorite story .
it &apos;s a hummer from play-doh , fear in the darkness .
for this particular period , the computer was another material , electronics was just another material .
and we want to make this material for all available .
so , the open source is open source .
you can go to the website , download all the most , the download and make it yourself .
we want the world of creators , the inventor , the contributors , because the world , where we live , these interactive world , we &apos;re hearing .
so , pull out and start to invent .
thank you .
