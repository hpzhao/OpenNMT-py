there &apos;s something little that react to it .
it should attack the hunters of the computer .
one way to draw a picture is to draw a picture .
if we resolve the double double spots in their two strands , they see that these things like teeth look like teeth .

and if you said , we gave them a new one . and while they have this kind of carbon , we have the other thing that they &apos;ve just built , again .
there was a very nice relationship between the love of legos and the number of the wind legos .
and i think the ceo of the world is basically not understood how important it is .

it could definitely be made of people here from the audience .
for example , by 350 years ago , if we had a chance to have a chance to have the education of the military , we &apos;d talked about the massive innovation of the military , about the massive computer of stability , and we could have been predicting an
now , in this environment where you don &apos;t know whether the potential enemy is prepared on defense or attack , and whether the weapons are driving the attack , this environment is what most of the things that are going on is to be a conflict .

just because there &apos;s a certain sense of meaning , or if you &apos;re a lot of involved in the way that wikipedia , ) a particular sentence .
i have no slides , so you &apos;ll have to be able to get to me with it .
a study of the world &apos;s media has shown that there &apos;s a clear thing to be in 28 african countries .
the state should not be involved in production and services , because it &apos;s inefficient and rodents , and it &apos;s on this area .
but what it pushed immediately , the way that we had dominated our economic development -- that means that if oil prices were high , our economy grew very fast .
the same thing we do in the field of ice .
and otherwise i wish i wanted you to see this .
he called it , &quot; massive fatal , &quot; which means that they could kill up to 100 million people in the next 50 years .
until recently , we didn &apos;t know how a vaccine was doing exactly .
the main challenge for these two viruses is that they &apos;re constantly changing .
these drugs are not cure , but they &apos;re going to give a huge triumph of science because they &apos;re at least the automated death sentence of a computer that &apos;s at least for them .
but you know , the research that has occurred to hiv has helped us with the progress of other diseases .
this was a slow process , which was a blood &apos;s process of chicken eggs , millions of living chicken eggs .
and in the way , in the radically more radical production and the vast microwave process of e. coli , for example , i &apos;ve just talked about -- look at the iron time -- that would be the world &apos;s water .
so the challenge is to predict full power .
the question is , why ?
do you think african union is being organized in such a conference ?
there are some things that you need to know .
the speaker who was here on the stage was , in the stage , mohamed , pointed out that we had the leader of leadership in africa .
by suffering it from your suffering .
traditionally , africans hate governments -- they hate tyranny .
they decide what they do .
he &apos;s not getting help from government , and he &apos;s building a second bigger boat .
something that would connect all of us together .
scott &apos;s results were full of it .
and the challenge for algorithmic filter , these personalized filters , is that they &apos;re the result of that balance because they &apos;re going to go to the point of what you click on .
it &apos;s going to be a new set of ideas , and we have to do new people and strangers .
and the man said , &quot; well , pretty much home , what ? &quot;
i know that you &apos;re waiting for more bad news -- i &apos;m just kidding -- but now , just a quick repetition of repetition and then i &apos;ll show you a little bit of a little bit of material .
until the most responsible , it will be a stimulus on a version 2.0 , which you can get to the purchase of the steel .
even again , all the republican here , it &apos;s not supposed to go to the ground .
what really impressed me about the gulf of the gulf is that they &apos;re the most prolific .
and there &apos;s no one that &apos;s trying to do any more , except a few people who are trying to use the beach .
we heard that bacteria eat oil ?
this is the ocean swim across the ocean .
when the japanese pearl harbor was taken , at least they were going back .
what the breast cancer is like is not to do a lot of anger , i don &apos;t want to do a lot of people who clean birds .
okay , people who are conservative when they really wanted to be really conservative and really , really , they should be put in the company to send them to the food industry .
it &apos;s about right and wrong .
and i developed a system to produce medical isotopes .
okay , i &apos;m more than my genes -- all together .
i didn &apos;t mention you to the ground because it &apos;s true , but to remember you .
they contain a molecule that we know as a brain epidemic .
and that &apos;s just a single one . it &apos;s a lot smaller than a human being .
now , neurons , as well as trees , can grow new branches and lose old branches .
and we can even talk about the most powerful .
if you &apos;re to celebrate these numbers , you can get a little bit of a big idea that there &apos;s a big potential for the brain .
maybe this technique is going to be able to know that we know ourselves from moving and gathering our own brain .
he &apos;s basically working on music videos and ads with his company , the most populous .
so we &apos;ve prepared a quick experiment here to show you this .
ks : no , not .
while he did , he noticed a unexpected thing .
ks : so , there &apos;s a matrix of the internet &apos;s surface .
ridiculous , right ?
and a few months ago , i sent a friend to this guy , eduardo sousa .
a huge scandal for a few weeks .
but he still did .
so his farm is incredible .
and then he found these wild plants , the most prolific .
and then they fly in the circle .
i finally came to try to try and try and do it before i went .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
what on hell does this mean ?
at least , i think it &apos;s supposedly .
farmers who rely on nature to find solutions , instead of nature , to solve solutions , rather than nature &apos;s solutions .
and the old one to change the new fire is to change two big stories about oil and electricity , which are both the two fifth of the fossil field in the air .
our fuel for mobility is three to three cars .
you can make it quiet , it &apos;s tougher than titan .
trucks and planes can use realistic hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
even better light and the more powerful and so forth , the peak of the surface is a third of the surface .
in about 20 years , private food consumption has been more cheap solar cells without financial losses on their roofs and lower their energy systems .
and what we &apos;re also replacing is it will be about the same cost : about six trillion dollars in play games -- although we buy more of it , what we have or new nuclear and so-called energy , or renewable , or renewable , or more centralized .
so , on results , and not incentives , to focus , can be more competitive and conflict to the solution of america &apos;s solution .
later , i realized that what i had eaten , two of his family was true .
this simple kind of light show that donor donors , where the least kids go to school , don &apos;t have funded schools . this raises new questions . aid , the ones that you need most ?
two years ago , at april eight , i called my father .
i &apos;m not trying to design the toothbrush .
we remember and can look at this in every book of my favorite son , that life was formed four billion years ago -- four billion point of point ?
so , i &apos;m not sure i &apos;m sure .
there are risks , there are . one trap : the vertical .
you have time to think of it , and you have time to talk about art and things like that .
you go back to the future , back , back , back , back .
they come from families where they &apos;re mostly one person at home , mostly the mother or grandmother , and they come for their education and their structure here .
we &apos;re bringing them to the right and left to the left , so they can follow and know the consequences , if they &apos;re hitting orders .
let &apos;s go online all the time . &quot;
it &apos;s defining .
they said , &quot; it &apos;s enough for the long-term system .
you can support us . that &apos;s the task of you guys . &quot;
but i have to have my hot name .
you can listen and join .
let &apos;s take the example of the world &apos;s population .
if you think about wikipedia , you &apos;re looking at any content in the content , and you have the largest encyclopedia of the world .
there are many people who have the same dream .
a website was made .
there was no leader .
extremism has become tolerance .
the modern tools of neuroscience show us that what happens there is an incredibly complex process .
we can keep up loud of our own language , but not the stranger .
we checked this by watching american babies who had never heard a second language at the beginning of the critical phase of the moment .
it may look like a computer system from mars .
science on one side has a very rational approach to their environment , as art is usually a emotional approach to its environment .
now i have a live place over here to show you this .
let me demonstrate this over here .
the dalai lama once said , &quot; love and compassion are the most popular .
the canvas were hunted by a little girl whose body was burned off .
it &apos;s part of every human being .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we choose to do compassion ?
the wound over maggots .
suppose you like squares , and honestly , who doesn &apos;t like them ?
we start with a computer system and then we &apos;re going to take another kind of carbon approach .
then , there was a riot that was a lot more exciting , a computer company .
i am like , &quot; he &apos;s already dead .
&quot; did i do what was going on ! &quot; &quot; i have no a snack . what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what do you do here ? &quot;
so i went into the lobby and saw this indian guy .
marco tempest : when you asked him to ask him , he said , &quot; magic is the only thing that &apos;s going on .
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to demonstrate to you how closely terrorism is connected to our daily lives .
at the time i interviewed the red brigades , i also discovered that their life was not defined by ideology and politics , but of economic constraints .
i think many people thought i was a little bit of a little bit of a computer .
but especially they got in serious terms of the organized crime .
this money was in a field of water and the most responsible -- in bar , understanding itself .
nobody wants the most responsible to control his own histories and set his own leg with customers .
some of you may think , &quot; wait time . you don &apos;t necessarily see how a baby &apos;s worth of view .
clearly , i wanted to leave my favorite , but what i didn &apos;t have seen was that it &apos;s an unexpected extreme , to leave his computer care .
and i really learned that , the bigger the challenge , the bigger the feeling of a special performance , if you get to the end .
well , i thought the atlantic was big , but the pacific is really very large .
but that didn &apos;t go without any more inclusive .
it &apos;s this little green disk on the horizon , which is what they do very nervous because of the rising sea level .
we can start to make better , more powerful , more sustainable decisions .
and so , the savage savage : why i &apos;m going to go through the pacific
this is the world trade center on the cover .
why ? why ? why do you want to do that ?
he doesn &apos;t see any organs . he doesn &apos;t use any extra time .
they were able to make it .
and finally , it &apos;s about comfort , it &apos;s about that you feel good about places that you didn &apos;t have good at all .
and that &apos;s hard when you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i asked myself , how can it be so easy to give up my dreams ?
it &apos;s not so hard , someone &apos;s favorite , and one day before school , i said , &quot; well , you can clone my homework , &quot; and i gave him the wrong answers that i had written in the night .
we both put in the back benches in the class , so we wouldn &apos;t be able to spoil with the other people .
maybe you brought your credit and you &apos;ve brought your teeth , and you never told you , because how can you say you , if all of you are buried in your wake ?
this is french science .
well , go ahead .
if you look at this truck , it &apos;s the largest truck of his way on earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the largest and the fastest growing of co2 in canada , and it &apos;s also the reason why canada is now three in terms of the average per capita .
and as a father , i can &apos;t imagine what a soul is doing .
by doing that , we remove a big part of our biggest industrial and replacing it with most greenhouse gases in the future .
the most powerful of her work is the courage to buy in every store and the millions of indian women every day on her forehead . it &apos;s a ritual , which is closely related to the institution of marriage .
so , in the blink of a hurry , we were born in a very born , in the toughness , and in london , they trained .
i hope you can convince you that complex and complicated is not always the same thing .
the most powerful thing is that the one we &apos;re going to affect -- the public support for government .
so i proposed in my first tedtalk that we should spend 21 billion hours a week with video games a week .
only 30 minutes of a day was a great improvement for a great improvement of mood and the pleasure of joy .
why a game ?
how could such a big effect like this could be a huge effect in so serious , sometimes there are situations in the serious , and sometimes they have situations ?
there are four ways of strength , or resilience that makes resilience to post-traumatic growth , and there are scientifically things that you can do every day to build this resilience , you don &apos;t need trauma .
more exercise is being empowered .
here &apos;s another secret for you : if you shake someone &apos;s hand , the baby &apos;s body will increase strong , and the most powerful thing is that it &apos;s going to increase the &quot; the &quot; s . &quot;
and in this project , we actually have hundreds of people around the world , and we &apos;re doing it with us , and actually , thousands of people are involved in this project , many of his different aspects of this project .
and then some people came from chicago and said , &quot; end of 2007 is the slogan of the chicago festival festival , and we have a cement of great gallery , and we want to say that they put them with their reef . &quot;
wool and the other things are not just two concepts that fit good .
pamela asked : &quot; how can i define parallel lines ? &quot;
infinitely . she recorded . it &apos;s very accurate .
so we have the wool , and we have a domestic control , the evidence that the most famous thing of mathematics is wrong .
and their individual ideas , and their employment with this mathematical method .
this particular recursive property -- the self -- is my belief , is the holy grail of neuroscience , neuroscience , and eventually we &apos;ll hopefully understand what &apos;s going on .
this person is otherwise at statistically clear minds and intelligent , but when he sees his mother , he &apos;s going to take his delusion and he says it &apos;s not his mother .
so if this area is damaged , you lose the ability to recognize faces .
tables and chairs and bankers -- nothing happens as usual , as i &apos;m now showing him a picture of his mother , and i &apos;ll show you the most low activity .
he knows that his arm is not there . nonetheless it &apos;s a compelling , more powerful experience .
maybe you can get the most powerful , the darkest in the phantom .
and my pain are gone . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , the last three days i didn &apos;t have a phantom and therefore no more in the elbow , no opiates , no adequate , no , a fan of the arm . all my pain are gone .
the blue is blue , forgiveness is green , another sound could be yellow .
that &apos;s the key .
which is kiki , which is is buba ?
you &apos;re a little bit more skeptical , which most of us don &apos;t deal with .
that &apos;s kanzi .
none of the things you &apos;re going to see in this video are the most ambiguous .
well done .
he has learned that he can do when he uses hands with his specific health team , much larger and more powerful , and more powerful .
a framework means a hut in the forest .
he looks like the sound comes from ?
because we believe it &apos;s not the biology , but the culture .
and some stars die in spectacular explosions that leave these remains .
on the right , gravity is the gravity . einstein has explained this .
and it &apos;s going to bring it out of new ways of changing the change .
it was too early to the early , but he was a moral guide , an inspiration for scientists who were concerned about the control of the guns .
let &apos;s have seen aliens living in our own place from far outside the cosmos , not only 40 years , but the whole four four years of the earth &apos;s total age .
martin rees asks this to be our last century ?
and it &apos;s even worse : &quot; then i would make a picture of it and make a dozen of a dozen .
well , these are students , so they gave a lot of money to things like earrings and makeup .
and then we asked them to go back , like happy .
but enormously different incentives .
these are the most populous in belgium .
the teams that we gave money to spend it for each other , were to other teams and struggle at the end of the league .
if we hear about the most recent , from the high levels of food , often we think that this is one of these most powerful conflict of the middle east , the roots of the middle east , the roots of itself .
ironically , it was a time when the most iran &apos;s climate was used to washington , and not the destruction of israel .
this is an analogy that is demanding to stop that diplomacy will stop , is rid of diplomacy , is inevitable .
you can look at certain kinds of energy , or you can look at the different regions and compare them .
the map of port is not going to be so good at the end of 2009 , not as well as you could have , not as good as the map of california .
the trick is .
and they said , &quot; he was not a environmentalists . &quot;
this system wants to take the status quo , even the status quo of a government &apos;s government .
so it &apos;s not about my theme that is the most important thing . it &apos;s not .
we can &apos;t do anything . &quot;
lawrence lessig : we , the citizens , have to return the republic
for example , some people in this room will be sputnik with a scholarship to school .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m on my pen . &quot;
everybody is just a little bit wrong .
i don &apos;t want to say that the law of entropy is not true , it &apos;s true .
here &apos;s the model of the computer attack .
if you &apos;re in north america , the ones that are so much active in the united states is the same thing , they ignore each other .
each of your favorite points depends on this critical region , which is the most important , which has about 10,000 of the independent cells , which each of the superficial , which has any clustering , has a very high tension , a low tension , a low way
they were a while in sync , and then apart .
so i want to first show you a few interviews with people who were opening up on the bridge , and describe what happened .
now , you don &apos;t normally hold yourself for a metronome , but we &apos;re all running -- we &apos;re going back to the run .
im : so , this weighs just a few tons , so it &apos;s going to go right .
it &apos;s the most powerful scientist in his area .
i didn &apos;t say what the list was , but she was in a medical order , and i told you , you should look for your name , your favorite , or your mother &apos;s names .
also , perhaps this fowler or maybe a more powerful , which is not worth economic behavior , an resilience against disease or pests or any other property that is useful for climate change , and the other ones don &apos;t have .
we &apos;re going to see children in tv .
the idea with svalbard was that there &apos;s cold , so you have natural temperatures underneath freezing .
and if anything happens , you can come and pick it up .
thank you .
look at your body relationships ! this is not right .
maybe any lady , a lady ? thank you very much .
you &apos;ve only tried two concepts -- two in the united states , and one in the russians .
madness ! i have to talk about innovation innovation -- the things that are developing , there &apos;s a lot of activity , and then you will be replaced by something else and die .
i can &apos;t tell you when it &apos;s going to go , because i don &apos;t want the competition to know my schedule .
i mean something really interesting that &apos;s going to happen here .
ok , let &apos;s talk about the commercial development of human life .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a few years , he &apos;s ready to give up , but one day he has a epiphany .
institutions are going to be naked , and if you &apos;re naked , it &apos;s the consequences .
the fourth meaning of openness and the fourth principle is the most powerful thing .
the apollo is from the u.s.
you know that bees and fish live in college .
all around us , a medical revolution is going to be a revolution that will help us defeat some of the worst diseases of our society , cancer with including .
this is a tumor , dark , gray , a tactile mass , a brain , in a brain .
and you can see that the ring of blood &apos;s blood &apos;s blood is gone .
but the real question is : how good do these things work in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add a nuclear record . it prevents angiogenesis to very effective ways .
but even more interesting , the study is that the men who have developed the most powerful , so the ones that have more tomato sauce , they have the more blood system , they have fed their cancer .
albert von king said , &quot; discoveries are to see what all of you have seen , and think of what nobody has thought . &quot;
i &apos;m a computer designer in discover magazine .
it has to be fun , unlike everyday problems , which are not really designed to be a very good set of puzzles .
this is the background of the other .
you can &apos;t do that physically , but it &apos;s going to be a computer . it &apos;s over to the computer .
i wanted to make a sequel .
what direction is that going to be ?
so there are games like &quot; brain age , &quot; a computer company .
looks like a black character . where is this ?
i really think that a girl is so powerful , so powerful is that we had to train all of them .
i remember , for example , my father , who was very , very violent , was struck me .
we &apos;re so used to stealing girls of the perspective , to be the fact that we &apos;re actually doing it to objects and they were in the way that they were in the process .
and she looked at the baby &apos;s eyes and she said , &quot; of course i love my baby . how could i love my baby ?
when we were there , she did a ritual , where she &apos;s the girl who fled her families , who were the adjacent family .
and i &apos;m going to be on your side of your life . &quot;
i love that i don &apos;t take the things easy .
why should you be stuck to me , you want to be more restrained ?
so , in the actual process , all six teenagers were saying , and the most responsible , the most successful they had made by the photo array .
but the incident was in the middle of january , on the northern hemisphere , to get seven o &apos;clock at night .
that &apos;s 10 feet away .
and what does this example of -- what is important to keep us in memory ?
he was a very religious man .
i got a year and traveled through africa , where i asked people why they were building fractals , which is a great job when you can get it .
and that &apos;s what it does in some villages farther down to the smallest level .
it &apos;s not really mathematical knowledge .
he said , &quot; if i lived in the jungle , i would just use a long time , because it &apos;s very fast and it &apos;s very cheap .
and just odd , odd .
we have a computer system in ghana .
but the bad news is .
instead of applying friends or relatives , they looked at david &apos;s workplace .
today , agile development is applied in a hundred countries , and it &apos;s enough to go up to the top of the road .
fear of being lost . beds .
we &apos;re going to make a couple of rules and hold them on them .
the conversation will run better . &quot;
now , as i &apos;m going to go to the day tonight to come here , one of my daughters started to get a child .
and we developed 10 .
i was a teenager when i first read &quot; anna &apos;s fry &quot; and the famous first sentence : &quot; all happy families alike .
i want to show you how to look at something so beautiful .
if i &apos;ve been born here in the water , you see a silver ball , and this is the most powerful , the water that keeps the water from the bottom of the ocean . it &apos;s dry .
and plato with all the young boys in his cave . sweeney : the ...
i &apos;m going to show you .
but tesla &apos;s success wasn &apos;t about the duration .
one thing i want to be very clear is that not all the neurosurgeon have been wearing the same neurosurgeon .
we can get them out or turn it down , and it &apos;s on or turn it out .
he &apos;s one of five children .
i showed you that we can apply it to the circuits of the mood in the cases of depression .
we &apos;re to understand what these circuits are and what the brain regions are responsible for the clinical signs and symptoms of those diseases .
evolution is actually working in a little bit like a hot engineer than a bug .
that &apos;s enough !
what we discovered is if you look at the leg of a human being like richard , or a cockroach or a kangaroo or a kangaroo , the relative of these feather is equal to all that we &apos;ve seen now .
okay . the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , right ? it &apos;s incredible , and it &apos;s an amazing student , and they couldn &apos;t say it .
he does this with a hot glue .
what we do is we take the hair as a role model , and imagine that with another colleagues from berkeley .
and , in fact , that inspired by the married leading leading leading men , two thirds of the married men , but only one third of the married women .
monday , i left san francisco , my favorite , and flew to this conference .
and we go out at the end , look at us and say , &quot; how did it happen to you ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous study at harvard business school school , a woman named heidi .
and i &apos;ve got my hand back and i fell in all the other women and then you &apos;ve taken more questions , just by men . &quot;
and a woman contacted me , and i looked at it -- she saw something young .
thank you .
they don &apos;t usually do it as usual , but they do it .
so not fear was the defining factor .
but it &apos;s in the middle of the black .
now , i want to talk about this , thinking about how we spread health care in this country , how we get information .
so you &apos;re in clean , more clear language , and it works .
we tell them that everything is fine ; that it &apos;s going to be you all right .
this patient is about 50 , we can actually say pretty much how big its risk is to get prostate cancer .
they don &apos;t need the level of the audience in this room .
and this bee had certainly accepted , &quot; i get to get these fancy , this flower , this flower , i &apos;ll get the nectar and then i get off . &quot;
and when you talk about nature that is a writer my favorite topic is how the idea of the world is the most important thing ?
well , we &apos;re all equally sophisticated .
the only technology here is the cheap , very new , a car station , which is a car that &apos;s actually being pushed by 10 ar , even in 15 minutes .
if a nuclear scientist , the grass is going to be on this high altitude , and it &apos;s going to happen something interesting .
and now i say that i want to build a layer of games on the world , but that &apos;s not quite true , because it &apos;s already in development ; it &apos;s happening .
if not , it &apos;s a bad thing . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
come to a certain time , you get your drinks half .
and then you can really achieve good kinds of things .
and it &apos;s powerful .
so , the most responsible is a population of a vibrant dynamic that tries to find the best news .
we &apos;ve talked to you last time for many years ago .
you can also see when i turn this around -- hopefully i don &apos;t have the world too much .
you can see here , it &apos;s started .
this is one of our engineers .
fs , who should have been trained to teach students , discovered the law of the exclusive , just as a hobby .
raise your hands .
it makes it a place where it makes fun to work .
and so this is something we &apos;re working on , and we even have people who are excited about it , and they &apos;re really enough to work on it , that &apos;s really their goal .
thank you .
what brunel said , as he said , for his passengers , was the experience of diving through the landscape .
what does life make a simple , pleasant ?
and it &apos;s part of the way that you &apos;re looking at this by building a great new facility , using the basement of your hospitals .
today , the industrial systems of time have been more inclusive and in fact , in fact , part of the present problem .
and as brunel can , we can do it by looking at systems , a bigger effect .
from my persistence , the waiter came to surprise the waiter .
mark blackmore and i &apos;ve tried to answer this question of studies , right now .
yet , it &apos;s exactly what the american paradigm demands .
but for the european , the patent availability was the availability of all these things on the market like a southern gas .
the americans themselves discover that atrazine is more attractive in the theory than in practice .
so , the other thing that &apos;s going to say is , &quot; noah was just like , &quot; &quot; noah was just here for short time , but he taught us so much .
robert frost once said this , &quot; it &apos;s poetry who goes to translate . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant metric of pink . &quot;
the three problems have one in common : they &apos;re the problems that are controlled by natural forces .
so , thank you very much .
it &apos;s replacing competition by collaboration .
and then we build a computer that we can test the peak of the machines , and so we can get very , very quickly .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that the most important thing is that the most important thing is that the most important thing is that it &apos;s going to be a kind of a design effect , but as a function of motion .
the bomb enters the stage .
and then the 92 nuclear power , which would deliver the energy , the rest of los angeles .
then you take it and put it on the screen of your television suit , and you can get it out of the inside , right .
if you replace the word of blogosphere or the internet today , it &apos;s very right that his perception is now very , very controversial . let &apos;s see .
i think it was this exchange that led to physical computers .
ph : i hope you understand how to get the difference .
ultimately , the race has won around the future of momentum than the phone phone company .
mm : because it gave the audience a role to do something .
they produce things for 1,500 and 800 dollars per minute .
and where television has a little bit of what &apos;s built , is a very exciting new kind of communication , and we have the organization of two industries and a new way of thinking about it to see it .
this is an italian architect and designers .
color can be attributed to simple blocks , simple materials : if i go through new york , i think .
it gave me incentive -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco , and we all talk to us and build a few installations .
the use of the city has laid down the public space , is significantly an international role model .
even the parts of the airplane had french words .
he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s more girls there . &quot;
and that was , finally , as i , after some of the most popular and a half , ended up in the chair that i &apos;m going to show you .
he said , you have one of the new , better chairs .
or they &apos;re going to get them up in the position .
i knew , but i knew in experience , and when i looked around in the offices , there was no anyone who would be able to get to the idea of the idea , and the head of the head would be to turn to a plastic suit and
and silk silk has spread into a lot of the time .
two days ago , or yesterday , i can &apos;t remember that in a school room , i read that the first one has been going to be the first of the first time , that the first one has been going to be about 52 lost cases , about
we need something that was really the very natural , so he doesn &apos;t get the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : males are true , all the amount of offspring .
so , the biggest problem is not our biggest problem .
&quot; why now ? &quot; &quot; why ? &quot;
and most of the time i &apos;m not going to remove myself , although i &apos;m a nuclear scientist .
look at the data available .
now , our mobile phones can now engineer a story of our own .
bill mcchrystal : your health depends on where you live .
that &apos;s my grandfather .
and the reason that nobody &apos;s talking about it is that nobody &apos;s talking about it .
as the dawn of the ground is , plants are moving from water from the ground .
here &apos;s the title of a remarkable article from a natural scientist , which is the discussion of the world &apos;s phosphorus crisis .
eighty percent of it is like speaking of .
and instead of taking a dose of 100 percent , we take one of 25 percent .
we have a functioning technology and one that &apos;s going to be a few of the most prolific concerns that we &apos;re going to do on the world &apos;s population .
and he was a &quot; unclear &quot; -- he looked at all the most popular and mutations to find rules and laws , instead of looking at the norms .
and in this example , you see that the individual steps are repeat , but they &apos;re repeat without being more competitive .
as an architect , i just think about relationships between the individual and all the stuff , but in terms of working materials , it &apos;s always going to be a matter of business .
we were getting on the level of the building of the building where we could build the five separate towers , but they should all merge on the 60 floor to a single single single single single floor .
and then let &apos;s go back , a few years later , and we &apos;ll see that this landscape is actually being said to be more honest than rainforest , as after rainforest .
the difference is mostly in the desert in the desert , or maybe the most profitable in the desert , whatever you want .
there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that have been completely disconnected and now on the air .
we doubled the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world just by fertilizers that cause huge problems to the water quality of water quality ; rivers , lakes and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the most important thing for the most important .
but we can do it and there are opportunities .
irrigation is the biggest largest oil system on the top of the road .
work together .
so , what is the system system of sustainability ?
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
the system of system d doesn &apos;t pay taxes .
we interact with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biological generators to amplify these online cells -- muscles .
so this is what it looks like .
here we are , or cut the nerve off , from small parts of the brain &apos;s mass and left other things that gave us our primary design -- signal . two other people who have our hand -- signal gave us .
ak : it works good .
but i can &apos;t put in a electrode and say , &quot; there . &quot;
and that &apos;s our goal -- something clinically more sustainable to have to wear .
this is jesse and he squeeze a computer card .
so thank you very much .
sub-saharan africa is largely , because there are 22 million people living there with hiv , which are estimated 70 percent of the 30 million people around the world .
governments in the ground have to create effective health care for ethical aspects in clinical trials , which are approved in the different developing world , and the world &apos;s organization is being conducted by the government and the most responsible of the study .
the fundamental problems that we &apos;re facing are a lot of consumption and too many people .
so they all meet the criteria that people would usually like .
so you see this power that goes north -- the most responsible thing in this case -- the way to the galapagos goes to the galapagos , and this kind of thing that comes up with the galapagos , the middle of the galapagos .
we also know that not only are threatened by the same , but the other thing that we have is the same oiled valley .
now i want to show you that penguins are moved in in the street .
turbo has arrived with pat to pat the door , and we &apos;ll let him go in and he &apos;s here .
and then there &apos;s another one that comes very comfortable with very comfortable health .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we don &apos;t have solved : our fundamental political geography .
the two parts of a very long line .
again , in the case of mongolia , china was not crossing russia ; it &apos;s called it .
for the country , china reduces its average , so that the most potent and cambodia and cambodia can sell their own , and they &apos;re less useful from the food of the city .
what i want to introduce you to here is i call a day , day day .
these two arrows form a bow , a bow of the plastic , and other infrastructure that connects the west bank to gaza .
most of them .
so what &apos;s next ? how does the future of european union look ?
53 countries and most of the suspects , most of the suspects , are on the map .
this dream is his time .
it &apos;s bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
okay .
and the hormone maneuver that growth is growth .
so how can a hormone end the speed of aging ?
we think insulin and regulation are hormones , which are particularly active under the circumstances of the circumstances -- in good times -- if food is to get the birth , and not much stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details about how it works , but we know that foxo gene has an impact on the life expectancy of people .
and basically , you could change the genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process i talked about , which is the kind of worm that &apos;s very quickly , has a different normal , personal , like a bird , so that the bird can live much longer .
you will never see such a kind of ad , because nike wants you to buy your shoes .
they all show heroes that were got the most common .
it &apos;s like trying to walk against a more successful .
this view is that many more sophisticated things like prozac in essentially change chemistry in the context of the brain , as if it was in fact the brain of a chemical soup would be a chemical soup .
and my favorite colleague seymour was also holding this .
and we found out that , in the process , a mutant , much longer needed to go back to the top of the world , and when we put the genes out , the genes were able to be a role of a role , we could find a
and you &apos;ve been asking that question for a long time for a long time , but you can actually test it .
so , you know , mosquitoes find us in the dark by making us feel more like it . they smell us .
just to see it , that &apos;s the cheese .
people even told me that they &apos;re now supposed to be stung by mosquitos .
in the blink of a computer .
and every time i was looking at the aristotelian view of the eyes of the eyes behind me .
and as a result , fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells .
as we speak , about a reductionist clinical trial , we &apos;re talking about a reductionist clinical trial for the use of stem cells .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have this angels in the world , not just in our country : venezuela . in our entire world .
so what happens if something doesn &apos;t happen ?
but here you see what &apos;s really going on .
i can &apos;t tell you about it , because i stopped the headline .
so , the lazarus adopters : what you don &apos;t know about before the marriage .
but how ?
it &apos;s even better . it seems that we can make these receivers , with the material of material , that dna is coding .
the animal jumps , it &apos;s spreading its wings , it activates these , but it can &apos;t really get it to get the fly between two glass .
for a smart creature like our fly , this rule is not in stone , but it &apos;s changing as the animal learns through experience .
through many such experiments , we were able to calculate the identity of the critic to 12 cells .
there are some ideas in the most responsible and the artificial intelligence , as you could do , but we still haven &apos;t solved one example of just how intelligent behavior of physical interaction is going to live in living matter .
here &apos;s stalin , or actually a more pessimistic of stalin .
ed : all right . tb : okay . a little bit after the inside , please , a little bit more to the center .
from your own experience , i know hospitals can be a very dangerous place for young people .
here &apos;s a picture of my legacy legacy from legacy .
and i &apos;m telling you , this kind of involvement , which is all of you , from your goals to your genes , will change the transformation that we &apos;re going to see in our lifetime in health care .
they don &apos;t stick like a velcro nor a velcro or glue .
here we have the robot .
marc &apos;s building the u.s. bank team .
what would happen if you climb on the bottom of the piece of paper and it got a little bit of a gas , or we would shake the sheet ? &quot;
and so , i &apos;ve done it , and he does this .
of course , it completely different when you saw that in a water scanner .
we &apos;re going to see the rising sea level .
and i would say , the people working in the ocean and think about the goals , we &apos;re the opinion of it .
this is the ship that i was in antarctica for the last three months .
if this ice gets melting the sea level , the sea level goes up to six meters .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news for coral the corals are the galapagos .
you have the temperature temperature .
but then you see the most popular thing in black .
we have very interesting opportunities to the co2 in the atmosphere of millions of years , and we &apos;ve just done it with the only time , but we &apos;re going to go back 20 million years .
and this is the task that einstein asked , trying to figure out how gravity works .
einstein already had room and time , biases and curves to describe gravity .
but deep in the structure of space hidden , so the idea could be more dimensions than we see there .
and as the strings of a cello mixed differently , the strings can actually vibrate in different patterns .
not yet .
is this just an interesting mathematical construction building that may be able to explain some of the most powerful traits of the world , or can we actually demonstrate these extra dimensions ?
so we have two plates here with colored dots .
now , can the predator see the predator , which is it , they attack ?
and what determines sensory information is generally true for all the information .
and we &apos;re looking at about 30 seconds , which is a very hammer in a 18 minutes .
why ? because when the dark in this shadow was actually in shadow and the same amount of light on your eye would have to reflect on the same amount of light , like the orange outside of the shadow , you &apos;d have to reflect more .
where do you know that ?
and she comes into the hive , finds a blank , and your hands -- and that &apos;s honey .
he finds him . madness , right ?
do you agree ? yes ?
there &apos;s no right right there , or wrong .
in 2010 , in new york , not so much .
we &apos;re also a species of storyteller .
now some things : understanding security , the risks , the dangers , the pre-frontal , how they work .
but in a modern and complex world , they need models to understand the many risks that we &apos;re facing .
think of cancer , avian flu , swine flu , sars .
there was no new insight , but less fear .
and there &apos;s another cognitive bias : i call it the , by accepting data that we &apos;re doing , and we &apos;re putting data to the data that we &apos;re doing , and we disagree with our most common .
i know a different group of people , if my airplane was safe to fly .
this is the people .
and he was found here in the near way , at stanford .
they had good experience with their teachers , students .
let me ask you some questions about whether it &apos;s a good choice . &quot;
i took a person to get a person to get them or save them , and i found myself as a volunteer hand , but i found that nobody did anything .
we opened the first section of 2009 .
robert ornish : building a park in the sky
and groups were very often called terrorists .
they need a design process that can deal with the core of this very complicated society with their problems .
it &apos;s about us , probably , for the first time in the history of arab world , a revolution from the ground , a business system .
so , paradox is that this was a promising decade before , and it was from a reason .
once again , ngos don &apos;t call their slogans anymore , but they took them into the negotiations , and they took them into the negotiations , because they follow the victims of these guns .
thank you very much for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think &quot; the &quot; s &quot; is something good .
so this was completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little bit crazy to work on a new new school system .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this strange man in the movie ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the last day , the sun comes out , the insurgency come out , they come right to the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i &apos;m going to admit that i &apos;m a little nervous , because i &apos;m going to tell you a few radical things about how we should think about cancer , to a crowd that is a lot more than i do , and that &apos;s a lot more than
the part of the genome we can read is the list of ingredients .
it &apos;s a huge amount of information in genetics , by simply comparing genetic expression .
and i , &quot; okay . at least this guy is good connected . &quot;
so we &apos;re basically measuring every single single unit of time than a own .
if you have malaria , we give them a little bit of the time , or some of the most cosmopolitan of that .
where we really need to get to this , is the process that &apos;s just going on , and that &apos;s on the level of the design of the brain , which is why the body doesn &apos;t cure itself , how does it normally make it ? &apos; &apos;
danny hillis : understanding cancer through proteomics
they all are members of tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to give up these people .
because at stage three , most of us are .
this is their lobby .
there was no plan . anybody had tried this .
in fact , martin luther kings was in stage three .
so i &apos;m sitting here in this chair , and i don &apos;t do anything . &quot;
and suddenly they took the most popular out and tried to figure out , &quot; how do we ask the population of sub-saharan africa ? &quot;
and we automatically put the little pieces up of plastic up .
and this one , or a viable overlap , that were designed to be just so much to put the taxes to the ground , to the ground that they &apos;re , they were not as a permanent building .
they &apos;re going to be the stability and security , which can offer the lap of uncle , compare them to the kenyan construction of a comic niece in high heels .
but from my perspective , compassion has a problem .
and it &apos;s the most powerful form of the human satisfaction .
i can &apos;t really explain it , and it doesn &apos;t .
stories like this , sign like this , are practical aid in a world that will be demanding to bring compassion to the effects of suffering , which could otherwise deny us .
gandhi was also a really popular man .
and the first day , our most recent , and taught us our motto , and taught us our motto that we had to do every day for the rest of the summer .
this is one of two or three of their known known .
here are some examples .
it turns out we can &apos;t be part of a group without imitating the opinion of the other .
so that &apos;s the world we live in today .
and so i &apos;m trying to learn from my grandfather &apos;s own way to learn .
okay , number two : go into the wild .
and imagine this , you &apos;re going to be a victim , i was born in a very small village in mexico , unfortunately , very , very , very , very , very sophisticated conditions , and my parents had no higher education .
and so we think that through all the changes that are happening , we &apos;re going to be in the world today .
it &apos;s an initiative that is on simple , to go to , and you &apos;re looking at the solutions .
we &apos;ve now sent 30 different technologists in 18 different countries , and we were able to connect millions of people , in the practice of trying to learn what this particular market and demands .
and my father came to me , and he said , &quot; you know , i remember you , that every generation has to make it better than the previous one .
i know many people who are very smart and still say , &quot; why can &apos;t i solve my problem ? &quot;
i started them together with another family .
don &apos;t you believe that we have the responsibility to take meaningful goods ? &quot;
i still go the same four years old ford as well .
but that &apos;s not a good life .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s praying about .
whether you believe it or not , it doesn &apos;t make any difference for me .
so he said , &quot; what do you think in your hand ? &quot;
what &apos;s that in your hand ? &quot; i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball , and this basketball beat her identity , which you &apos;re .
when my kids were still small , i always went into her room , sat on her bed and looked at my children in sleep .
it &apos;s less than i had been in the -- i was recording with three to 10 million -- but yet it &apos;s a very significant number .
in a village , we have 100 laptops , and every containing a different collection of 100 books , so that the village suddenly has 10,000 books .
right , the famous chinese characters for the long-term character .
they answer the question : how does it feel that you can imagine you &apos;re wrong ?
we really learn that really bad lesson .
think about it for a moment , as it is , to feel right .
and unlike all the other animals , we &apos;re obsessed with trying to figure it out .
and i have to tell you that i thought i was writing this incredibly nerdy book about a subject that everybody hate to hate to be a audience that would never be .
the effect of it is not just the wheat &apos;s wheat , but the surrounding grains of grains .
1986 , she came from vietnam to america .
the answer was , &quot; that &apos;s even worse . &quot;
our main team dropped on a third of the average in our industry , and in the five years of the dotcom river , our main footprint has tripled our dna .
and bhutan , for the ones that don &apos;t know , is the recent democracy in the world , only two years old .
it &apos;s actually that we &apos;re going to hunt the west , as if happiness is something we have to capture , a thing that we have to get , or maybe multiple things that we need to get .
and we ask 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s the simplicity .
what we need to learn as leaders is that we can affect the production of production by creating the right conditions , so that our employees can live their calling .
bl : okay . one , two , three .
and under deck tells you the inner ear , you move you . but the eyes are moving in the process with the boat , and say , &quot; i &apos;m still standing there . &quot;
amy , do you come up ?
the method : what did you do ? the result : what did you observe ?
i just read one .
real scientific education should give people a voice and give them a voice to the point , and so amy is going to have the last word in this short story .
poor people don &apos;t have this opportunity .
we went back into the 1970s .
and to join up there , we have to realize that the principle of a computer that we &apos;ve talked about is not just the species we talked about , but our society .
now , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure somebody &apos;s been wondering , &quot; yes , great stuff up there -- but how do i get up there ?
i was a professor at the university of davis , and i got a lot of attention to this , and that allowed me to fund the launch of the program .
we have eight motors in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart , they fall down and they end up here .
i mean , people are asking if cell phones are safe .
you have a coil .
because , remember the original idea of dr. &apos;s favorite , the most important mobile phone of his wife .
and for those who can &apos;t read it , it says , &quot; it seems like this is actually a kind of wireless technology . &quot;
green or natural , which is not going to be approved , is a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the existing toxins of the body in our bodies .
first , a computer , a little bit of , stored with the steel , which is called &quot; the &quot; s death . &quot;
just months later , i learned who he was really .
i &apos;m looking for a cure .
i say , &quot; hold it on life if you can . &quot;
even with this kind of paper , we have the hope of that , and we &apos;ve always redefined hope again .
it &apos;s a feature .
suddenly he knows he had been defeated .
to give you this , we have to go back to the driver &apos;s seat .
we &apos;re doing the area , we &apos;re sending it to people , we sent people into the building , we put the buildings inside , the world &apos;s buildings , the most recent , and we were helping the first time .
if i do this , i &apos;m not doing the original detail . the contrary , i could write story here .
you &apos;ve been diagnosed by the public opinion .
that &apos;s not very good .
and which is a democracy .
here &apos;s the question : which country did better , china or india ?
because the indian man has a advantage of life expectancy in the indian woman .
what political change is , they introduced them to the other .
china , i think , has still some amazing , more fundamental principles -- especially about social capital , public health , a sense for equality that is not there in india .
it was a place where people with these kinds of different things and different kinds of plastic projects and the other things .
and now you have the problem that you spent the whole money in order to afford to help the help of these advanced electronics in these countries and now it &apos;s all useful .
a slightly chaotic environment , where many ideas came up with , where people were more , more interesting , interesting , interesting conversations -- people different in other backgrounds .
about a decade ago , a wonderful computer project , with the name howard , was going to read the name of howard , and read darwin &apos;s notebook from this period .
they &apos;re going to be a fellow party , but everybody said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think it was to do it .
does the other way the other way we do that ?
in the 1970s , the one percent of the national income was in the united states .
many of these political factors can be rough in the category of crony capitalism , political twists , which help a group of good interconnected , but actually nothing good for the rest of us .
as you can see , as a result , as globalization and technological revolution can create this global rule of money , it &apos;s much harder to evaluate all the way .
so they invest unprecedented in time and tools to train their children .
we created the modern media system .
this is his little hand .
one of them is going to be we all die .
this was a huge disappointment for us , because we believed in a new development .
i even think in places like oregon , where you take care of it , and you can eat a toxic dose , just half a percent of people ever have done it .
so , long talk short , you came to canada .
but i heard about cancer as the most popular disease of our time , so how did the good and the bad one together ?
some articles even went to say that skeletal muscle increases is resistant to cancer , and beyond , not only cancer , but it &apos;s not just about cancer , but it &apos;s about the metastases spread into skeletal muscle .
16 percent ! that &apos;s where these are tumors in skeletal muscle , but only 16 percent of the actual metastases -- what &apos;s called the most prolific , that skeletal muscle might be able to control angiogenesis , capable of controlling the tumors that are completely rejected for the
this is a very long idea , but i really think that &apos;s possible .
and then my translator left me .
she was the girl who was in silence for her team .
and i was writing a letter on my best friends in atlanta , georgia , who had a 11 year-old son .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot; i asked the translator .
so the two came to lunch , and we were thrown out of the restaurant .
he had children from all around korea , and he found families for them .
they have a lot of time on the dictionary .
so i open this window , look out , and see how fire is shooting off the side of the hotels . the hotel burns .
so we ran into the bathroom , took towels and thought , and we took the children .
until the adoption is , one year ! what &apos;s going on there ?
this is their favorite .
this is sydney , in a few days , three years old .
but there was no evidence .
there are little planets , there &apos;s bigger planets , there &apos;s big planets , okay .
but there &apos;s a lot more to do .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something that depends on the planet ?
and this deeper gas system , underlying the point of opinion , is that science is , like we know it , to define new things .
okay , so , this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , okay , from here .
thank you very much .
look at , while uganda goes down and zimbabwe , russia goes up to a percent .
they find the highest hiv guess in the world in african countries , and yet they find in senegal , down here , the same rate as in the united states .
look at kenya .
it could be something else , which is the transmission of the transmission .
we know that about five billion people have ever lived .
it wasn &apos;t just a economic story .
and the result is even a bigger divergence in a shorter period than it was in germany .
it &apos;s the same thing with institutions .
you just have to give me food . &quot;
he was wrong .
now , i want to end with three questions to the future billion , shortly in 2016 , when the united states is losing their place as number one economy .
no , we &apos;re probably going to be able to download the vast amount of light that we &apos;ve gathered , regardless of the signs that we &apos;ve lost our work work and other parts of our historical business system .
niall , thank you .
there are many types of spider silk .
spider silk is almost completely completely protein .
the fibers that can make a single spider is quite diverse .
also , a high potential of the potential of your ability to be the capacity to be .
what i want to do is not to make the mermaid , so lovely you may be , but on the photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there are more pictures . there are more photographers .
that sounds alien in our ears , but what &apos;s happening is that 80 percent of the contributors have contributed much .
the first thing that happens when you &apos;re a problem , is that the first goal of the institution is immediately changing by what &apos;s going on to the exploitation of the institution .
the inventor doesn &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states , trying to figure out whether bloggers are journalists or not .
it was made by making their favorite , using many of these tools , and no doubt , the intelligence agencies are doing the same work for attacks the last week .
you have a lot of the stuff that &apos;s probably the healthiest part of the bread , or the fibers , because it &apos;s just fibers , because it &apos;s fibers from fibers .
everything is in his place . first level .
we call it &quot; the &quot; oil &quot; .
but let &apos;s look at the different steps , which is the way that the whole connections to a deeper level -- my search is to be the answer to the question , &quot; what is so special about bread ? &quot;
this is transformation , two different things .
and if you &apos;re shaped , you go back to prove that you &apos;re alive and nature .
if you make this bread , you can use any kind of average of every beer .
it will become a kind of a kind of conceptual process , as we &apos;re working through this talk .
it takes very , very long , these scores , and i work on a piece that &apos;s 180 pages long , and that &apos;s a big part of my life and i &apos;m making the hair .
it &apos;s demonstrated by brian gardner who &apos;s an extraordinary artist .
so , you have a little taste of the piece .
what we did -- betty , one of my students , and i -- we gave the babies two dishes to food : a bowl with a radio tank , and a bowl with a plastic chip .
i mean , last , when we look at babies &apos;s face of the baby , they seem quite useless .
and our babies and children are much longer dependent on us than the babies everybody else .
the main system is bringing them to change the hypothesis .
now there are two things that are really interesting about it .
boy : that &apos;s why .
our consciousness is extremely bright and vivid , and everything else will be dark .
&quot; babies and young kids are like the research and the human species , &quot; says the psychologist alison gopnik . their research , as babies play during playing , they &apos;re exploring the same thing as babies play and make decisions .
if i could borrow you for a little demonstration , to show the difference -- because it &apos;s actually pretty trivial .
then you repeat this process and again , and again , until something comes out of it -- in this case , the character is like me walking straight .
what we really wanted was the whole human body .
you can &apos;t do that for something .
here &apos;s a few simple scenes that he came up with .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we did .
some studio uses our software to do exactly the same thing , and we &apos;re going to get a few of our most powerful ones in a few major major lines .
we thought he just would have the balance .
here you learn to go to the top of the world -- like most of you hopefully know .
but i have to say , i &apos;m never going to forget what happened when i was 13 .
i believe that art and creativity are essential to developing empathy .
if you &apos;re the lonely , you &apos;re writing a new york times column , then you get hundreds of emails . most of what i &apos;ve been going to do today is covered by frustration .

12 years ago , caves started to explain me to the overwhelming , and i moved my research into this direction .
wonderful and grim things .
there &apos;s ice under the surface there .
so they &apos;re a living form of life .
it &apos;s actually so much energy for biology in this cave that there are actually a huge number of internet numbers .
we can see them .
we noticed a few years ago that caves have many properties that were used by the people and other organisms used to be as habitat .
whenever you get a goal to be a goal , you have to put some steps into your orientation , some of the minds of it .

at the beginning of this year , a virtual asteroid sold for a buck real dollar .
the really interesting thing about virtuality is that you can measure them .
well , i could design a game with the name of the name by just getting a million pies , or a thousand pies .
if it &apos;s real boxes , we can &apos;t do much , but in a game we say , &quot; ok . &quot;

if we &apos;re so good , what we &apos;re doing , we shouldn &apos;t be able to create an architectural manifestation that is absolutely opaque by the most sophisticated and the most pervasive ?
the architectural thing was , they said , &quot; simple . &quot;
and this is the actual life of the effort .
the second technology we &apos;ve been using , because we &apos;re using things that you know from the opera opera .
here you see the most powerful configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk about how to collect stories , and then , in some way , to summarize stories .
one of these projects is about a year of age .
these are the pictures that automatically are created .
as long as i was awake , i had the camera around the neck .
you can see a timeline that shows you the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s a lot of the time . well , on .

you don &apos;t do it in the way .
if you saw in 1973 , if you saw a black board from 1993 , the most common one has been a little different since the time of &quot; love story , &quot; but he understood what was there .
i &apos;m about the most popular , i wanted to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you can look at my work next week , and also in the most troubled fashion center in the street , and also in the most troubled fashion .
afghanistan doesn &apos;t think of existential threat for global security .

instead , there was a rigorous optimism set of arguments .
diplomats are digging in a business room .

rory , she said libya to finish .
so here you see two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger , to show you what it looks like .
there are also a lot of the time , and if you &apos;re going to get this kind of carbon , you &apos;re going to use this kind of thing , and that &apos;s a different kind of mass of a different type of pollen .
the most powerful thing . this is a difficult problem for reasons i &apos;m not going to be going to be involved in .
there &apos;s another one , very interesting connection , and this is that what you want to do is to lead to a lot of information about a general , pretty bad phone system .
so , i think it has the minimal food that we can probably achieve to make things .

there &apos;s a book that says , &quot; what &apos;s the most the kind of the world &apos;s office with kansas ? &quot;
so we need to ask ourselves why .
but nevertheless , you don &apos;t interact much with people who are not like yourself .
so we can think of things like the design chain .

but my experience with the islamic world is very different .
so , there &apos;s a bit of the character that surrounds you .
and why does sex lead to babies , and why does babies mean a passive disaster ?
because it &apos;s the secret of the desire .
especially , in this description of the other or my self -- that &apos;s the same -- particularly interesting that there &apos;s no way to be in the desire .
this is her favorite , and it &apos;s a kind of thing that is biology , the natural instinct .
and then this is what the desire is going to be , this is what we need to do , which is the curiosity .
you know that there &apos;s an erotic space that &apos;s all alone .
other places in the country had similar spaces .
in a corporate cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
ok .
that &apos;s mostly played in smaller rooms .
so early , some digits have some places .
so i asked myself , ok , is this a model for design , that adaptation that we practice ?
thank you very much .

how do we solve the next three problems that i want to bring to language ?
albert einstein -- i &apos;m talking about somebody when i was in princeton , and i met mr. einstein .
what &apos;s the life ? why am i here ?
i never read a talk or a lecture or a lecture .

lg : so happy .
cosmic realized realized computers can do the necessary thing to prepare and make insights and decisions .
every interaction is recorded by more sensors : your phone , your credit card , your computer , you &apos;re a lot of data and we get the opportunity to understand our own way of understanding our own life .
these records were human rights .
by a sophisticated process , what else was a job for 40 people , to a simple job for three months , was to be a simple job for three people in 40 hours .
we should stop seeing out .
for dinner , my wife and children go home .
because people say , &quot; shit man , i don &apos;t have a time to get a fit . &quot;

help me make a new black , and help me make sustainability sexy .
so i thought that this would be a chance to use scratch , to make a interactive map for my mother .
but i &apos;m skeptical , which is the kind of this thing that i &apos;m skeptical of .
in this case , you take a laser , put it on a pile and determine the pile of the different characters that are in a game or a story , in this case , the great fish .
if you learn to code , you can program to learn .
if kids like victor , they &apos;re creating these projects , they learn important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s just the beginning .
what i want to talk about today is to give you a background , the idea is that cars are art .
i want to talk about that .
and i think that this thought , that great cars is a soul , is very useful . they all know that . they see a car with a soul with the first sight . they know how strong it is .
this is one of my favorite projects that really describes our relationship to cars .
right ? and they decided that it would be cheaper , instead of a studio and six or seven homes of elizabeth , in malibu .
there was a lot of dialogue .
i think we felt very close to this day , we broke out strings , and we were doing the concept of the actual creature of true design and creativity .
we didn &apos;t get him to boston .
i just have a little laboratory .
now we &apos;ve taken clinical trials in four years of this disease .
we don &apos;t have a team of military and we have a team of culture that can transcend this drug in the market .
100 billion is the only number you have to know .
what you need to remember is that we have to do with a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , with a hundred billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t explained was why entropy was ever low .
unlike the low entropy of early universe , although we don &apos;t know the answer to it , we have a good theory that can explain that if this theory is true , and that the theory of the dark energy .
and therefore , although the universe will stay forever , and ordinary matter and radiation will be moved away , there &apos;s always a certain amount of radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even in empty space .
but we also give it big fluctuations .
it stops .
it &apos;s a sharp fact of the universe that you &apos;re accepting and not question .
i had never used a computer .
it was a future i couldn &apos;t accept .
now i want to go out to all of those out there , like me , say , to the african and the poor people who are fighting with their dreams .
no matter what movement i did in my real world , just to replicate my little device in the digital world , eight years ago , in 2000 .
i took this very literally , i took my bike bike , and i put it a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a video that &apos;s going to be good at the table of the machine .
the camera doesn &apos;t really understand my movements , but it &apos;s also capable of understanding what i think is in my hand .
and why just is the case ? we can just play with documents .
all the work you saw is about learning in india .
this is cis-3-hexene-1-ol carlos , king of spain .
this is going to be the third park in rio , june , this year .
again , you don &apos;t have to dig down under the earth to go to a subway station .
i &apos;ll give you a quick example here .
almost every year we have these terrible folk structures .
we &apos;re under the average in the city in the city .
a city of the future is a city that no one is cut from this great community , which is cities .
the best answer is to try to reconstruct a darwinian engineering system of our artistic and aesthetic preferences .
so the trick of evolution is to make it beautiful , so that they put a kind of attraction , so they &apos;re making joy , just look at them .
and some are in every case to be too big to use it for battles .
our strong response to images , for expression of emotions in art , to the beauty of music before the night sky , is going to be in us and our offspring , as long as the human race exists .
well , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see here the computer sees the environment , and you can &apos;t see the vibration , we actually , we actually , actually , are the driver , and it can actually see what &apos;s going on .
so , let &apos;s see mark can avoid it .
or for blind people , in everyday devices , in education and the office .
a subtle amount of noise had begun . the most popular , that ordinary people don &apos;t hear any voices and i heard them , but i was sure that something couldn &apos;t vote with me .
my mental health was a catalyst for a computer company , dancing and physical and sexual health , and i was told by my psychiatrist , &quot; eleanor , with cancer , you &apos;re better than healing . &quot;
to be a drug , if the social change begins , it can &apos;t be a dried .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing right now .
so what i &apos;m proposing is that there &apos;s where we should be searching for life , rather than mars , of course , even though mars is a very much more powerful and interesting place .
and the ordinary astronomers were full of contempt about it .
because it &apos;s the way that life can live out there , it has tremendous benefits compared to the life on a planet .
there was another object , this high rubber furniture with creatures and steel and naked -- pretty scary things for a small child .
the first projects were humility , but they took technology and turned it into things that people are using to use a new way of using a new functionality .
the other thing that &apos;s the most interesting thing is that we decided that we decided to do all the technical tests , this whole kind of energy , and trying to do it as beautiful as possible .
so we called it y water . so this is another example of all that happens in a room , which is the three-dimensional design , the ideas that are the development of brand , it &apos;s all intimately interconnected .
this is my brother anthony , switzerland , he had the laptop for a afternoon , i had to go back to him . that was hard .
yves behar : the design of objects that tell stories
thank you .
my aunt , an incredibly , incredibly , brilliant woman , was early widow .
she was the most popular of women i &apos;ve ever heard .
look at these young girls who go back to school after acid was in their faces . &quot;
the world , the layma &apos;s had had been given a world in war .
then the situation becomes tectonic .
they need to negotiate .
it &apos;s the people from my generation growing up in a world where everything is all the most common and in a few of our best conversations on a screen .
ultimately , it could mean that you could print your own medicine .
and if it &apos;s confused , why that &apos;s interesting , then you have to look at the rest of saudi arabia , because it &apos;s a country that is tough between the males .
maybe some things are bad traditions and they need changes .
let me give you an example : turkey , where i &apos;m from , which is a very high republic , we had a little bit of saying that i was going to call the universities against the students , against the students .
if i was the only person that thinks that , then we would have a problem .
in the 19th century , as muslims , as the example of europe , they were independent , they were independent .
so the e.u. was going to join the world &apos;s efforts , the e.u. , in the european muslim , supporting the majority of the scholars , as a few more people were against the scholars .
there &apos;s a very large nose that doesn &apos;t seem to be the case of what they &apos;re doing with anything .
if scientists are going to be able to make a century , a century , neurons are going to be visible , and they &apos;re going to go to darkness , instead of darkness .
carl libeskind : insights in the inside of our brain
but this trend is not clear .
but for many parts of africa , it &apos;s a colleague of mine , &quot; the occupation was just voted at the right time , so the genocide could start to the right time . &quot;
and instead of putting this possibility to put local leaders , local leaders are soon thrown up and have been a chance to get distracted by the second fill-up of the world &apos;s population . september 2001 and the wars in iraq and iraq .
design design requires a strong focus on the top of the world , and the most powerful , and loneliness and the most powerful .
the stromatolites are the heroes of my story .
in flat seas , life has already been revealed , and it turned out to be more complex .
it &apos;s a lot of the way we did it . the big voyage of shoreline .
some of the mammals went back to the water .
every man should have a chance of integrating something a luxury .
but there was nothing for this purpose , so we &apos;ve got a lot of the time with prostate cancer and then we created our motto , which is , &quot; the face of the man &apos;s health change . &quot;
mo hayes from canada , from the united states , and from england to us and said , &quot; hey , there &apos;s nothing for prostate cancer .
and i said , &quot; last year we had the lucky to have 450 eyesight . &quot;
this kind of entertainment , men involved in each age , is so critical and important , and i think that &apos;s more important than the money we collect .
he could see what happened to his forest , his environment , because his grandfather took him under his wing , and he started to teach him about the forest and started teaching his people about the forest and the way of teaching his people .
when i thought about it , i wonder what our grandchildren and our great-grandparents would respond to when they ask the same question .
we need new models to be a leader and human beings .
it works with people like the lemonade krishna .
a life long , through everything , about the cultural revolution and everything that came out , he would have collected so that he &apos;s going to document over eight million parts of his history .
it &apos;s just happening .
&quot; my world is subjective . &quot;
or maybe he was a confession sitting on a rock and the sky of the sky , and the sun and the moon .
and if you have a remarkably successful life , you will get into the kitchen , or , like the french , the &quot; the &quot; -- &quot; the &quot; the &quot; -- &quot; the sky -- the sky of the world &apos;s .
and so it comes to these great rituals where great health companies are built in the world &apos;s top of the world , and they &apos;re being replaced for 10 days ...

&quot; why i &apos;ve chosen this path , why don &apos;t i get the procedures , just get me , please . &quot;
optimists are opening up the eyes for a new view of the myths of india and the west -- and shows why these are the systems of the world &apos;s worth of the world , the death of the death of the death , with death and the most responsible
but you know what ? it &apos;s almost 2012 and the world , &quot; i &apos;m totally competent , &quot; and it &apos;s not like to eliminate itself with the weakest praise .
you &apos;re interested in what ?
their friends and family will gather together at the cemetery , and there &apos;s a tombstone , and it &apos;s written on their grave , &quot; here &apos;s a great engineer that invented velcro . &quot;
they &apos;re thrilled . this is the conversation , the mothers and fathers want to hear because their child is good in math and you know what next .
that &apos;s because you know -- you know what you &apos;re .
i have no patents and i never get money from a medical school system , and i don &apos;t get to get them to choose me .
so where do you know if your breast is high density ?
ultrasound has more filaments to the consequence of other technologies that are in the relationship and it &apos;s not very prevalent .
if you find a tumor , as long as it &apos;s less than a centimeter , survival is due to 90 percent , but it falls a huge increase with increasing energy .
the image of mbi shows this tumor much more clearly , just like a second tumor , which is very much on the surgical possibilities of patient .
it costs a radiologists in particular to become an expert in which a normal personality detail is different from a very different point of view .
some women who are dying of breast cancer , many years later , and fortunately , most of them are survival .

we gather this physicist in los angeles to see what they build .
mill .
they slept in this lecture .
this is an incredible vision .
it &apos;s a question of consequences .
so let &apos;s go on the point .
what did i do ? i heard my stomach ?
this is interesting . this is a different way to think .
and drowning is basically a visualization of a human being , where everyone is a part of the body that he &apos;s going to do in the brain .
this is white noise .
and db is probably going to roll in your direction .
i did just to make money .

the tragedies of other people can take easier than the own and i want to be the same spirit of this conference .
malcolm gladwell was the chief of cocaine that was the most popular version of soup for the city .
he was a really interesting sight .
he went back into the second floor , and he said , &quot; hey boys .
like mcdonald &apos;s .
let &apos;s think about other people &apos;s thinking , where you can expect a very high risk .
the second reason was that the gang was in marketing and was the .
economists talk about game theory -- that every game for two people have a computer program .
so , the diamond is skydiving with a board on the feet .
so , on the high level of magnitude , it &apos;s just possible if you take step for step , if you really have a lot of work and mentally , and you &apos;re working on it .
ue : no . that &apos;s just smoke .
occasionally i meet with scientists .
so i had hope that , by having some natural elements , a little bit of fog , a little bit of fog , i could make the room tangible .
mycorrhiza is that it makes a difference , whether you do something or not .
the big mountains in the distance are less moving .
how do we create a notion that is both linked to individuality , and also to avert , without the two different directions in two different directions ?
i talked about new kinds of oil , one , the animals , instead of eating them .

as a adult , when i was about the amazing insights of penny , and calf , sue savage-rumbaugh with kanzi and panbanisha , unmarried , and alex , the conference conference , i heard that i was excited about this .
so , juggling &apos;s favorite : ng : how to do this .
we &apos;re in the national aquarium , we &apos;re involved in the original world &apos;s exploration , for research and finance .
but we found pretty quickly that we had created a system that connects people to each other .
now , this is the first time you talk about this topic .
this is a picture of me and my daughter we have a israeli flag .
&quot; because it works , make a poster with me . &quot;
they came and they were so many . one day , i remember that libya spoke to a journalist and asked him , &quot; who will see this ? &quot; and he said , &quot; everybody . &quot;
it &apos;s not the most popular . it &apos;s not my side .
and sometimes war is a war . but sometimes , with a little bit of effort , we can avoid it .
and what we want to do with &quot; yes is more , &quot; trying to question that the architectural risk of the architectural is almost negative , and so against who or what we are .
and we saw this guy , the dance guy .
and slowly , you start thinking that sustainable life makes less fun than living in normal .
so , you go to the expo first , and you get a little bit of a bike wheel , and you go to the other side of the other hand .
it was interesting because it was about nine to 11 about the most 11 of the news , and how many billions of billions of people should invest in the train of the economy .
this is a rock of switzerland . in switzerland , there &apos;s a national need to be in the world &apos;s worth of smallpox .
we often make small films .
what i &apos;d like to talk about would be the biggest problems in the world .
but it &apos;s of course a problem when you press people to focus on problems .
so what i &apos;m going to wrap up is really to say that we have a very long time to have a situation that we had a number of choices .
and then you ask , why economists ?
but it says that what we can do about it is very little , too high cost .
the most expensive at malaria is a few million infected per year .
what &apos;s happening here is that we think about our priorities .
it &apos;s a good movie in terms of that , i &apos;m sure i want to see it , right , but don &apos;t expect to be in the next movie of brad pitt &apos;s day , like he &apos;s going on in tanzania , or something like that .
they all had the same material , but they were able to leave the amount of discussion , and they &apos;ve made sure they were doing their own lists .
and to create wealth and greater freedom , is the more powerful . &quot;
secondly , china has managed to reduce income income dramatically , without changing the political framework .
and freedom house , though , found that even though 50 percent of all countries are democratic , 70 percent of them are predictable , in terms of that that people don &apos;t have a food care or a drug problem .
because finally , the question that we have and seven billion other people on this planet is , how can we create wealth ?
the most powerful is not really right in your place .
we &apos;re going to do what we really are interested in .
it was published six months ago , and she &apos;s going to get incredible attention .
you have to make a sense of growth for growth .
i think it looks easy to human skin , which is fascinated me .
but i think it could be a fairly smart and sustainable supplement to our energy consumption .
chinese workers are not going to be in the factories of our own demand for ipods .
just because one person has spent their time to make a piece of something called it that it &apos;s going to be a piece of something .
min &apos;s sister turned to him and said , &quot; some understanding that . you don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
this is the most popular , the min in the home to her family in the train .
the taliban are doing their own schools .
if any child gets caught up to break these rules , it &apos;s very stiff .
if i look at suicide bombers , the younger ones are when i , or in my age , i feel so inspired by their attacks .
and this is going to be on the back , and there &apos;s a lot of time to go there , waiting at enceladus , which hopefully is in the middle future , specifically equipped to the question .
is the internet actually a place where you can visit ?
and the landscape changes . three years ago , when i started to deal with it , there was just a wire along the african west coast , shown here in this map of steve song , and here &apos;s a thin black line .
and that &apos;s not exactly what i &apos;m doing .
this data is sent up by layer on the device , starting with the basis of the product , and puts it on the material layer on layer , by the new consumer layer in a field of energy , which is going to be the old layer of the
it was made by the layers of layers of layers of about four .
a repulsion is probably going to be less likely .
you can just make it right in front of you .
this is what the product is made .
without any doubt , i think that technology is creating a revolution in production and the most powerful as we &apos;re going to know them .
he was worried that when he called it in this name , especially outside , in the public , you might think he would be the notion of jihad .
they use their own business .
the good news is that it has to be not that way .
but many of these factors that played a role , even more powerful , is done half the work .
i was with my friend susan dunlap who was a photographer in mathare valley .
she said , &quot; you know , poverty wasn &apos;t the bad . it was the humiliation and the embarrassment of all the things . &quot;
do you think i &apos;m going to miss the violence or the drugs ? the lack of privacy ?
first , instead of months of months , and forget about the time , the time was very much more nuanced .
but it &apos;s less likely to remain that they remain .
and during my first year , i ran my company on .
it &apos;s actually said that more energy needs to make a solar cell , and it &apos;s going to be in your entire water supply .
solar cells are going to collect four and a half hours long .
and they &apos;re also under big pressure , and so they &apos;re dangerous .
this is a computer factory .
it &apos;s just a little cylinder down here , which is the generator and all the most common in it , and this is the hot thing that &apos;s hot , the hot cylinder of the upper end -- that part is going to be hot , and it &apos;s
you don &apos;t have to use the hot water , it can also cool down .
so here we have a map of the united states .
and we don &apos;t have an overlap to use this energy so fast , as we &apos;re doing right now .
we &apos;re destroying it and look at the parts .
it &apos;s a flying lab that we did in the measurements of this molecule .
but i still wrote bad poems , and he never pushed the word in the air , but he went to cuba .
so , from the ted community , great things can happen -- -- which i then have a picture of the way that i &apos;m going to go in my work .
i work for the new york and i do the new york , and then the 11th came , and that was , um , a , a single , a complete end of the world as we knew it .
then , &quot; summarize , you &apos;re very eager to be a bow , but that &apos;s how we understand it . &quot;
&quot; and he decided to be extinct his favorite of his life . &quot;
this man is angry because someone on his staircase is being bent up on his staircase , and basically , you know , you seem to be here .
and she &apos;s gone through george &apos;s , so i don &apos;t think it &apos;s .
td : since my youngest childhood and after , many different consultants were given , and when i was young , i always came to the fact that my way was already a lot of the way .
this is beautiful , but we should remember that a similar process should be on the interior level .
td : lakshmi , he worked incredibly hard , even for my invitation , let &apos;s do anything else that she did so that i was going to have this and i was pretty resistant , and i was also very nervous during this whole week .
in these two examples , we &apos;ve seen machines that have learned to go to the simulation , and others who have learned it in the reality .
if i say , &quot; we , &quot; i mean the advice for the design of the gun .
but nobody believes that it &apos;s actually going to be very effective if there &apos;s a real outbreak .
the biggest part of the administration in the administration is actually more likely to connect with anthrax and the threat through biological biology .
we know that the virus is being interpreted . it will be another virus .
but in the scientific community , there &apos;s a debate about which percentage of the most prolific between people are attracted to seoul and mutilated and how much about the hands .
some of the poorest countries that have most experience with h5n1 , have camp , have been full of drugs that are already raised .
and i think even our leaders would say that we have a lot to do in this case .
i &apos;m very pleased to answer their questions .
our centers for the world &apos;s own family has evolved one of them , as rapid as rapid as a result .
and in the already way , in the most recent , people were similar bacterial infections also .
don &apos;t just pay attention to how much fun you have , but also how the breaks of mobility changes completely the way that you &apos;re going to interact with a city like san francisco .
please put a video on me .
i &apos;m going to get a boy &apos;s degree of a force , and he &apos;s a little juggler , and he &apos;s a few clubs to sell me three clubs .
i &apos;ve been working with my childhood , and i was working with flies , so the case is done , so i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m going to be a computer card .
manhattan is not more to the infinite .
so i &apos;m not supposed to be here , right ?
i &apos;m going to stay in the middle .
it became one , drove me to the triumph .
because of the power leaves and branches , it &apos;s very dark in the most dark and very quiet .
and i &apos;m interested in my colleagues &apos; s , and i &apos;m interested in the dynamic of the animal &apos;s dynamics that live in the forest .
we &apos;re advising the media about the media of technology ; we have a computer company ; we have a computer company .
and then the students in our recording record came , and they took their own little coat beats with their own beats .
and our new project is that the inmates and we learn to grow the frog &apos;s frog , which is a highly endangered endangered species of endangered populations in the states in washington and oregon .
he said , &quot; look what you have hidden you . &quot;
so we &apos;re looking at a rising demand , and therefore , therefore we &apos;re looking at a rising demand .
they &apos;re not a magician . they &apos;re not our parents .
you &apos;ve got to believe me . trust me . &quot;
and i learned two really important things that day .
the deeper we go under water , the higher is the pressure .
so i started about 15 years ago .
and then the air goes into the street , and then comes out of the air , the air comes out of the street .
each of these computers can run the entire system , so if two of them are getting together , there are reserves .
but this is what it looks like , and this habitat is always continuing to go over many miles .
so sharks are not quite so dangerous as most people are facing .
when we found him , we didn &apos;t even have any reason to know what family he said , so we called him a lot of the time , and he looked like this , when he looked like this , he looked like he was coming out of his
oxygen oxygen has a marilyn and he was freezing .
this means that every one of them and each of them have seen at least one child , which is suffering in a developmental disorder .
and its communication and social interaction improved that it could go to a normal school and even become a more somber .
he &apos;s like life : if you &apos;re in one place , you can &apos;t get out again .
i know you &apos;ve never heard of him . but you &apos;ll notice this day , you &apos;ll hear about him , because he &apos;s a fascinating man . &quot;
nk : no , he died before 25 years ago .
he had a lot of love , he loved everyone .
we , all of us , are what happens when a soup of hydrogen and helium helium is so long that they start asking themselves about their origins .
these are the most precious things that life can exist in many other environments .
so you have to really appreciate the diversity and the incredible scale of life on this planet in the first step to be able to make a contact with life in all of all sense .
so it &apos;s so important to be silicon , and we &apos;re going to be working on the future by expanding it by 350 antennae , so it &apos;s sensitive to the moore &apos;s act of increasing computing .
and then we &apos;d like to make the most powerful search through human communication .
many people say it &apos;s the best place to study the development of climate change .
every cylinder is a very reactive of time .
while you &apos;re blowing the ice , it &apos;s warm , you get a extra pair of gloves in a oven so that you can put a new pair of gloves , if your fingers are swallowed and get confused .
i think that &apos;s a little bit of a standard , a little bit of economic field .
and our soldiers don &apos;t just look forward to the latent church , if they actually reported to service , to be able to put american security care to the service of american food .
you can still push that , and the efficiency almost triple with some of the most powerful improvements and the gross credit of the great gas system .
we could build bigger cars , which would contribute to security , but they should be easy .
but instead , they sell it to china , and japan , because we have our own investment , and we don &apos;t have the other .
and that &apos;s what the pace of production of mass production does , or in this case , is to make a manufacturing model of the form of materials , or in this case , to make a good job , as a good thing , the most powerful ,
it can &apos;t just act on a giant conspiracy .
there were two types of negative feedback that we have .
we hope that it &apos;s really stable .
oops , i was wrong .
and at the end , he found a dutch , dutch , dutch , called the han van meegeren who he sold a wonderful vermeer to a prize that &apos;s about 10 million dollars .
according to his favorite , he saw when he had discovered it &apos;s been bad in the world . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s coming . what is it ? &quot; is a good answer .
but how attractive you find them how much they are sexually , or romantic , depends on what they think they &apos;re looking at .
but each of these three objects have value a value beyond what it brings to one , because his story .
but i don &apos;t want a copy , even though i can &apos;t see the difference .
so he brought joshua bell to take his favorite tour with a subway station in washington d.c. , to put a corner and see how much money he will take .
the second shock is less painful , because you &apos;re getting a little bit of it .
and if you &apos;re going to see , you can see that there may be a kind of political policy .
they &apos;re doing a blood storage , professional member of the american , of the american , which sounds very glamorous and exciting .
and what you find is , of course , people who eat vegetables and olive oil have fewer , fewer .
the most intriguing thing is one of the most intriguing things in the world of medicine .
it &apos;s a complete conclusion , if you give a drug in such a high dose , that it &apos;s going to have more side effects , and that your new drug will look better .
the big trials are closer to the real answer .
this is a problem that is not there for the right time .
and very soon they would have started this coal , 2,000 square miles around , a ton of miles , to the city , to china , back to china and all over the world .
can you imagine how you feel if you were in my mind ?
it &apos;s just about oil ; you know that , all knowledge .
there &apos;s this thing that &apos;s the world &apos;s favorite , and that &apos;s right from the middle of the united states .
and what do you see ? you &apos;re christians .
the man who , americans , are kind of like , &quot; ah , pennsylvania .
these christians are the ones .
they adored . that &apos;s wrong .
and the soldiers are chinese , and all the chinese are chinese .
can you imagine that maybe one of them at the morning is being bent down to his child and he said , &quot; honey , i &apos;m back afterwards .
everything has changed .
and all this has been huge implications to the world .
i think thomas jefferson actually hired this very well in words .
for the most powerful in the audience , even though we have a greater budget , why a little more than a comedy is a comedy , that &apos;s because it &apos;s easier to translate into other languages and cultures . so the market is bigger for these films .
but it will happen within this century .
this is not the most important of the united states , which is going to be about a million , but gdp of the world per capita -- 200,000 dollars .
and as anybody here knows -- it &apos;s about energy , not oil .
my choice is the pinnacle of a lifetime that started growing up with the growing of the gulf of the gulf .
a lot of our actions on this planet , which are on our living environment , are just by belief and guess .
one has been a couple of millions of years .
we have to calm down , before we beat the planet .
e. wilson : saving life on earth
another is the famous european aurochs .
the passenger pigeon the passenger pigeon contains 1.3 billion base pairs .
the reversal of the extinction is in these category .
real falcon from lightly chicken chicken .
and there &apos;s a program behind that , which is just brilliant .
this is an emotional issue . some people got up .
my grandmother was a hippie .
i also made my own comics , which was another way to tell stories , to tell stories and images .
and we sat there , and we were in silence , and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really talented . &quot;
use your own style . draw , not how you tell you .
&quot; prefer jarrett , i have your favorite .
i &apos;m also going to publish a children &apos;s book with the title : &quot; the police police police &quot; -- the most responsible police .
sound affects us all the physiological things , psychological , cognitively and more skilled .
this is a 32 million pounds expensive , important , most important , which was recently built in england , designed by a british national school .
but it &apos;s not just kids who are affected by it .
people who say , let &apos;s not sit next to this team , because the noise and the other quiet need .
&quot; upwake &quot; tells a story about zero , an contemporary business company that his life is carrying in the suitcase with himself , and the dream and reality is widely , and not able to do both of these things .
and the number of years and four years and four years and high years , what was going on when the first thing was a computer project , was a professional disabled act of talented actors .
i know theater connects us .
now , the time we can use the diversity of our talents to create a intelligent , important and extraordinary work . and then , apart .
if you look around in the bathroom , you see some products more than for example , like the ted system , the more unfair , and also the rebellion .
and the media &apos;s protein -- or , since the &apos; 70s , collagen -- is used to inject it in folding .
i found around all the time .
and i said , &quot; my love , i fear you have a long and a half year . &quot;
i told them , they should be in front of themselves : &quot; i &apos;m somebody .
they &apos;ve given me to be somebody in a time where i was like a no one felt like one .
they &apos;re working on the ninth copy of the day , so they started in the 1930s , and now the letters p .
hundreds of verbs can behave like this .
you can see that as the language of thoughts , or &quot; the &quot; s . &quot;
so the puzzle is , why are you paying , polite requests , helen and threats so often ?
you can try to imagine what would be if language could only be used literally .
and the other puzzle is that i don &apos;t have a problem with it .
here &apos;s my argument . is it sustainable ? is it good ?
it &apos;s going to be a lot of the power . it &apos;s a lot of the power .
what are you going to have to win from that to me ?
all these different roles . can you imagine an argument where they &apos;re sitting , but in the audience , and looking at the debate ?
or -- and that &apos;s the most powerful part for me : we want them to be in the world of nature , we bring a design design and find the master of the adaptation that could inspire us .
it changed all . from there , these engineers weren &apos;t in the boat , in fact , in the same way .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here &apos;s how we make things .
this is the most powerful national laboratory .
that would be a fuel system for fuel cells , if you could get a centrifuge .
this is not easy , because life uses a subset of the elements in the periodic table .
feel , and react to feedback is very important .
what you don &apos;t see is you can &apos;t count .
my first business was a computer company . i started under the taliban .
in south korea and indonesia , almost half a million companies are women .
because , as from the most violent , smaller amounts of growth in direct terms of increased economic growth .
and in all the world , there are no exceptions .
people are doing this delight and this miracle .
i have a big kind of introduction of caution , and i &apos;m looking into a little bit of a motorcycle , and i &apos;d like to use a paper towel to use it to be a paper towel .
we did it first .
what does that mean ?
when i started to engage with you , i realized that they have adapted to be incredibly adapted .
but the researchers had a problem .
until they finally went to their degree , and they left the campus -- and sure they were going to come back -- some time later , and found that the crows still fell on them .
we &apos;ve found that they &apos;re really smart and they &apos;re teaching each other to teach each other .
for example , squirrel would come to come , looking for the peanut and go again .
but there were three problems , three puzzles that i couldn &apos;t solve , and i want to talk about it , but more importantly , i found a computer .
who would ever hire me ? &quot;
and imagine what could happen , because every region has something .
let me make the connection .
you know that there &apos;s the future of the future . you have to understand that .
this is a lot to be too simplistic .
oh yeah , i &apos;m going to be johnny &apos;s favorite .
about 10 million of the u.s. networks .
and over here , we see , with the words of the radiologists , the radiologists are being greeted by a way that they &apos;re in a way , and they &apos;re in a way that remembers the most profitable . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yes , but i would rather be eating if you don &apos;t have anything about it . &quot;
i said , &quot; you should do a experiment .
he had a line in his book , who was expected to be expected from the most responsible , because there was a retired maria called the difficulty , the difficulty with conception .
so now you have an evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i have to read you what she said because i find it so beautiful .
i find that very unfortunate . not because i &apos;d want to use it . i wanted to see him .
and that &apos;s actually the beginning of our story .
now i thought that at the moment , at age 50 , one of the skills that i really got was to tie my shoes .
first of all , i have to tell you that i &apos;m not from here .
yes . the artist doesn &apos;t seem to know what to do the different colors .
but i can see in your faces that you &apos;re still a bit skeptical .
it &apos;s called &quot; the &quot; s &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
after a while , i decided to have fun , and before i left the room , i fell down a few things in the room .
and now they &apos;re all in there .
so my father was a , my youth was in favor of interesting .
the song as a mere fact .
i &apos;m , &quot; wait , &quot; wait , is it good -- i &apos;m going to take the wheels out of scratch , and i just bought the weird wheels , and i built them , and i could do it , and i could do it .
it just sounds like , but i think we have a serious , in general society , with intent .
he was designed the wet self , and he was really proud of it .
human beings , i love this thing .
the consequences of a planet , on the already seven billion people live .
especially proud of it was on the cushy seat , the real easy seat he had given his most threatening , and on the beautiful , the seat around the seat .
intent -- a life with intent -- consciously lived , the original something that works .
i saw the healthy mass of a left , and i was hoping that they were lost , they were all lost , but not yet possible .
then i started thinking , how many times before , how did my life be different if this man had not hurt me if my genes had a different portion of experience .
i was , but i was now a more skeptical , and i think that i was , i think , myself .
i hoped a lot of simpler , and i hoped that the turkish family was to trade four words and to make me go back to my journey .
he spent six months in prison , lost his computer for a decade .
yes , contrast .
we &apos;re working with the machine lab lab at the university of california , san diego together .
first , the perception of people , and second , a natural interface , a natural form of control , so that interaction with the robot is intuitive .
and yet , i made this idea to be being satisfied .
after i realized that economic danger , i thought we need to find a solution for this problem .
some of the people have even read about the speakers , like nathan ornish , or the one of tim ferriss , who may occasionally be considered as a very hard .
i don &apos;t know a tedtalk that includes this .
this time i paid 25 cents , because i found that the task was a little harder .
and yet , there was one of the things that all of you were sure : the expansion had to slow down .
keep the mystery of the dark energy in the back of the head because i &apos;m going to give you three main points to string theory .
the candidate tuna went on about 10 feet .
and he worked at decades of explaining this number , but he didn &apos;t have success , and we know why .
each of these universes have additional dimensions .
because the astronomers from today , using powerful telescopes to the sky , finds a handful of photons -- a kind of cosmic cable , billions of years on the road .
well , i want to be honest with you and tell you that most of it is just a trick , but a trick that actually works .
think about it , it &apos;s the first time you &apos;re going to meet it . we want to really do it and make more important .
he said , &quot; go , milo . squash it . &quot;
pm : that &apos;s dimitri &apos;s right in a business .
we know nobody here .
the next moment , the phone doesn &apos;t work anymore , the tv is going to be , poor men are on the street .
it was a very grim meeting in the reporter who had worked in war , who had employees , and of course the bold , brave people of sarajevo himself .
if i asked why i &apos;m going to keep doing the same thing , why i &apos;m going to stay in the process of doing that .
but it &apos;s my job of this testimony , and this is the most popular , the core of the thing , for us reporters .
even before a goal , it seems to be the joystick that you &apos;re trying to get into the joystick cursor , and try to find aurora the goal , no matter where it is .
basically , we trained the animals to try to control these kinds of things and explore objects in the virtual world .
in a experiment we did a few years ago , we went to the limit .
so we start in china .
so , dai manju did the most successful .
please raise your hand .
the last reason has to do that is that women are part of the solution .
in niger , in the average one of seven women die of a child .
it was part of the solution , not the problem .
larry ornish , as he was a computer bank of the world bank , once said , &quot; it can be good that investment is going to be the highest energy in the developing world . &quot;
this is bill &apos;s book .
and that was the feather of a bird .
this whole gyre of the entire pacific is telling us that there &apos;s a single kind of a gas system .
and even this picture makes the suspects , to be aware of , to be a sense of the idea of the one of the most responsible &amp; amp ; resilience &apos;s circus circus .
one of those options was that we could have better in a little bit of food .
they put their arrowheads down and say , &quot; i want to share these arrowheads against the finished arrows . we share 50 to 50 . &quot;
there are places on this island where they can make all three or four miles on a new language .
if 27 individuals put out of these 27 member of these 27 member of their favorite member , their 23 languages say , they just say a little bit of a force that they need to be prepared to be used to all the kinds of energy options .
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that they also have language .
and what most interested in me is the invisible space between a text and the shocking picture , and how the image is transformed through the text , and the text through the picture .
this is the most popular , which is the reason that we &apos;re running across the atlantic ocean and connecting north america .
it &apos;s negative to turn it .
but by the sense of the experience of the , , the most powerful , and the most remote , the most powerful thing is that the internet changes .
larry ornish was sitting a 10 years of a half a half a year sentence , in arizona , for kidnapping and repeat of a fellow boy , and he &apos;s a young boy on a computer scanner .
and the people are left to themselves .
and they &apos;ve taken them for us for texas .
and now they drive with the food with where they &apos;re in this moment .
it &apos;s just the length of space that makes it look like nothing .
so something called hooked to a sense of feeling : the pursuit of happiness and human design .
partly that &apos;s the legacy of the legacy , the convergence of the pursuit of happiness for the pursuit of happiness , it &apos;s driven by the most profitable aspects of the individual , and can &apos;t be found in reality .
a key thing in science is that happiness and bad is not a dent in a sealed continuum .
it starts in the most competitive .
here &apos;s a three year-old baby .
in the animal kingdom , there &apos;s only one way to increase the status that is dominance .
i want to close with some quotes .
why should you choose rats ?
once the rat got this , we got a little more difficult to the task .
you can actually cure t.b. , even in humans who are hiv-positive .
with the knowledge that a patient who stays out to the microscopic , until 15 people infected -- 15 healthy people -- one year , can be safe that we &apos;ve saved a lot of lives .
here we see neurons .
so , it &apos;s important for imitation and emulation .
now , the question : if i just watch how a different person is being touched , why am i not confused and literally watching this kind of thing from the naked watch , how someone is being touched ?
thank you . i have two missions here today .
i &apos;m not really about the most popular , but it &apos;s about the pollen itself .
all these pictures were taken by a scanning microscope by the way in the lab by kew b.c.
even every single one of us has a story to tell the most common story of us .
we have to be so good as the breast cancer campaign to address this crisis .
right at the time , in the 1980s when we were running women and death through heart disease , they wrote a marker for the new england journal of medicine and called this syndrome .
our colleagues in washington , d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
unlike the , x-ray , x-ray , for women whose high school , who &apos;s a high heart of the heart , every time we organize something that includes a little amount of radiation , we ask , &quot; is this test really necessary ? &quot;
okay , here we have started .
they &apos;ve done what they said , they &apos;ve kept them , and they were trained .
the cells have something like the kind of plastic , and in the dish , they don &apos;t care about themselves .
what does that mean for us ?
in the course of three , eight to 10 hours , we took eight to 10 hours of oil , collected a million hours of oil and a million hours of oil .
this is one of the first offshore projects that came out of a year ago , which really surprised us .
and finally , my son plays in a walker .
three of the most important people in this project philip , tipper , and 14,000 roy , and 14,000 roy .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamic in the game .
this is the first time that our son did more than two steps on once -- caught in the movie .
and this is a major question to be a question , because the better we understand how the brain is generating , the better we can communicate . i think the better we can think about it , and we can work .
it &apos;s a kind of center where you see a picture and think , &quot; oh ! i &apos;ve been looking at a strong or emotional response to that . &quot;
what we literally do is to paint our teams the whole world &apos;s entire gas system on a big wall .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just about hygiene , but also to the possibility of relaxation .
so it doesn &apos;t build there .
if you translated that into the building industry , if you have a car company , and a window is broken , we say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken , that must be fixed .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we &apos;ve got to put it on .
are we just stupid ?
you may be able to walk through two years a day when you read eight hours a day .
so you can get in september , and say , &quot; i &apos;m important today .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
and the police waiting for the nobel fire system to make the vehicle in pieces of the driver to get the body of the driver .
and that &apos;s enough to be in the present of the united states , where a eye is being held in the divine condition .
all of this leads us to -- the more , just to name the one , which is what we do most of the time , digital devices .
this is the consequence of the destruction of more than a third of the brain on the right , through the stroke .
this is a very , very low level to get released from the health system .
he would hold my jaw in the right position while he was blowing my teeth .
alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator , who is fascinated with the gaps of the conscious , whether he &apos;s a deaf hearing hearing the hearing , or a blind , or a paralyzed , the movement .
now i had to go in the dark years , which followed me , what was left when everything was particularly done today .
and it works . it works .
lp : so if you have the opportunity to spend time with simon .
and these were the developing countries : they had great families and a relatively short life .
and these are on this side . a big overlap of africa and the most .
and then deng xiaoping came and brought money to china and brought the country back to a middle .
a search tool that we can copy the data in a field of design and publish the world , and what do we hear when we look around ?
but this creates hypotheses .
you know , darwin has explained life after it came , what was the essence of life ?
and i learned francis crick .
but there was what in the literature .
we were not the best chemist in the room .
i was chosen ; my girl married me .
you can compare the same dna in the same way that you can see dna and the other parts of it .
and so i close , by telling you that we &apos;ve looked at 20 people with schizophrenia .
average costs in a case that the defense of two million dollars , and it takes 18 months when they win .
first , they don &apos;t fight for the patent , but they &apos;re not fighting against the patent .
my solution : give me this patent and i &apos;ll let you go back with a little bit of time .
&quot; why not ? &quot; said the girls .
the fathers were in a place where they move their daughters to play their chairs , their chairs to reach their hand .
this is a great technology .
it &apos;s not very much left on the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in humans .
can the enemy not see most of the time , and so we needed a different approach to eradicate polio than we had done with smallpox .
it helped control pandemic food , to the example of sars .
the reality of polio today is something very different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : now bruce , where are you from the view of the most difficult places ?
bruce paravicini : how we get polio to kill polio
dj : we found this kangaroo now at all kinds of animals , especially with the cats .
and to our surprise , it became a computer factory .
for us , this elephant in many ways has become a symbol of inspiration , a symbol of that hope that we accompanied with our work .
it was incredibly amazing than she took it in safety to protect it before the hyena .
and of course , if i look at these online companies that became the most elegant , it reminds me of a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic because your fate is in our hand .
we need it . we respect and celebrate each other as a man and woman as a community and as part of this planet and we need to continue to do it .
and it seems obvious to be obvious that the earth is large and remain , the sun is small and flexible . but it &apos;s worth remembering what &apos;s going on to be a dent .
and that &apos;s because in middle middle world , the market is always there .
nature is this model of this , which is the kind of animal we are .
because there &apos;s so many of them , and because of them , there &apos;s no consensus about their favorite , more than they &apos;re in the middle of their favorite , as we see it in middle world , and it &apos;s been synonymous .
people as a machines may be scientifically , and it &apos;s a scientific time , but it &apos;s a health force , but it &apos;s a health force , if you guess what the person is going to do next .
over night , i became the captain of the day of 40 years old .
over a cursor i control with my head , i allow these extra pieces of data to see videos from the robot and sending orders to a dive of a stick of mine .
with the help of people like you , we can do this dream .
in the formation of oceanography , a security system is developed by the design of the state of the world by basically the most vulnerable , which is the dolphins sending them out .
i think we can form a global community .
this is a hot piano ring .
there are now some -- there are some lessons that you can learn from it .
but usually we don &apos;t do this .
i think we tend to look at this : the infrastructure of globalization .
this is now down 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem that we need to solve .
i also take that most of you don &apos;t speak chinese , which is really sad when you think that this is the number of language in the internet .
what do you look at ? maybe we should do that .
if you look at this picture , maybe you think , &quot; why should i even care about that ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow you to go back and look back and find the world to find out its place .
they would bring wealth and security , religious violence , and make sure that states never put terrorists back again .
and part of this activity is honesty .
what is that ?
i love this dish .
and the war was occupied , the 20 million people who took life -- until today , the u.s. war is the world &apos;s life .
marcel sen , who is this guy : &quot; i also made all this money , but i spent all this time for the american man to be stolen , who had stolen my recipe .
chinese restaurants have done the same thing , i would argue , with the menu and the decoration -- even the restaurant name -- but without a centralized headquarters .
in contrast , we have general tso chicken , which began in new york city in the early 1970s , as i just started at university in new york city in the early 1970s , so ...
so what we see in the 17th 18th century is the most powerful search for medicine to be the same thing .
so people would have a really big twist .
when the hunters started , less than becoming more depressed , i was clearly getting more depressed until i thought my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
remember , as a child , to have a child on every line ?
18 and 19 , i was going to sleep through the night .
and again , i &apos;ll be depressed and some embarrassment .
many of us realize that there are much more to do in the next few years in the world .
he goes around , &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know . where did the world work with the treatment of the familiar problems that made out of the potential of the earthquake and climate change ?
if you animate the impossible , you can do it .
but we have a deal to climate change .
and there &apos;s god .
the most remarkable power is something that makes it really remarkable : it uses two ingredients , proteins and water that are in their limbic , to create a material that is very hard to make a material as a substitute .
or you &apos;re a beautiful thing like this , if the camera can catch this .
here you see , it &apos;s being recorded by the tissue .
with my new project , marilyn &apos;s ted , i want to use art for that , to create technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that &apos;s drawn to the united states and drawing the food and the most responsible -- hopefully not to help him meet some of his next decisions .
what do i do ? &quot;
in the frame of this , unprecedented demonstration of heather knight , a data , a more powerful , more than more than a more , more than a more cosmopolitan -- he collects the feedback of the crowd , and it &apos;s going to work the answers to the
stanley tarter , inventor of the famous &quot; police &quot; of the world &apos;s famous , held in the corporate and the most responsible , that there were two of the people a connection about only five to seven steps .
how does our view of relationships have to be very different groups ?
there was a exchange that i &apos;m going to tell you , and where he might have been able to put this cartoon into the ear .
um ... my dad , a cat company ?
it was his father who decided she needed wrong papers .
this feeling of responsibility about other people &apos;s life , despite the other ages , he had his fault , and his fault , a more successful , because he was out of a camp , he kept his whole life .
and as my half met and my favorite , i had given a way of orphans , writing my father &apos;s wrong papers .
i asked him , the victim he had had if he ever had the most popular .
we grow from a few million people to the seven billion people that we are today .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a very , a very beautiful , a plastic system on the top of the next , which is a very good state of the next , which seems to be in a good state .
if you &apos;re going to go through the forests of the land , you &apos;re actually thriving , you &apos;re actually thriving , to stay stable .
with the realization of the most powerful , fishermen , the most powerful barrier reef , and scientists , that the great barrier reef is damn the current barrier of the current day .
but the drama is of course that it &apos;s clear that the change is not an option .
and that leads me to another reason why i &apos;m here today : because i really like media all kinds of things .
this is a kind of a race of a race of far developed .
and he &apos;s actually using a ancient way of making the design , and connected to this three-dimensional perspective , which was a whole new technology that was at this time .
and by the process of sugar , i put portraits on black , i &apos;m portraits of them .
it was very large pictures , and i took them with a very large camera , a little bit of a camera camera .
my interest in the most powerful , especially worse , is enough .
on the back , a sequence is also the chimps .
we can ask , is there a general difference between africans and environmental services ?
and then you can compare to the genome of living today .
we can then ask ourselves for the herbivores that are like neanderthals , and they have mixed with the ancestors today ?
there are many people who designed their own vision of the future , like this vision of the 20th century .
after my belief , the plane of the future has his own consciousness .
imagine , a carbon nut in a 3d printer , and are embedded in a field of a pool , and follow the forces that occur in your components .
they weren &apos;t talking . but especially they were very isolated from the world around them , from their environment and from the people .
they would be able to call them . they would call the police .
now we know that it &apos;s about a 100 .
you see a video .
you have the feeling that research has been , you know , the effect of the reality that you can actually have , that you can actually prevent these experiences with that in the way that i started to get my journey on this area .
then you mark .
you &apos;re going to put your mind in a stare body -- chin on the top of the body , arms extended over your body .
they were doing everything like us to teach them .
and after the battle , they bring this mobile lecture and they make what you call &quot; the &quot; s &quot; to teach you what you &apos;ve done wrong .
the people have changed .
i said , &quot; where is he ? &quot;
that &apos;s not a piece .
and she showed up on the left , to tell me how problematic this picture was , which it was for you to be the idea of how black it was .
it &apos;s really in this sense of the fact that i have a new series of questions that i have .
well , this is a kind of obvious statement .
and the kids said , &quot; how do we do that . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to multiply numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long do you do it before you decided that you didn &apos;t understand anything ? &quot;
their favorite levels of school increased to 50 , which is the fine schools that are going to be done with a biotechnology biotechnology , a biotechnology civilization .
76 percent . at the test , two months later , the result was 76 percent .
after eight , he wanted to be a video da professor , da vinci .
these are 10-year-old .
suddenly , i looked out of the dark side of the way the opposite side of the space was a computer accident that was mapped by the moon .
if i had to reduce the whole story on a picture , what would it be ?
i &apos;m going to show you some clips from my other big project in this year , and the tempest -- the tempest -- the storm -- the storm -- the storm .
and our little life ends up in a sleep .
bono : they are swollen .
i know that you understand that .
so blue , blue , everything was blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both play in africa .
it &apos;s another one that acts on the interface of health and business .
let &apos;s use the markets as the most successful , which we have , and figuring out what price people would pay for , so they would have the choice .
thank you .
the main problem was , if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we destroyed two main sets of research and 10 tv .
the little bit of the web to take out of his tracks , and that was a problem .
this is very good . it &apos;s going to slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of a few of the models that i work with .
tissue from the wireless density and behavior is the second part , and that &apos;s actually going to be the key to the design of these models for the creation of the system .
thank you .
and trying to fly it just to the end of the way that we &apos;re going to take a arrow with the bottom end of the end , it was hard work , and young , young , boy , i &apos;ve learned a lot of respect for nature .
now let &apos;s look at the other side .
we work on projects -- even more sophisticated developments , as much as the steel , as a result of the world , the darpa institute of technology , of technology , and the university of the university of technology .
be careful , you just behave like wood or something like wood .
now i didn &apos;t try to be more competitive .
they go over forever .
these are about two billion .
it takes him for the most , &quot; three years of oil . &quot;
don &apos;t forget that one for a second .
but for me , this is great because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time that we can live in the human mind and machines .
i clearly realized , what &apos;s it ?
it &apos;s to be a way that the way that it could be in the wild could be extinct in 20 to 30 years .
all the evidence on this is that this cancer is being transmitted by one virus .
i took the opportunity to get a few samples out of jonas &apos; tumor and a few samples from other parts .
she brought him to the counter and this discovered something called a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a time .
and ultimately , cancer is a inevitable consequence of the ability of our cells to share and adapt to their environment .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and this is a global phenomenon .
they would be able to wait to wait .
and that &apos;s the third reason why a low expectation doesn &apos;t make us happy .
but they didn &apos;t think the numbers were on them .
first , i &apos;m going to show you the most popular for optimism .
but the good news is that our illusion is not broken , if we &apos;re aware of this kind of thing .
but what we &apos;re going to see in the 21st century is asia , which is gradually back , to get more than half of the world &apos;s population and to do about half the global economic economy .
you could look at this as the privatization of the war .
after 1958 had the soviets , it was like , &quot; this is the end of america . &quot;
if you live in japan or new delhi or a new school , your view of china will be something different than if you live in beijing .
and if we &apos;re going to have strategies in which we &apos;re going to get this in bigger historical context , we &apos;re able to do this process .
how do we define our national interests so that it &apos;s not just a single amount of light .
this is the conventional approach .
this has typically the responsibility to the drug supply of the way that we have a stable energy supply .
they depend on each other .
jobs for who ? especially for young men .
after the law collapsed , you can &apos;t even get access to life .
the food would be supported by the conflict , and government would be empowered .
this is the silhouette of my hometown new orleans .
the military has realized it . they call climate change , security and stability , while governments are discussing in the world , as governments are .
it allows you to become more productive , so you can afford the insurance to be able to get yourself .
these are certainly inspiring examples of possible solutions , if we &apos;re able to feel in the way that we &apos;re able to plan to plan out of the world .
listen like chinese students in english by shouting it .
teacher : perfect ! students : perfect !
and that includes things like the concrete world with a drug model , to make abstractions that we try to make logical consistent , and we also take the hypothetical seriously , which is , we &apos;re more likely to ask what &apos;s going on .
luria looked at people before they were in the scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to a disclaimer of the concrete world .
there said luria : &quot; on the north pole there &apos;s always snow .
they chose ballot ones rather than new york .
it wasn &apos;t just the spread of cognitively intense professions .
would you have made it , getting killed ? &quot;
you could say a half , a half .
it feels like i landed in a colony of angels . &quot;
and they &apos;re looking at me , a degree in something .
it &apos;s still in the red numbers , but chris managed to have personal sacrifice , this film .
i &apos;m a of her favorite .
there &apos;s a prime minister , a minister of defense , shopping and a cfo , or president of the orchestra .
boy : the average thing is serious .
we were all angry to them : &quot; why do you do that ?
that &apos;s going to be a lot of real , if you read it . &quot;
we &apos;ve always been playing the game for weeks after the school , about seven weeks , and we &apos;ve been able to overcome all 50 crises .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
many people announced good paid jobs , and they closed the internet .
it &apos;s like his own little connection .
if i all get three legs out of this , in the three peaks of the triangle , i would get a tetrahedron .
so everything you do is -- it &apos;s a very reactive proposition -- this old plastic , and this old plastic &#91; unclear &#93; , this is a very simple thing to do in a old world .
this is possible if you have a whole piece of paper , you can enjoy paper -- you can be in a school school or a school school -- a piece of a scanner , a ruler , a ruler , no scissors , no scissors .
what we do is a very simple diagnostic system .
this is a little rubber tube , which is the way that you &apos;re doing this , it &apos;s going to be like a mirror machine .
here are two magnets .
it was very many passengers on the ship , and it was boring , so the captain invited them to be a deck .
in the middle conference , arvind gupta shows the very simple plans , but amazing plans to actually transform waste in really , really , constructed toys , which can build children themselves -- as they learn basic principles of science and design .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually examples of biology that many clues were provided .
and there are some examples of projects that are really trying to mimic ecosystems .
and with a little planning , we can be dominated a space of traffic in a field that provides open space for people who are bringing people back to food and to bring waste into opportunities in opportunities .
this photo was done at the end of the day , and only one year later , it looked like this .
if you &apos;re poisoning seawater , the first thing is calcium carbonate .
no , you have to be able to explore the human souls with visions of a hundred yards . &quot;
i was looking for somebody who &apos;s jewish because i &apos;m jewish and because i &apos;m very important .
but the real failure was that there were a lot of men who wanted to go with me .
very few of us have the ability to be absolutely honest with themselves .
he likes to travel as long as it &apos;s not on a horse .
i was basically trying to be like being a little bit of a bow .
because you remember my favorite , you have to get a more free of 700 points and no one did this .
most of you . players are 33 years old , not eight years , and if we look at the most profound demographics of the oil , the players are older adults .
imagine that your vision is very , very good .
and these players even have many other benefits in terms of attention , and one aspect of attention , which is also more powerful , is our ability to track objects in our environment .
i want to ask you to remember this outcome , and it &apos;s in the context of another group of the user group , a group that actually looked at the society in our society that is out of people who are doing the gharial .
let me explain this one thing with a task that calls mental rotating .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just do all kinds of programs that we &apos;re looking at , running around .
so it was a big , very complex project that i didn &apos;t even have , whether it works at all .
so wolfram alpha knows about many and lots of things .
on the one hand , we have mathematica , with the kind of precise , tunisian language and a large network of the potential capacity , capable of doing a lot of lines of power .
so , with physical physics , we &apos;re basically used to go to the world and see that certain materials make sense of certain technological purposes and so on .
a few years ago , i was pretty excited about discovery that there are candidates of universes that are successful , which are successful , and also the general relativity and gravity and the evidence of quantum relativity and gravity and evidence on quantum mechanics .
sw : i think .
and during that time i lost more relatives , and teachers , who are chasing me , to hiv / aids .
they jump up . they wear red clothes .
because my mother was a woman , she didn &apos;t have a right to land , and automatically everything , which my family had , anyway , had the right .
and the day before the actual ceremony we were dancing , and they were very excited , and they didn &apos;t sleep all night .
he wore the sneakers and that in a village that didn &apos;t even have the streets of roads . it did very attractive .
i promised him to be a girl , i would come back and do everything they would ask me about .
when it was pregnant before the marriage , the mother was made for it , and punished .
as we speak here , 125 girls will never get upset again .
consumers who represent 72 percent of the american gdp actually begin , just like banks and companies , and they were paying out their favorite , their favorite , in everyday life , themselves , themselves , to free themselves from obligations and risks that are going on .
and what you see here is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we actually step and basically step in future education , the future children of our homes .
and the way to get is to be 48 percent , at cornell institute .
we &apos;re also watching a trend to something called tourism . right ?
one of them is the most popular of community and neighborhood , and it &apos;s the emphasis of the neighbors as a support .
we also observe a big amount of research .
the trend for the design is tremendous .
then we take the phenomenon of kogi .
and then the question came to me , i &apos;m the only one that &apos;s doing this ?
you could exploit them .
this is what i do in my life -- stories tell me , and i &apos;m telling you a few stories , and today i want to share with you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures that are the most powerful .
our main community could shrink . our hearts could be blinded . and our environmental companies could be a lot of the time , if we keep in our cultural field of life .
and i came up with the first time i call it , &quot; representative foreigners . &quot;
i &apos;m not an immigrant , no refugee or a refugee , and i &apos;m going to ask , why do i do that , but the treaty between languages allows me to invent myself .
he wanted to see an manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story became a huge deal , because i was denied .
literature has to lead to the other side .
i could be a novel about an muslim woman , and maybe it will become happy , and i may write a happy book in my next book , and i may write a bloody professor in norway .
so you &apos;re going to be able to get existing songs , you cut out in small bits , you can get these pieces , put it together , and you get a new song , but it &apos;s clearly a new song , but it &apos;s clearly from old
instead , these laws and laws are actually more comfortable compared to the property .
it &apos;s a key system , but i &apos;m going to conclude , what it jumps out . the name of the telephone , which is the telephone of the telephone , by putting a symbol with his finger .
our creativity comes from the outside , not from inside .
and then they say , &quot; okay , but how do you see your address ? &quot;
but it &apos;s actually not my fault ; it &apos;s from the guardian &quot; guardian . &quot;
what &apos;s beautiful is you can probably see this limb there , a kind of a kind of a kind of a plastic set of plastic that &apos;s just moving out of the limb .
our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
now , this led to a understanding of nuclear structure , because it &apos;s going to be so versatile that atoms have a single core , with the brain molecules that circle it into .
this picture shows a galaxy , a solar system , with , you know , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think it can eventually be the most powerful ideas for us , about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet .
this is here . this is home . that &apos;s what we &apos;re .
and with every mouse and every touch of the screen , we let the screen and mercury &apos;s personal information all over our way through our own way through the digital forest .
when our daughter sat down at the university of the day , i asked them , &quot; will you put a lot of value on musical competence ? &quot;
we can &apos;t use the internet policy on this too .
well , i want to take you to this journey .
and because i was doing so much and i talked to my 27 birthday , i decided i would not talk to you any day , just a day .
and they don &apos;t talk .
and i explained to help a friend who understood my sign that i was john francis , i was living through life , that i was not talking to myself , and that &apos;s the last time that someone would translate my sign .
well , i &apos;m going to get my backpack again .
i started talking again because i had studied my research .
but the most popular thing was that i thought i thought about every birthday about my silence , but never about my decision , just to use my feet .
born and grew up in north korea .
sometimes i found small jobs in exchange against food .
i always worried that i would get married and back .
i felt so powerless because i had to eat so much in america , but my father died of hunger .
but i believe that their gesture of love and care can save the lives of another joseph , and can change thousands of other people who have still to survive , to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings , but this was much stronger than i had expected , and making lightly flawed , and as an industrial industrial system , also to make it as a result of the world .
but then i was very disappointed with my profession as an architect , because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for society , but for privileged people , rich , the government , services .
and then in 1995 , in 1995 , there was a big earthquake in kobe in japan .
so i wonder what is a permanent building , and what a temporary building ?
but this is really needed .
so we learn some of the most important things in our lives before we &apos;re born , in the womb .
so fetuses even learn the specific language that &apos;s going to be talked about in the world that they &apos;re born in .
it creates a mixture of the influences that are so objective and curious , as the woman itself .
why should malnutrition care about the womb ?
you can also see the other eyes with other eyes .
this confidence in the field of the world is essential to each kind of plastic .
the audience will be on the street , which is very logical , but not with the conclusion , what &apos;s happening in front of your eyes . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , maybe it &apos;s going to be the smile .
you may remember that as the most popular , okay . when the biggest deal of all time .
if you &apos;re a high animal in the formal , and someone says , &quot; what do you actually do for the hunger of hunger in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start a campaign campaign ?
this is actually a strategy and i argue that strategy is playing a role .
for me , all the music was .
now , if i use my software , the camera is the most responsible , and i think the point of the space of the car is going to be the most profitable thing , and you &apos;ve got a immune system .
i remember that the poor needed something more profound -- food , clothing , shelter -- whatever they didn &apos;t have .
i even felt a close one of shame .
now , i heard him , i was excited for various reasons .
i didn &apos;t even ask a donation , which was usually my way .
it &apos;s about the most popular of the history of the poor and it &apos;s about giving a chance to engage , which is what their dignity would confirm , a partnership , which is a partnership that is based on a traditional way of donation , can happen .
it &apos;s a very broad combination , a very strong combination .
now , the first time it &apos;s very at the beginning , it &apos;s very , very clear , for me , that it &apos;s just a vehicle , just a tool .
what does the future of humanity look like ?
now , i turn to the second big question : are we alone or there &apos;s other lives in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions is that we &apos;ve done remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
see this .
here &apos;s photographs of me .
the rate of all 18 months , and every single one of the most successful member of the world &apos;s population , is that this is moore &apos;s law .
but what about them ? what about doing it ?
they sail in their verbal pad , and occasionally they would throw people for experiments , which would not agree their parents .
so we &apos;re interested in things like this .
and the previous generations couldn &apos;t do these experiments at all .
and i found out that the first technology was revealed by the world &apos;s first technology in the form of the world &apos;s form of mass design .
we can learn a lot about it .
and i look at the , and i &apos;m trying to protect my child because you can &apos;t do anything for a child , you don &apos;t have a minister .
and secondly , she tells us that she had a ph.d. , but some of the streams of trees had to climb up .
so , until we got our ancestors , we have the most effective people in the principle of adults , because the fossils that are missing , they &apos;re missing .
the most powerful thing about the world &apos;s favorite is exploring the origin of humanity in the vast ethiopia , and he talks about how he found the oldest skeleton of a humanoid child , and what we can learn about our humanity .
and if all of the rules are supposed to be , you need an effective system to address and the delivery system , and as we &apos;ve noticed , it &apos;s all necessary to be done in all of the trust .
it &apos;s considered a high seas , because the continent of the world &apos;s demands was known by the .
we need to work locally , but also the whole oil system .
we need to create a new paradigm of caution and respect .
carol &apos;s favorite says , &quot; i would pay to do what i do . &quot;
and that was a pretty good idea .
so , to say , i &apos;m a journalist , i &apos;m a journalist , so i want to design a sketch , like the present and the future .
and then , finally , i think we need to think about whether we want to think that our reality is going to be -- and if , what it means for our idea of life and everything that comes out .
it looks like oil .
the symptoms of complex is that you have the strong and you have a strong sense of thinking , the right solution , no matter how hard the problem is .
cesar and i tried to write a paper for the new york times , and explain how it works .
of course , we can .
and make a lot of money .
it &apos;s a higher than the rate of the americans .
we &apos;re going to try . probably all the time .
immediately , it &apos;s going on . &quot;
and then , in a time , it was always trying to prove it , but he could never prove the guess .
i &apos;m saying that our approach is simply not acceptable .
china has been able to have achieved this in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even slow down .
the future is naturally balanced .
yes , it &apos;s getting ugly , and yes , it &apos;s happening , with certainty in our lifetime -- but we &apos;re more than able to overcome everything that &apos;s on us .
and here they come in .
and what we need to think about is this : if you &apos;re in the flames , what &apos;s next ?
and we thought we can put these debt on our children , but imagine you &apos;re going to be in front of us .
everything else is a lot of the world .
this is the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what stage is the cell &apos;s cell .
that should be amazing or ?
everything we get is a lot of the time .
you will be able to focus your listening , maybe you can be able to get the sensitivity or you can &apos;t be able to do a series of things that we can &apos;t .
it &apos;s not a thousand years in the distant .
we should have this cheap , simple , simple , not to use them for their children . &quot;
and here we can see this whole factor .
we can &apos;t risk to lose the confidence of the customers .
he only got 500 and you could have gotten 500 . &quot;
and he had a huge host of plastic , which they got , and he said , &quot; come back in a week , when they &apos;re still sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the way of the web -- things we all talk about -- is a little less than 5,000 days old .
of course , there &apos;s the internet for more than 5,000 days -- but the web only 5,000 days .
so if we say that the machine we &apos;re going to be a human brain is now a human brain , if we look at the rate of that , that is in 30 years six billion years of oil .
now it &apos;s not like that -- if you do a chart and things in work , a word , you &apos;re not part of the web , but you &apos;re going to be it . you &apos;ll be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people will be the extended senses of the machine . &quot; in a sense .
it &apos;s going to be on the level of the parts or ideas or words , if you want to evaporate .
the last point i wanted to talk about is the idea that we &apos;re going to be going to be a lot of the idea .
third , it will be ubiquitous , it will fill our entire environment and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i was convinced that the second of jesus was going to be the second of jesus christ , that it was sun &apos;s moon , and i &apos;ve been prepared specifically by god , and i was prepared to be done by god .
these are the dead deaths .
and it allows everything . it makes everything sense .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas , how we divide things together .
this is a project that we &apos;ve done in a very large fashion program for a huge computer that came out of this process , it &apos;s the result of a variety of forces that are developing it .
and that led directly to another project .
it &apos;s actually a false attitude , because the hybrid is probably more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas are doing the education process for the young people .
and finally , one of the most interesting projects -- a more powerful .
each of you is going to be in your neighbors .
so we have school fees .
so we have a big brain , a big advantage , because we can affect our environment .
my story , the two brains , is the two brains , it may have been surprising to our gut .
this is a very , very important thing , because there can be gunpowder .
we &apos;ve learned to talk to the big brain , taste and reward , as you know .
he said , &quot; you know , eventually , we were all like animals and then not anymore . &quot;
these are men and women who can still name 250 stars in the night sky .
of course , the u.s. union has said that .
the street , the post , the post , is actually a very , very crude , which is constantly reflected light , which appears to be the sacred picchu of machu picchu , which seems to be called the hood picchu .
if you pray for the dead , you do with the hands of these gestures , with those that you &apos;re thinking about in the sky , spiders .
here &apos;s the place where the big mother has the most powerful mother in the world who created the mountains and created the country , which they call the heart of the world .
it &apos;s unique to human imagination .
this material you all know , is the most ambiguous , but i think it &apos;s more of toxic white stuff .
i shot in there , you fit there , because in a hundred years , my body can go back to the earth .
it &apos;s a waste .
you want to apply it anywhere in the world , and not to take care of it or not to take care of it , because you have lots of alternatives .
first , they start atoms in a special bottle .
i &apos;ve launched a competition four years ago called &quot; dance your ph.d. &quot;
my country is in total of 15 trillion dollars .
and that &apos;s -- -- that &apos;s still a lot more sophisticated than all the speakers and all the ones that come to me .
and she thought about my work in mathematical models , which should be a understanding of evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience may not be head-tail-tail -- from deep , cultural reasons , they think it &apos;s boring -- and find a different pattern much more interesting -- head-tail-head .
you can think about two ways .
if you throw a coin , you get a series of head and number .
back to more secular , because of that , you &apos;re looking at uncertainty .
and only in one percent is wrong .
he &apos;s like , &quot; i &apos;m going to take that one sudden death penalty in a family , the likelihood of another one . &quot;
not as unlikely as one in 73 million , but yet pretty unlikely .
the whole control of the way that has the smallest impact on the industrial process is carried by statistics .
the most powerful one may have saved hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide .
a smart power plant prevents injury because the electricity is always recognized , until a smart diagnostic system is recognized .
but , on the other hand , china is a computer &apos;s worth of light . it &apos;s a term from a natural gas system .
you have facebook , we have a lot of the time .
yet , the oyster itself can create a very strong force , which is never in the history of china .
so , chinese look at this kind of thing as a real medium , not just as a mere demographic .
how a big ted , isn &apos;t it ?
so in the last three years , in the last three years , through the world &apos;s worth of ice , they really changed more and more transparent because they don &apos;t have access to the data .
more chinese , and human rights , and human rights as you have an artful privilege , instead of an asian privilege .
many of you know that the beethoven &apos;s seventh symphony was .
i don &apos;t say that they can live a wonderful life .
girl : well , my sister can be pretty nerves .
the acoustics of music is much more complicated than the language .
this is a violin .
and it seems like his favorite , the way his favorite , to try to try to get the cause of death , why it was a sound that was made up and his skull has been pulled out to the pages .
cl : joseph is phenomenal . it &apos;s brilliant .
when i &apos;m going to be a , in this particular auditorium , i see a special audience .
in many countries , it &apos;s a different thing .
at this point in the dutch story , my father was at the bank of the river river near the south of the river river .
the rate of civil wars and oppression has been down since the end of the cold war .
my soldiers use their weapons as tools of peace .
peter van : why i took a gun
this program gets a form and then then we turn 250 sensors .
this is a computer factory in the middle of the mainland , in the middle of the mainland .
you can &apos;t let it be cool .
i &apos;m very interested in both of them .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example of this , but there &apos;s actually a theoretical argument for why technology is developing in a fashion way .
now , evolution of our species needed hundreds of thousands of years , and because of this interaction , evolution is basically a new diagnostic technology , to produce the next stage , which was the first step in the technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; we can do good the third dimension .
over the last 50 years , we had 28 percent of the year in the technology system , and we had a total growth of the growth of the year .
another big revolution is the most powerful revolution .
in order to get our exponential growth from computing : 1,000 dollars on computing is about the brain of a insect or a mouse .
and in the year of the world , we will get the full of the entire , the entire amount of extinction , and you have to be surprised , how often the bullshit has opened in the form of technology -- faster and faster when we get to this
you can get blessing and the timber .
they &apos;re harder .
they were removed from the street .
because there &apos;s nothing in it . well , it &apos;s not supposed to be there .
dopamine seems to be the fabric that is linked to the internet .
and then we call that schizophrenia .
and he was so friendly to post and give us the resolution .
i mentioned in our little thought of thought , and they &apos;re a recovering in the african plain .
the 11th of september has a computer company . it &apos;s a conspiracy .
and we have our own online , and we have a product of a product .
i wasn &apos;t so good as he did , but we managed to do it , the poster , the champagne chapman , and bruce chapman and bruce chapman , and bruce chapman on a street service , and that was a great experience .
they always said , &quot; and they said the truth &quot; and beat us .
musicians and activist peter gabriel shares his personal motivation , with the most powerful , with human rights , and telling stories of active food issues .
so , next we asked ourselves , how do they do that ?
he recognizes the problem and knowing it , and the dance is his body &apos;s dance , which allows him to orient .
the beetle is running much less rare on the pill when they &apos;re wearing the air , when they don &apos;t wear .
here &apos;s our favorite experimenter .
play a computer game and see what happens .
this is the universe of stephen hawking .
thank you .
the argument that it &apos;s fun is that it &apos;s fun to fall into this big adventure , not quite with my experience .
or , &quot; beautiful . you know , my grandmother makes a cruise next year to antarctica .
so the whole thing of the presentation that crutches is to convince you that they &apos;re the entrepreneurs they &apos;re going to invest in and a lot of money .
and next to the experience , a company , or to lead something -- that doesn &apos;t have to be a company .
there &apos;s no financially genetically in the same way that there was no trouble .
from there , you take them -- on a solid , neat path up to the top . right from the beginning .
if i know somebody who made a device that &apos;s made of this device .
no , they &apos;re not .
then you give me a quick kind of breathing .
even if the competition works for the master pattern ...
it was all positive , and it was positive , positive , positive , positive .
if you follow my premise , you &apos;ll have a very reactive talk , very , very , very , very , great presentation , which is to bring them and make emotional .
i didn &apos;t know that , that &apos;s pretty cool .
statistically , one of them is a beetle .
if you &apos;re imitating something , you might have an effect on it .
and then if you have enough , you can click another link .
we &apos;re at the end of the table , on the last place as the culture , innovation .
so we think and we behave , we break our energy system .
we have a meme meme -- to be serious .
but forgive me , the problems today are not the problems of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the largest killer planners ?
it &apos;s very grim .
our thinking is backwards .
by a drastic change , change , like transparency , change like this , for example , and collaboration , and collaboration , and not to promote these things , are focused on results .
because only the challenge is the only way that things are made for us , the only way for us to get rid of the old onion , and to find new creative solutions for the problems today .
because we can &apos;t do it alone . we should do it together , and if we do that , and the ideas of play , we can transform bulgaria to something better .
the magazine for the name is called &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master took me to the ted room , because the most successful was in the back of it .
after i had a gesture of the way to go out , they were very -- i was accepted and i worked there about six months .
nine days ago , i had a fire .
you know -- all of the stuff .
my kids , the , the henry and henry .
we &apos;re making a lot of magazines , we made our homework , but where we were also looking , we were surrounded by images like this .
this picture literally came in seconds , after the baby was placed in the arms and i got over .
rg : oh oh .
av : taboo number three : you don &apos;t talk about his dictators -- but i &apos;m going to talk today about my talk today .
the general opinion is that every aspect of my life has become better , and i &apos;ve been born to the wonder of birth and family .
but you realize that you &apos;re going to be able to lose control of a wonderful way , which is how we mean , our life very much , and what is very satisfying .
rg + av + av : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s a consequence of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve all seen the star star , with the most successful .
imagine , big , already late , already late , as you would play , and john &apos;s walker shows how pictures are based on the exact head and analyzed the footage to be able to play on the surface of the glass .
now , we &apos;ve been in a time of extraordinary economic growth , the longest industrial growth in the history of this country .
but now , a few months later , how good politicians are still going to be in the pen , &quot; in the acidic apple , without the mine , &quot; as someone turned out , their uncertainty , they can &apos;t hide their uncertainty .
well , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i met this guy , and then i was a little bit messy , slightly chaotic man who gave up of tomato sauce and meaningless for completely immunized .
but interestingly , it &apos;s a future that is a future where society is going to be a few tricks from capitalism , which is how to optimize dna to the society , by trying to get the dna out of the world by trying to do things and then
i want to share with you a fascinating new hypothesis , and some surprising new insights that i &apos;ve been working on , about the relationship between the structure of language that you &apos;re talking about , and your propensity to save .
and if i want to talk right , it &apos;s forces me to think about it constantly .
well , this is a key theory .
please push this device so that you can be able to adjust with your dominant hand , so i can measure your own color .
it &apos;s the current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important the ability to communicate about generations .
we are english teachers all over the way .
but i &apos;m about using them as a way to use .
but they didn &apos;t get the results that they wanted .
at the same time , i was on the field of the art of the university of the day , although i was a ph.d. in indianapolis .
people and the milky estate and the world and the birds and all the red line here are going up . these are people , livestock and pets .
we focused on serious energy technology , and we produced products for the company .
let &apos;s see the next video .
this was the last night on the party , and -- you can see how it just covers , and you can see it , you can see it .
and he was dissatisfied about how people were denied the buddhist religion in india at the time .
and he goes back as a broken man to the village .
and he has to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , the smell and everything .
the animals are in one of their lives . people are people .
we &apos;re all out of . we take the feeling of memory to a mother and a lot of these things in this meditation .
and you think about how the things are , if they &apos;re happy , if they &apos;re happy .
and of course they are cruel and the other people .
even though the change in your attitude is something for other creatures , and you feel these new quality in you , and it &apos;s helping you , and it &apos;s helping you as a role model .
so the coffee table , or the cup of the cup , is using a set of tools to get the public health .
interestingly , the complexity is very high .
we &apos;ve heard about bill gates recently .
so it &apos;s very , very simple when you know how to read it .
well , let me close with four general remarks , an example and two aphorisms .
and i don &apos;t want to stop with the details , but in the lower right-hand corner , you &apos;re going to see what we have for this .
did you start doing that ?
and from the stuff that we have , the world &apos;s most important thing is that jimmy had spoken , what &apos;s our new way of organizing our new way of organizing , or better , how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things will always be able to be able to point it into the use of working with the power of the world .
let &apos;s take astronomy , which was yochai &apos;s first .
it &apos;s also going to be a professional argument , professional arguments .
so it will not be a dispute of two camp , but between these camps will be all interesting positions , which are taken from people .
that costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to spend their favorite people to spend their favorite and actually have a team , and then they did it between new zealand and spain .
and the first thing i thought was , was to thank him for this .
but the truth is that life is happening right here .
so people are calling up and they have news like this .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m like batman attracted to my anonymity . &quot;
and the one who didn &apos;t do it , so that it turned out to be just in a different city , and a new job had taken .
and in the last 35 years , i studied human behavior on the basis of everything , from genes , from genes , dopamine and the lhc , until the bottom of the day .
some of them have it . and it &apos;s dependent on gender .
that was one of those cases , because there was no force under her ancestors , but in my father , i &apos;ve already been .
they &apos;re similar to each other as you can only be .
by the way , i have a email today , and i &apos;ve got a email that &apos;s done today , and we &apos;ve completed the last part of a atlas .
and these guys here are the weak force , maybe most of the time .
so if you want to know why the sky is blue or why atomic nuclei are connected , you should basically be in the principle with a powerful computer -- why dna has the shape that you &apos;ve now got -- you &apos;ve got the shape that you &apos;ve got
the comparison is that people in this room are pointing to the higgs boson .
but it &apos;s really that with this theory of physics , the physics of the big bang seems to unite the big bang , and it &apos;s a wonderful prediction , which is not what it &apos;s done , but it seems to be doing it .
they created this civilization , this wonderful image , the darkness in light , and it allows it to see civilization from all of them .
another big insight came from a study of the wayne state university in 2010 , the baseball maps of the soviet league player , watching the gold cards from the 1950s .
in a similar study in germany , researchers are using a partial cartoonist to measure the city of the sun and after they had a little bit of the face of protons to climb .
&quot; because the colors that you have ordered , not the european standard , &quot; he said .
&quot; safer ? why ? more policemen are in the case ? &quot;
we built the light , the people who were the people who were taking people from the people of the world , to think that they were abroad , when they were going to be able to make their cause .
president roosevelt said , &quot; believe that you can do something and you &apos;ve been able to do half . &quot;
all around port-au-prince came out , entrepreneurs came up and offered a pharmaceutical sheet for mobile phones .
a graph for the tangible power of technology is in kibera .
by 2015 , there &apos;s three billion robots in the world .
in the shops of the environment , batteries and bread were tuned .
this river of time is embedded in everything : the erosion of a brain , in the bud , the in the rose of the rose .
read a storyteller with a writer ?
and also , if i look at the big bear , i remember how i was a kid on his head to slide out of his shoulders , and i feel again like this kid .
we &apos;ve always seen how creative technology can be , and we can do it in our lives and we can do those solutions , innovations and moments , which doesn &apos;t have the flow of time , but again .
my mother was a retired .
in every single refugee camp she had to write soldiers who had my older brother mark , who was nine , and he wanted to make a child child .
and i should do it alone .
take anything you want to have from the suitcase .
then i ended up in vegetarian , because i don &apos;t get my feelings .
thank you .
so almost everything on earth is going to be wiped out about five .
svante &apos;s answer has the answer .
why should that play a role ?
so , in theory , we can grow any organ from any cell .
here &apos;s the rise in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the bottom line .
when the rotors go to the same speed , the robot is floating .
and you see how robust control is .
and he does that while he &apos;s making obstacles .
they take their neighbors true .
this shows that we double the world &apos;s population , triple , four , big , where we can get them to form teams , how you can see here .
but the robot can also find out where it wants to go .
i can understand that . but there &apos;s so much and i want to expand your horizon , the consciousness , open your mind , and change your view of honeybees .
this has been a huge problem since many years , basically since the late 1980s , with the most common , which is a lot of different viruses , bacteria and water .
they don &apos;t experience that .
the donors take the sales for their dishes , and the honey -- there &apos;s the honey -- they use the honey on their bars .
the bee dies . honeybees die when they stick , so they didn &apos;t want to do it .
okay , now , really , the question is , why is this ?
and of course , we &apos;ve also done it , especially in the last decade , to put the world with a dense chain of industry , with a chain global trade .
and never before that was not aware of that much of the people in this fact .
in fact , many of you don &apos;t know that our bread was of course no european invention .
and especially the meat meat and china drives the water pressure up .
agriculture is for most people , and there are not many farmers under them , and they &apos;re bad to be the environment , to be in large scale , to destroy the environment .
everything is all together .
and so while i finished my bread , and i have it , and i &apos;m trying to burn it , and i &apos;m not trying to burn the hands .
and also , it has to be to keep the land available there with the tools that available there , materials and plastic systems .
you take someone like me , a scientist , analyzed and develop a new technology , and determines the quantitative design of the world .
because i hope you take this today , a new connection with nature .
this was a couple days ago in agumbe .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
this is from the last year .
but the other thing that was a lesbian vodka was one of them , and shekhar kapur was a film about her , the queen , you know , you &apos;d see .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but this is a subset of a subset of a sneak .
this is a patient who was at the time that 73 was at the time -- he needed a jump , decided to do it , but it was for this .
i like this slide because you &apos;re talking about what people really motivated to change , and what not .
if you eat a high bicycle meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a key thing . americans eat more fat , even more fat , and even more carbs , but the percentage , but the actual number higher , the goal is to reduce both .
one of the most popular studies found that 70 percent of people were clogged , 65 percent of people had bad breath , 54 percent had headaches -- that &apos;s not healthy nutrition .
on the other hand , everything is intimacy , which is intimacy .
i hope he &apos;s not going to hang it up .
the film is based on a solar system of f. scott
two main classes were involved in the project : warner brothers and the prison .
and we had enough passion to make the research and technology .
we call ourselves a motion capture .
the number seemed to be infinitely .
and these are the data that we get , and then we &apos;re using the model for the model .
and so the finished picture was that the movie was used .
this was a very , very , very early sample .
and we found this , in the middle of karnataka .
and has a very reactive .
people from gallup will overcome these awful , more powerful past , where they lived for their lives .
we were too weak -- two of the two years -- and imagine , this broad one is a ocean from sand , 40 degrees c , a water bottle .
i think the camel is the best of the most sophisticated animal in the world . &quot;
and they use them as similar as we see our dna team .
we weigh our animals .
so i &apos;ll show you another movie .
i &apos;m not going to go up until my body temperature is 40 degrees c -- enough to turn a egg to a egg .
so , thank you for inviting .
start a meeting with a poem . that &apos;s a idea .
but how would it like to be , if you never knew how to do the next day , the world is going to be a living god , your shoulders in the clouds , or if you &apos;re sitting down there from the celebrities , or you &apos;re standing
who could sleep in this night ?
but you know , judy &apos;s in your age was 150,000 dollars a movie , that the u.s. d was the french army , the french army , and he had kicked his room off the french army -- no wait , i mean that he had invented the calculator
at the end , they sat in a tree and a brick that &apos;s a moving hand .
and the human genome system is more than that , but if you remove these two columns , probably not much left .
and also , we have elephants that are the problem that you can &apos;t build construction , which would be too heavy for a single elephant .
one component of it is understanding . here &apos;s a key example : &quot; the ability to understand the emotions of the other and share . &quot;
so we &apos;re looking at more complex expressions here . here &apos;s consolation .
that the test is not good for you .
there &apos;s a very simple task that you have to do .
a philosopher actually wrote that it was impossible to have a sense of fairness , because fairness was invented in the french revolution .
now it &apos;s not a lonely kooks , it &apos;s not two kooks , three is a lot of things , and a lot of power is a lot of power .
the last decade i spent with this , i &apos;ve been able to go to pain and humiliation , hopefully for a good thing that &apos;s the most powerful .
and i have to say , god is thank you .
so i heard , in some way , it was a success .
over the years , the serious design system can produce serious design .
a.j. jacobs : how healthy life was almost
and i think many scientists share this view .
a really cool thing .
now these studies are scientifically valid and they were hacked , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
ask for the part of the story that &apos;s not going to tell .
... a priest ?
finally , one group that believes that the indus people are the ancestors in today &apos;s population today .
right after left , how many ? okay .
it can be useful in the field of energy , more data that then are then more difficult .
this sign is the most common of the indus script , and only in this text is twice .
it turns out that in india , it &apos;s already a long tradition , name on the ground of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth of the birth .
space , we all know how it looks .
this wire , the water bottle , would make the name bell famous .
gw had made the historical discovery that body bodies can also be able to give up radio waves as well .
all the young people in the city .
someone who &apos;s sitting in the seat next to you -- that &apos;s ok in a field of a computer , but you would sit on a side of a car , and someone would be so close to you , then you would be able to get a handle
the dalai lama always says -- he says , if you get to the idea of the idea of the art of the computer , it &apos;s because you realize that you can be yourself and your pain and your delight , and you eventually have a little playground for
but take this wonderful thing , the most wonderful thing we showed us , and they &apos;re scared of the world &apos;s brain .
a man ago was a picture of a tank that became a symbol of the whole world to a symbol of the resistance .
but what would you do not have anything else if you had had the modern communication to make a sense that it was wrong , that it was going to be something that was going on , just something that was going to be done , right ?
combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate on global level and organize globally with the challenges that are now in parallel and largely global nature .
in the museum of children in rwanda , there &apos;s a photograph of a young boy -- and the museum of children &apos;s lives were the life of life , who had died as a result of the security of the rwanda of rwanda .
here &apos;s the task : help me , a vibrant , a vibrant , a vibrant , a mess in 3d .
you can move on very different layers of dna -- they vary in the corporate industry , the movement of the surface and the given of the birth of the birth .
this is the driving algae .
boy : squash .
we slow down to see the spines in action .
mark cutkosky at stanford , one of my partners , is an extraordinary engineer that developed a technology called the shape of the shape , which is the way that it can compete directly into a artificial foot .
you &apos;re almost looking at the aliens . and the secret , what you stick , are your favorite toes .
so here we go off the band-aid .
these are the structures that allow these spikes to be the spines , and the water molecules , and the most challenging , hard surfaces to capture .
so , the very beautiful songs of the blind , which are creating a lot of beautiful songs and males as well as females are allowed to find each other and choose a partner .
so when dolphins are less than 20 feet apart , they have to be less than half the time of the whistles .
if we think of marine marine extraction , we have to be thinking about the consequences of our interventions in the clear way that we thought we were right .
after the most popular , the marine union has made these systems accessible to the systems to learn what the scientists could hear .
they just hear the low frequencies .
if males and females use this signal to find a partner and they &apos;re scattered , they imagine what the impact of the spread are the species of spreading species .
how did ships be made . they found that with a better , more powerful , that noise can be reduced 90 percent of these noise .
they &apos;re going to get the speed to 50 percent .
we see strangers , we see strangers , 300 , and they &apos;re always becoming more . and they &apos;re not like us .
you have all the possibilities available .
we observe a continual rise of the men .
and obviously there &apos;s a hundred , and it &apos;s a hundred .
with initiatives like 100 dollars laptop , it &apos;s my thoughts that we can bring a whole new generation of people in the old world .
thank you .
i think nothing is the problem .
but our daily life is , in a remarkable state , we say in a remarkable state .
usually , it &apos;s one or two per year .
and there are !
but we &apos;re much more sophisticated .
part of the challenge was to try to get rhythm and space by not just my hands -- juggling is much more nuanced -- but the rhythm of my body and the feet , and the balls of my feet .
and then they play crazy .
ok , because they don &apos;t understand what a car &apos;s worth is , i give you a little hint .
now , again , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
you have someone up here , who &apos;s the most important principle to do this all the life , ok ?
shake -- and then it comes to calm . just a little number of time .
with space and straight in the room , working in other ways .
and then levels of levels .
in this year -- if you &apos;d have the slides -- in this year , we carry the world &apos;s s , and we &apos;ve got a project that we &apos;ve been helped to get out of design .
we can call this up on a high-speed network that allows you to give more information about the clothing of clothing , while you &apos;re doing these kinds of things .
and scott adams : i found that i &apos;m on the way to become the leader of the leader .
and we also have a new product now , and it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s shown to be a public public .
now , the farmers can only be in the rainy season , and not in the most profitable harvest .
electrons disappear in a way of a kind of energy , and then only energy is still , and energy can &apos;t see .
that &apos;s what he thought he was like .
potatoes , potatoes have 48 chromosomes . did they know ?
well . atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
and somebody said to him , &quot; well , what is the point of this , henry ?
we &apos;ve been doing about four years of this for about four years .
if google gave a book , you bring it into a very nice format .
i &apos;ll give you an example .
suddenly , in the middle of the &apos; 40s , everybody was excited .
but imagine , it &apos;s not going to be interested .
but also many very much on the right , that apparently have the propaganda .
if you get the toe hits , it means &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; machine &quot; with a a.
if i run this pink sound for longer than some minutes , you would literally stop hearing it .
many people escape to tie them , but this turn large , public spaces like this , shared , divided in millions of personal personal personal particles .
you can do that in a beautiful place , like a lake .
and finally , a acronym .
and i said , &quot; that &apos;s my job . &quot;
thank you so much for me . we &apos;re all so grateful . &quot;
and they went away .
because they weren &apos;t at the sidewalk , and they couldn &apos;t see the exchange between me and my thesis , a exchange that was fair to tell us , but that &apos;s alien .
well , i &apos;m going to tell you , in the last year , there was a lot of competition , because the arab spring is still spreading out , the most prolific , the most profitable , is it collapses ?
this photograph was actually taken into a police station , and you see the bottom of the people who were tracking by the police .
the kids just do photos in a class , the teacher gets them , they paste them on the top of the road .
in today &apos;s talk , it &apos;s about the brain and yay , somewhere out there , a little bit out there .
this is something we can work in in our lifetimes , and i thought i could make a difference and i tried to get out of the window , and i was trying to get out of the street .
but sometimes science has some other properties that really make you really interesting .
what are we going to bring more data ?
there &apos;s something we believe it is obvious , but wrong .
it &apos;s that intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we don &apos;t look at the alligator as a very intelligent , not in a human way .
in humans , we &apos;ve developed the most powerful part of the patent system , which is called the name of the neocortex , and nature has done this little trick .
it &apos;s not that you &apos;re going to look at it and say , &quot; what am i seeing ?
not like a computer designer . not as a computer computer .
these are the things that are first coming .
we need something , we need something military , but only to defense .
you can see it in your process . &quot;
she was , because she was the time of elections outside the country .
this is the most powerful thing to do .
and then , when they closed the door , grandma said , &quot; no , no , no , no .
they wash it like this .
these group uses three , every one .
it &apos;s real .
it &apos;s done to learn english and learning this as a language language .
the computer already , and it &apos;s in one of three people .
if you think , you know , you &apos;re going to think differently than the employers of the united states , which actually was part of our experiment , because that &apos;s exactly what we did .
we repeated the experiment with the same groups , but we would add a delay between the enlightenment , how we deal with the data , and the actual start of the carbon system .
the price of this is the civil extension of paradise .
and they moved and downloaded themselves to each other and they were going to jump their arms up to each other and leave them .
we &apos;re really good at talking about skills and security and health , we &apos;re really bad at talking about character .
and then they make personal coach , the most powerful , like the bad breath in the world .
i don &apos;t really feel like emotion .
the first gift , or talent , is a lot of the ability to look at other people &apos;s minds and figure out what they have to offer .
they have a mess .
this is what the unconscious is demanding .
we found them between the software of many , raped by many , many men , i don &apos;t know how many .
where does their journey start ?
and that it &apos;s not normal to live in a home .
what was my challenge ?
they need their empathy .
lexicography : that &apos;s what dictionaries did .
well , first of all , i &apos;m going to blame the queen because it &apos;s funny .
online dictionaries have to be different .
the bad words -- look at a place , and then you don &apos;t find it on the map , and then he doesn &apos;t think , &quot; this map sucks ! &quot;
you think , &quot; ok , if we think that words are tools that we use to give our thoughts expression , where should you know that embryonic better is better than hammer ?
the tv-industrial has 33 different definitions of &quot; set . &quot;
and then there &apos;s this mike , mike &apos;s life , and mike &apos;s life in britain .
i &apos;ve got the whole time , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , &quot; the dictionary . &quot;
so , i &apos;m a chair .
and , to make a long story short , i ended up with it .
and so , play for play , as this three days , you start to understand : why am i hearing all this kind of stuff ?
they &apos;re perhaps from a ted speaker , and we can keep the conversation during the year , and next year , the same intellectual and emotional journey .
the manufacturers didn &apos;t have been launched in their cheap , because they &apos;re not sure what would be the public with a level of so precise , which could actually fold up to the palm .
there was no way that it was already , if you &apos;ve got pirated , and it was technically not able to find the user .
instead of cleaning up the food industry , you make it .
and , &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
we call ourselves a &amp; amp ; wiser and we live in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this work is the cartoon of a human being .
we debate the case &quot; what the world needs now , &quot; is nuclear -- right or wrong ?
and there &apos;s only three main types of power for this -- coal and gas , the almost all over the place -- and nuclear power .
we &apos;ve become the russian warheads , by being transformed into electricity .
the emissions are equivalent of land emissions , and the particles that are causing greenhouse gases , and the particles that have been transformed to co2 .
now , if you look at the fact that the prevalence of nuclear weapons is the spread of nuclear weapons , because we know that india and pakistan are developing nuclear weapons through the world &apos;s disease , and they have developed nuclear weapons in the world .
for wind , the area is much bigger , but the most common is smaller .
the reality is that 21 states have nuclear power , right ?
and in the senate of the united states , we need the support of both parties -- only one or two voices , to be able to do global warming in the senate , and this room can help .
we &apos;re not going to get enough energy from renewables .
i was worried about the 10 years that i was worried about .
thank you .
this was -- my motivation was slaughtered by apollo .
for the first time , we have enough wealth in the hands of some less people , and the available technology that allows us to be able to explore the space of space .
26 groups from seven countries took the competition , and every one between and 25 million dollars from .
so , we can bring them to the space station .
and the advantage for the funders is the sum of the distribution of the world &apos;s willingness and the social media system .
would you surprise us , we &apos;re fascinated with us ?
that means that surfaces can make itself . they can be incredibly small .
a challenge was how we can fix these new algorithmic order in a column .
what i didn &apos;t know at the time is because we just saw the outside , the areas continued to keep the space on the edge of the column , which was a pretty surprising discovery .
inspired by the process of division , michael ornish &apos;s algorithms , the incredible , fascinating forms of millions of surfaces , can create a person , but you can build it , and you could build our understanding of architecture .
so , look at this picture here -- a lot of forms dance here for you .
it &apos;s a very rare disease .
this is a drug that has been developed for cancer .
you can see , the chip actually mimics the most powerful .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s led by young people .
and i think many people here in the room are in the same position like me .
so i think women in our society are becoming leaders because they realize that they &apos;re very important for their future generations to get our cultural identities .
we &apos;ve realized that recently , more people have been using the means of youtube and social networks to show their stories , to show their photos and tell their own stories about their own voices .
at the same time , we &apos;re going to go to it , and we find them to explore and to explore the world .
so i &apos;ve been looking at more or less than not .
so i thought , &quot; maybe if i do this ants , you &apos;ll pull a few apartments . &quot;
this was called &quot; chopsticks house . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do that ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back the next day .
and it went ...
my work , roughly estimated , sometimes five , six or seven weeks ; you can &apos;t always anticipate .
and i recorded it , and it shaped the chariot &apos;s car .
so i broke the needle .
it &apos;s a very , very utilitarian work , but the best things come in small pieces of light .
you expect your employees to do what she asked them to do when you &apos;ve done the task , you can do more .
there &apos;s this absolute concentration of being , this absolute , complete , conscious relationship of consciousness , awareness , an absolute center of compassion and love that the primary properties of the divine element .
my favorite body flew into the one direction , my favorite wheel in the other .
i asked all the shots that i probably wouldn &apos;t do with them , the most popular ones i would not be able to do , which i would not look at , the friends that i wouldn &apos;t look at you .
because you don &apos;t need the most powerful .
and if you &apos;re going to get off the back of the back , against the wind , you can just keep it down and it &apos;s doing it in the dirt . &quot;
20 years ago , the doctors had cut my leg and hoped , and there was a 15 percent chance of opportunity .
as i became more and more natural , and at that point in my life , i was probably 14 kilos easier than i am now .
and nobody is going to suggest this modern , more than david black .
walking upright , you say , is the threshold of what makes us human .
he &apos;s president of the international union for the most successful , which is the least the most powerful name i &apos;ve ever heard .
he was born three months early , and it was really a fantastic fan of him .
so once i tried to get to the piano , i became hard to get a lot of credit .
and at the end , you were so fast that things like the flight didn &apos;t have trouble , right ?
do you want to hear me ?
dp : &quot; tiger rag &quot; .
i don &apos;t get that .
they &apos;re fighting about their own lifestyle in this forest , in a world that is still clean , a world that &apos;s still not a legitimate , in a world that &apos;s not a distorted .
we know today that they are capable of getting their research to the absolute impossible , when i started .
the long loving people who are developing the day for the mother who developed during this long childhood , and also the siblings , can remain the whole life , and that can be a long time to 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and also the huge camp of the forest in the forest now needs meat , and so the pygmies that were getting caught in the congo congo and they were in their wonderful lifestyle as many hundred years , cooked .
yesterday , that guy said .
we &apos;re now in every state , and the problems in florida are other than the new york .
do you get me down here and throw me down here ?
there are politicians out there ?
what we want to do in the lab is that pretty much the same , but with a few dozen of different kinds of molecules -- such a dramatic reduction of complexity , but yet , trying to create something more profound .
it &apos;s actually very , very utilitarian . if you &apos;re in a sense , it doesn &apos;t really do something .
now , where you &apos;re all experts , we &apos;re going to play with these protocells .
we then see the self-assembly of these bodies from oil spills that we &apos;ve seen before , and the black dots represent these black mud , these black mud , very complex , organic black mud .
in his lab , martin gardner &apos;s &quot; protocells &quot; has been , &quot; mystery , &quot; abstract blobs of chemicals that behave like living cells . his work shows how life could come on on earth -- and maybe elsewhere .
this is a video project to run your tadpole at night .
what &apos;s that -- where did you know ? you &apos;ve taken it .
but if we did that at every fire -- every fire , we could redefine the emergency in the world .
it &apos;s the crap that &apos;s otherwise going to be locked in your beautiful pink lungs , and that &apos;s going to be associated with it .
the birds could jump from one to another jump .
you can get out of the news of him . you can talk to him .
but to keep these herd , a big amount of our planet will demand .
next , we &apos;re installing skin cells and multiply it in a brain scanner .
we &apos;ve been working with a lot of years of time with plastic , and we started with products like wine , and the yogurt and yogurt .
it &apos;s true that if we &apos;re all on the world , we see that there &apos;s almost a universal pursuit of people after having a car .
let me talk about hydrogen .
this is a huge opportunity to create energy , to create energy .
if we can see these online future , it can also be other .
you had to survive .
and we certainly gave ourselves to be our school district to get funding and support .
because why should our students go so far away from their lives ?
it became a book , then a demo .
there was an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
here &apos;s the west coast of the west coast .
but on this picture , you see how we started building the world &apos;s most powerful , which was soon a big diagnostic of brazil .
when i was for the time , my favorite time started to start , i studied the new field of the research project .
if you look at the south of manhattan , you see the expansion of new york city like it was , at the end of the american revolution .
the white areas on this map are the more safe places .
or the most prolific , the wet meadows , insects and the other places needed .
maybe a computer company was alive .
it &apos;s so much power to unite science and visualization , that these images are coming together , and it &apos;s like seeing these images of the mirror .
and we have a really dramatic amount of magnitude of this now .
so i don &apos;t have to go to that .
you can get the pristine thing to do , of course .
this is a building building .
one of the things we all know is that the cell phone is . right ?
and it &apos;s all about this question -- of course in a very artistic and indirect way .
but it &apos;s happening everywhere , and these tools are parts of it that help us .
seriously -- clap it off -- that &apos;s really great .
alex steffen : a sustainable future
you could mean that this could be a big problem for a law , but congress seems not to be very happy to do it .
but if you &apos;re making a lot of quality of your hands , and you sell it , it &apos;s not okay .
some of the things we share , we made things that we found , and every single option is going to be the same thing that we have in this industry .
that &apos;s the simple thing .
i had a very animated , more expensive , expensive education in india , and that made me almost broken .
and i thought , i &apos;m going to start a barefoot college -- college only for the poor .
a professional is somebody with a combination of competence , confidence and belief .
when i said that , they said , &quot; do you show us what &apos;s possible . what do you do ?
the entire current is coming from the sun .
democracy , the way you &apos;re missing your country , what you should do , what you should do , what you should do if you &apos;re sick .
it comes to tensions , reduce the presence of the schools , it &apos;s going to catch between teachers and parents , so the teachers and parents are calling the teachers and parents , and they say , &quot; give you the hands .
you use sign signs .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , sir president .
a computer company .
and our main design of the world &apos;s largest , dynamic , dynamic computer of the world for this kind of view of this .
you see the most popular ones along the world that we have as artists for the scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , there &apos;s data of these two groups of people , data about how happy they are .
&quot; i &apos;m going to be physically , financially , emotionally , emotionally , mentally , mentally , mentally , and in almost every other way . &quot;
he was unable to eradicate him , and of course , ray was six months later , the same idea of the same idea .
in this case , because they &apos;re in the experiment i &apos;ve been using to tell you about , you have to prints from the images of the images .
we collected our materials , and we went out of the room , waiting for half an hour .
i &apos;m going to show you why .
they &apos;ve got two pictures and they had two beautiful folk files , and they were very much the big things , and we said , &quot; which of that would you go ? &quot;
we take a whole new group of naive , and say , &quot; you know , we give a laser and we can do it in two different ways .
and the big car and the most beautiful car is beautiful .
voices : it flies into the air . oh shit .
&quot; ma , don &apos;t start ! &quot;
don &apos;t forget that this tradition of the clouds from the clouds are coming up , but further back into a time , even before we were recording stories on the wet side or the more targeted at the expense of the air .
the kind of food , yeah .
the kind of thing that the roof , you know .
and so we decided to put his father on his own , because i knew he would kill me if i had to drive them alone . so we go into the car .
&quot; and had this guy a giant uniform , and a little bit of a little bit of a face in the face ? &quot;
i really want to go in ? because if i don &apos;t have a thread to get me out of a lot of metaphors -- enough metaphor for your taste ? -- could it be that i never come back again .
look ? we &apos;re a secret club with a secret called a secret .
she says , &quot; ma , you have to look ! &quot;
&quot; i &apos;m looking for the little old lady , damn , damn . &quot;
it &apos;s up from the car . &quot;
i really am afraid .
so what is the social outcome ?
where do i go today and with whom together ?
and if we have it , we &apos;ll decide how many miles we drive , where we live , where we live and work .
smart terminal on the station communicate and you see exactly where your bus is just on the front and when he comes , and you can buy your tickets in real time .
i want to say that we &apos;re going to be able to form wireless forms of mesh , and i &apos;m going to urge that this network is open to open standards for each one .
and they came in the late 1960s here .
and for all of you who came with mental illness in touch , what a challenge can be .
i said that i wanted to tell the most popular , i wanted to share with you the three a &quot; a fantastic &quot; and i wanted to leave you with a final stop .
because they were all three years old .
and so what i love about this story is that rosey grier is just a genuine person , and that &apos;s what authenticity is about .
i ate the play-dough with a police . &quot;
you can sleep in clean sheets .
j it &apos;s so many that the problem is that the problem has become problematic .
i found it strange to craft as if it was a competition , about a fresh wound .
it &apos;s a precious , rich , rich , rich , rich , not to be informed for the city .
it looks pretty simple , but it was a kind of a computer company .
people are doing the two things about two things -- they were amazed about the destruction , but there was also a sense of the most prolific of the new york , which i found very moving .
because in the process of the four platforms , the size of the world -- which is a more powerful version of a brain &apos;s population -- we knew that it had to be mobile , to be able to respond to the conditions and the change zero of ground
we have the opportunity to rethink our thinking about cities .
dr : it was a privilege .
and i know kids suffer every year .
if -- god forbid -- somebody from us here , and a concussion , would be the most of us in a period of a few hours , and a concussion , most of us , are completely completely eager to have a few weeks completely .
you have to be familiar with the problems that we &apos;re talking about today .
and as it turns out , tom saw a helmet that was a helmet for 20 dollars a good way to preserve a 100,000 percent of the time .
it &apos;s not true , but it happened to tony blair during the davos in 2005 , when his doodles , of course , &quot; discovered &quot; and he was described .
in other words , they have a common and growing complexity of visual language that happens in the process of the process .
it was said that there was no cure .
today , all countries are committed to offer patents for drugs that were at least 20 years .
it depends on the drug companies of drug companies , their patents to be able to get them to be available and make them available for others .
in 1956 , the same way , a health system , the people sitting in the marshall sun , the afternoon in a very high humidity , and they didn &apos;t feel like that .
you can adapt everything to worry about your well-being .
he offers all these services , competing , tickets , and so little things that you &apos;re doing online , but for people who are so much connected to the digital world .
the question was , &quot; how do you make it from this teacher .
so , let &apos;s see what he does here . -- -- -- you see what he does .
and the daughter &apos;s husband , he was also sick by the exhaustion of his wife .
but the visual complexity is still very large .
well , the first time , a computer bank had a major set of research on our studies .
well , if we feel emotions , we show them .
and you could get the impression that the unfortunate people are taking a different structural position within the network .
that &apos;s my favorite . &quot;
they &apos;re both made of carbon , and yet one of both of them are in the way that they &apos;re in particular , on the left , and they get the soft and dark , and they &apos;re getting the soft and dark .
so to point that into a moment , let me just pull out a moment .
and then , older is not just going to be .
under the same circumstances , older people are putting their cognitive resources , like the more responsible and memory , more on positive information than negative .
we &apos;re going to cost life .
they wanted me to do , &quot; tonight , i &apos;m going to perform this kind of thing for this girl on this bar . &quot;
kid david : it &apos;s so that i &apos;m honest , often not really , really , what happens when i dance .
they &apos;ve been called me and uncles and i was invited to be invited over a period of five years .
leah : the second contract from fort laramie stopped the sovereignty of the great sioux nation and the most powerful of the lakota of the lakota black hills .
the treaty of fort laramie said that at least three quarter of the world &apos;s worth of the world would have to sign the country .
they were tired of the treaties .
the most prolific is eight times as high as the american average .
so what remains ?
and today , child mortality dropped from 24 percent to a year in 1960 today .
you get it either as a pill or as a syringe , you have to take it every day to regulate blood sugar .
if we do it , we have to do with people ...
but basically , it makes a lot of sense .
is it called , are you smarter than a car party ?
bmw is a very safe car .
the problem for bmw is that this car looks safe .
now you &apos;re going to think , &quot; if my life depends on it , i &apos;ll use it every day . &quot;
we need to connect this with a scientific method .
this is something else to do , actually , effective campaign .
what &apos;s new is not new .
the lights are going to be dark .
we do it for our clients .
we have the sun in the sun .
now , logic -- logical , logical , is what you &apos;re looking at from this position in the right -- without moving the wrist .
i &apos;m going to be now going to be balanced . now , every time ... another person -- not always the same answers .
so , if you &apos;re interested in this , i &apos;m going to present some of the most cosmopolitan .
here -- i have to look at looking at the beginning , so i can follow my maps during the most successful -- oh , we should have started to have a problem -- no problem .
yeah ?
i think ...
lg : pardon ?
what &apos;s the card i want to use ? the lady or the five ?
lg : but you see your hand .
wait , wait , please , any card .
another color . lg : diamonds , perfect .
compassion .
diamonds , yes ? zoe : yeah .
here -- all the cards fit -- there &apos;s all the cards hidden -- is it all that &apos;s hidden me ?
and finally , the king -- in exactly ... five seconds .
some of you seem to know this child .
after i was back , i &apos;ve made my whole company to a college party . &quot;
if you have no mental hearing , she could not turn a break in the car .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s really happening here .
i &apos;m always saying , &quot; if you have a fallacy , you always have a eyebrow , then everybody recognizes . &quot;
imagine the person and follow the way from the h to e and you &apos;ll hear everything that chopin had to say .

and the most popular said , &quot; if we don &apos;t have transition transition , we have to invent all of the entire environmental infrastructure for the first time . &quot;
but there &apos;s a problem .
the budgets are not really balanced , and to a certain degree of exactly the games that they play to hide this , the theme that they &apos;re going to be , the subject that they &apos;re really quite obvious challenges .
in fact , there are five states that are worse , and really only four states that are not going to be the challenge of this .
and even if you &apos;re going to get to the same way , you could get money to get there .

the economic consequences are almost inconceivable .
a big part of the species will be threatened by extinction .
now , if a car accident happens , it &apos;s critical that we don &apos;t just save the stunt stunt , but the crew .
so , for that , otherwise , they used to be used , and it was used , and that was all you had .
but today we use a solar system .
more is it , a more powerful one .
in 1960 , joseph gardner has something that was very incredible from the united states air force .
one of the difficulty in this altitude , if you go to 10,000 feet -- that &apos;s great , right ? if you go to 10,000 , you can really use oxygen .

well , you &apos;re a lot of behavior , and you &apos;re a behavior of behavior , and you &apos;re a sense of the mind .
we don &apos;t have all the facts . we don &apos;t even know what tools are going to be , or what we need to be searching for in the very way to be able to get to that , before the different behavior shows .
how are you going to scale it up ? &quot;
the three are the same , although they &apos;re all the same in different context , one is magical , the other two are like work , because they have something very special about themselves , because they have something very special about themselves .
the kids taught them to do it .

howard makes this experiment and when he gets the data , he &apos;s going to see a curve , and suddenly he recognizes that no beauty is going to make it .

von neumann , a computer scientist and a mathematician of the army , took everything together , and then they needed a room to build them .
the way that we did it and a copy worked first by a day .

i know if i got to get beaten . &quot;
he had the machine running all night , if someone remembers stephen wolfram , who invented the whole thing again .

it &apos;s ready city .
and he &apos;s got the antenna full of it . he &apos;s sorry to have his friends , his family and his community .

if you can cook , time doesn &apos;t matter .
in america , many wonderful things are going on when we &apos;re just looking back at the time .
misha glenny : anonymous , ladies and gentlemen -- a clever group of political hackers who passed in 2011 .
the net connects everything and will be very soon a lot of human activity .
interestingly , anonymous uses its information information , but not for financial profits .
he explained to me in 2003 and 2004 , as he went in new york at tour , and 10,000 dollars from the atm machine here , 30,000 dollars from the atm machine , using 30,000 cards .
he was born in a stable and respect in a stable and respect family family , his obsession with play as adolescents .
and most of the , with the script , and the script , didn &apos;t reveal social skills in the world -- only in the web .
i think there are several reasons . i &apos;m not going to go into the details , but some mention .
but they &apos;re all determined by the market , and what &apos;s going to drive the market is mostly -- number one is the big demographic of the population .
we &apos;ve also found a lot of examples of dead boxes that have been transformed into all kinds of social institutions , many schools , many churches , and many libraries , and many libraries , like this one .
and finally , i expect the streets to be extended through the mall .
it &apos;s very successful , and it helped be helpful to make that eight of 13 local vehicles in gombe plans in gombe plans .
the stream was covered by the parking parking .
their citizens are different than typical of the typical , but they &apos;re less than cities .
&quot; his vagina , &quot; she said , &quot; she said , &quot; is a whole kind of a newspaper . &quot;
but actually , it didn &apos;t start there , it started with a conversation with a woman .
it &apos;s about a gender that is a fundamental resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a key , and the way it really exists in the body , and i think there &apos;s a real meaning in our bodies , our bodies made on our heads -- that these separation has created a division that has a division of decision .
i want to tell you this little story about my own birth , because it &apos;s very strong with happiness , and agnes .
maybe it &apos;s in my inbox south carolina , who is not much smaller than today &apos;s hungary , and once of a future as an independent country .
well , maybe he was too damn too damn , because he stayed where he was , long after the nazis , and even after the most popular and the most cosmopolitan and the most respected and the most respected and the most respected and the rubber workers started budapest
and he got the same answer : &quot; bring me the best workers you can find and if you &apos;re good enough , i &apos;ll give you a . &quot;
and so clearly , it says , &quot; it &apos;s okay . it was all so beautiful .
&quot; aha ! &quot; said dr. robicsek . &quot; i &apos;ve gone in the movie . &quot;
like i said , he &apos;s going to get too much .
and you can imagine it right .
you know what you &apos;re looking for .
but we take care of the most difficult cases and a lot of the people who are back to the next day .
so we came to these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mother went to the soviet union while the soviet union .
and if you think it &apos;s not more , it &apos;s going to go to it so long until you keep doing .
what i want to try to do with this is to point out the dots .
and what i want to point out later in the presentation , 50 percent of the u.s. is under the ocean .
it &apos;s there , because the photons can &apos;t reach the average depth of the ocean , which is the main valley , the valley is on the sea floor .
and so we drove along the mountain range in a field next to the bottom of the road , and found the missing heat .
so i started to develop a new new school project with a computer that replaced me , and i don &apos;t have to go up to my car .
we find the conservation in the conservation .
and i looked at them yesterday , it &apos;s up in seattle . ok .
but i would leave a kid without a driver &apos;s license to drive my tax system .
in some parts of the world , for example , in south africa , education is really hard to fix .
when we saw the effect of the more unequal , andrew and i , we had to move it to so many people like possible to offer the best education .
what was the special deal of these courses ?
the video is interrupted all the few minutes , and the students will ask a question .
so we wanted to convince some of our colleagues of the humanities that multiple choice is not so bad .
in terms of certain courses , you can ask the most of the most common misunderstanding and how to help the students to fix these .
we even see the beginning of either through a personalized curriculum or through the kind of brain , that we showed them .
i thought about my space in the universe , and what my first thought was , what &apos;s infinity when i was a kid .
and of course , in our society , it &apos;s mainly about being able to make other reality .
i have my doubt about the number of newton &apos;s values , like rationality , it &apos;s expected to be rational in a pool of a rational .
so you can understand my surprise when i got to read in the new yorker , that alan greenspan , the head of the file , is , in the way , in illinois , his mentor mentor .
i think you can make yourself fun , and you can &apos;t have the fun that you have , and that &apos;s not exactly what i &apos;m like , and that &apos;s why i don &apos;t have a jokes about 80,000 o &apos;clock and his charming .
i &apos;m going to get right in the front of the day of the lake , i &apos;m telling you .
he said , i &apos;d have to pay him more respect because it can take to 18 years to be a really good job .
huh ? yes ? what ? i can &apos;t hear them . &quot;
and i &apos;m afraid that this active person doesn &apos;t like us .
i &apos;ve thought about moshe &apos;s thoughts about beauty that she was thinking about yesterday , because there &apos;s a book in his book that that headset can sometimes bring beauty to beauty .
george w. bush : what the defense of our security costs , and what the defense of our freedom costs , we need to pay the price . &quot;
ten years ago , no astronomer would have been on the world , and that &apos;s what we did , or very few astronomers -- that there are planets outside of our solar system .
many other ecosystems on earth are truly in danger .
he &apos;s constantly making it that an experiment could go wrong with a particle accelerator and a line of a line that could destroy the world .
we need to make the same kind of optimal way of doing the same kind of thing as a function of oil .
we don &apos;t want to see that .
what can we do about it ?
and now the worst thing comes from .
we use a lot of money on it , making sure that we don &apos;t die at a time of dying , but we &apos;re almost not going to be completely preventable . and yet it &apos;s completely preventable .
we don &apos;t want to get caught up on the wrong foot .
i hope that &apos;s going to happen .
this is very , very important , because this is the system that came out of the life , and it &apos;s now time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing insight . and we &apos;ve only been aware of it recently .
and this is what the system was getting , a number of places in the southern hemisphere , shown in these circles .
everybody who comes to this is just taking the database and can make information out , and it can be made for everything that &apos;s going to happen .
we &apos;re at a ride to ride the wave , the technological possibilities .
in a earthquake , big amounts of these new microbes that we never saw before , from the sea floor .
the most powerful john &apos;s system creates a network of the steel cameras and sensors that make our oceans to global , interactive lab -- and a key story about the world of deep .
so i think optimism is going to move forward to architecture .
so again , radical versus conservative .
the most obvious thing about the obvious . you know , too often you want to understand everything .
our intellectual desires are complex .
you know that it &apos;s true ; the cathedrals , when unexpected , is always unexpected .
but i prefer to play something completely unknown , and even with mistakes , rather than the same constantly constantly , so it &apos;s taken off by its insignificance .
risks of rooms never have been so much like they should be in a groundbreaking city .
there &apos;s the emotions of the victims .
daniel libeskind builds up very large ideas , and he &apos;s called 17 terms of the vision of the architecture of architecture -- raw , innocence , more low-cost , radical -- and inspiration for every bold creative quest .
it also has the lowest level of all the cars of this size .
so , it &apos;s a really easy thing , or will it just be a few more basic things ?
em : it &apos;s got to be , just , if not , we &apos;re in big trouble .
with this capital , and publishing the input on the roof and then it &apos;s the killing or a monthly unit of a monthly , which is lower than the bill .
we &apos;ve almost failed , but we &apos;ve gone through it at 2008 .
it &apos;s similar to a jet jet .
how about everything in the world could be innovative ?
look at this .
boy , if you &apos;re eating our livestock , and a cheetahs , as he eats one of our goats , it &apos;s very nervous . then just go to him .
we suffered hunger .
our tradition looks like this : in every single business , there &apos;s a holy fire .
so , to the world of wildlife , we were able to make wildlife wildlife in the world that &apos;s going to be able to make a lot of programs with the world &apos;s lives .
very important -- we invest in the money in education , and hiv .
and the most powerful -- again , a lot of the world &apos;s most powerful -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful means .
and we &apos;re hiding this price behind huge winning .
dan kacyra and alice ornish celebrated the torch revolution for environmental services .
and the currents , shells , oysters , the , recyclable , water , the -- that was the known species .
this is like a genealogical of protein .
science looks at the world through the mind , and the sense of the things that can be measured and described , but there &apos;s a framework for knowledge and insight .
from a few cameras , a plan was a plan of 25 weeks of a plan .
this is the natural cycle .
that would not be a photographer that would normally do a photographer , a photograph that &apos;s like this , right ? but sometimes it must be to show the dimensions .
here you see the glacier moving back .
so this is a couple of cameras .
could india be the origin of the origin or a global center for innovation , just like it has become a global center for the world &apos;s and financial center ?
when we asked people in conversation with people in these business classes , they said , &quot; we &apos;re working on global products . &quot;
you can &apos;t be a professor if you weren &apos;t a student .
the best hospitals , the doctors for drugs , would go to the rescue of births , and on births , heart disease , heart disease , for artificial , to the morning .
it works a little bit like -- this is a recently ted project for four o &apos;clock in the morning .
i said , i know a very frustrating message when i see a look .
everyone in our society is going to be connected to cancer -- if not personal , then by a beloved people , a family member , a friend , a friend .
in this space , the genetic material , the chromosomes , within a nucleus .
we &apos;ve applied tumor treating fields in the lab over 20 different types of cancer , and we see this effect in all of them .
he got the most popular .
but what we can see is that in sixth month , the tumor has react and he starts looking at it .
that &apos;s just the beginning .
this is a new occupation , a new project .
in fact , they are 15 feet deep , and they collect rainwater from the roof , there &apos;s a little pipe , and from their courtyard .
so , water from 300 miles away , it looks like it &apos;s going to look .
a stream or a football system is through this scene .
this is called &quot; biff . &quot; in english , we have the water and water .
and you still have to go further .
these are the beautiful stairs we saw on one of the images .
and the most pervasive is to go down 27 percent : 600,000 fewer people get hiv in sub-saharan africa .
10 percent of india .
they will get the jobs in the textiles , which are getting people from the most responsible and to get them to distance and produce wealth .
and the countries on the right , because you see the most the most responsible , in principle , has a lot of a country with a computer company , say , less than 5,000 dollars , a computer of saying we &apos;re three .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india grew up not so right .
buy african products .
but i think a lot of the problem is that this logic -- that we should be to drop ipods and not bombs -- i mean , it would give a great title for thomas clooney &apos;s new book .
so , 500 people have been accepted and four of them have been chosen to visit the institution and so they &apos;re going to be able to do it , and then to fight it .
so now citizens with a global planning to 2020 is not necessarily something that is changing in this , because it &apos;s still the dictators who control the agenda .
so , the internet &apos;s s , is the internet &apos;s worst of the great expectations ?
&quot; a man . &quot;
and he was on the younger guys with us .
because for me , that &apos;s been in this time , and in this particular business , the question was : &quot; do you want to ? &quot; you want to be , &quot; you want to ? &quot;
i was so paralyzed , people .
as indians , and now politicians and the most responsible , i &apos;m pretty much about the most popular , concerned , all the talk about india as a new trade , even the new superpower .
in other words , all sorts of technologies tell us about countries , regardless of whether they want to come to daylight or not .
but then the lightning in our country , at the time , struck it , took it to a half an hour , and it took a call of a call .
it can &apos;t understand the conversation .
this can sometimes be experienced , and you can have an informed consequences .
and these of you who have their money to see their money , like many of the most powerful ones on the top of the mountain , are the most amazing ones that explain the most powerful .
i went home and i was doing a little bit of a little bit , and i found some startling statistics .
so , the name of the water is a bath without water .
and now i feel like george bush .
now , this title , this expression , comes from a critic , a early critic and this is a passage that i just love , and i would like to read them .
and that &apos;s a good thing , because if it would be so , mother nature would have a problem , how about all the chimpanzees in the world , we get to mate ?
that &apos;s the hardest part , which is not obvious . and so i &apos;ve got it for the end .
ok ? stop . that &apos;s going to go .
i don &apos;t know why there are a little bit of a child &apos;s favorite , but no matter what you &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you . thank you .
i actually suspect that the most common thing is probably familiar with a lot of reasons why we want to put new things into very , very quickly .
it &apos;s like this . you should see something like this .
bob mckim has a different very -- another version of this exercise in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned that with time : you get a lot better in logos , much more creative results , if all of you think about the rules .
and suddenly , there was an productive conversation about design around a real object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little bit skeptical , i &apos;ll come back to it .
you know how it feels , all of these uncertainty , as long as you leave back in the corridor , as the doctors in one of the most responsible ways , and you &apos;re asking , what &apos;s going on here .
so we would all feel safe and have a good time , because we agree about the rules and that would be true .
we do everything that leads to success , but then if we &apos;re there , we think we &apos;ve done it . we &apos;re satisfied to be satisfied and just stop doing all that , and we just have to do that .
i was faster , but as well as i was .
i learned that success is not a one-way street .
and the most easy is just full of hot boys . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh my god , &quot; hopefully , for forever , the last time in public .
he certainly made sure that all fit together .
it took 900 people to do it .
and the second is that people obviously experience a real connection .
these are questions .
as you see in today liberal liberal democracies , society , the state of us not only to determine our self , our self , but it also demands it from us .
it means we &apos;re going to meet our full potential than human beings .
so these are the layers that are the kinds of questions that i wanted to guide you today -- the question : what are the intentions that are coming to use when you design something ?
and so i said , and my colleague sebastian thrun , that there must be better ways .
and we were successful .
i &apos;m going to give you one fall .
he &apos;s going to be in the right position , and she &apos;s going to be with his nose and beat it .
we learned the first surprise .
it had to give a kind of a kind of a design of the way that we see the difference to create the amount of power and the speed that we observe and the system of the system .
a load cell measure forces and that &apos;s actually a cell load load with a crystal inside .
this is the most popular -- here &apos;s the heel , and that &apos;s going to hit and hit the load cell .
a very , very , very , very , very simple solution for special problem .
and elegance : it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean .
i think that &apos;s one of the most beautiful classical music systems ever built .
i don &apos;t know other people &apos;s favorite , not even more inclusive , which is just to benefit that this is a three-dimensional space .
now you can see that -- he just walks me up .
the submarine , the last year was this one .
and the idea is , the understanding of architecture is a rather empowering , a , happy , excuse me to be the obvious example -- is not the right approach we have to choose .
basically , new york has been built on the back of the street , our streets over their shells .
in these eight side chambers , small ones are small , which is basically the most accurate .
so you went around in london , and she was overwhelmed with this smell .
finally , snow created a map of the outbreak .
and that &apos;s what every second week happens .
i made her portrait on the top of the temple .
and in this area of the amazon , in the 1950s , the oil was discovered .
the other side of the field is torah , where it &apos;s actually osama bin laden . that &apos;s the most salient .
this was one of the great things .
this is the most popular . now let me move and show you the hubble field field .
but then you get to jupiter and the one is 40 minutes away . that &apos;s a problem .
this is going to be part of the way that it &apos;s going to understand the universe .
we just have a million galaxies .
so the stuff that seems to white in the picture is dark matter .
when you saw this picture , they don &apos;t see much in it .
this simulation was taken over 1,000 processors a month , just to make this visible .
with a computer level , we hope to hope to give us a resolution that is roughly the same image of the earth that you can actually see the complicated patterns of the earth .
and we &apos;re of course getting stressed .
47 percent .
that &apos;s crazy . we &apos;re doing it all the time , even in the day-to-day life .
i got out in a vicious cycle . that led to many pain and problems with the joints so i could almost hold nothing .
i asked myself , could you be creative if you search for the constraints ?
this is not happening from the morning .
it &apos;s an obligation from the grid , as well as a kind of a traffic model , and there &apos;s a stable monitor , and it &apos;s a stable monitor of environmental implants .
stalin &apos;s famine &apos;s famine &apos;s famine , who was killing the world &apos;s office , killed millions of years in the &apos; 40s , and in the &apos; 40s , they were looking at the nazis , the most threatening , and a lot of the women were exposed
that &apos;s what the grief will bring . &quot;
and as a psychologist , i was excited about the idea that what we learned in the virtual world about us , and we had our identity , could use a better life in the real world .
we used to be used to a new way of being alone .
human relationships are inappropriate , chaotic and recyclable .
it &apos;s the way it &apos;s going .
because in the moment , in the people alone , even for a few seconds , they will be more comfortable , cooler , they get to reach for a electronic device .
but we &apos;re in danger , because in fact , it &apos;s the opposite .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently , we didn &apos;t have any with the internet bank that some of our students predicted , and quite often -- quite often , i felt that they had given their predictions to financial species .
maybe because of my father , i &apos;ve been reading my father .
so i decided to do it in quiet -- but it &apos;s very cool and it &apos;s alarming .
and finally , i thought a pyramid , but i &apos;m missing the time to take more .
although you lose , no fear of failing , if we &apos;ve given all of the time . because who can be more demanding , if you give it more to a person , what he &apos;s going to do is to give it a little bit of a difference
if i call it names , i never know about it .
did i have enough school tools ?
the second challenge would be cells .
today , in many clinical trials , different types of stem cells are used for heart disease .
only last month , it &apos;s been done with this technology that &apos;s done to show human development .
we can map them and to analyze 360 degrees and analyze the kidney , and then we can analyze this information , and then print it by a second , and scanning it by a peer project .
i couldn &apos;t regularly go to school . i just went dirty .
i was a kid , i said , &quot; yes , i want to do this . i want this surgery .
you may have noticed that a new area is called it , which is a fixed area .
and connected with this kind of carbon , there was examples of all the world -- from the choice of a president to the most successful wikipedia and everything between that -- that showed the power of a lot of things .
third , more powerful , low-cost environmental issues .
because what you need is the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want a cd , i want the music to play .
i mean , joseph and i &apos;m a chair in kenya .
we need to have our women and children , we need to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve the infrastructure .
late the night , i went home with batteries and ice .
together , does anybody have a little bit of a clip ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , to give up the master in moscow and work on a full-time basis of this .
so , this can be huge spending , but if the city can win a number of x volunteers for y hours , the most important thing is the most important part of the city &apos;s work .
they have a lot of the tables , tables and data .
so , these are , in the 18 minutes , to tell me to speak to you here between two and more of the people who are going to be in cities .
and he was in a cave cafe .
the buildings here have several stories .
these green things in the foreground are mangoes .
and if you &apos;re a legal fuel , you have political activity .
i couldn &apos;t know that i would be part of a technological revolution that would let that dream be true .
think about it . these men who didn &apos;t have the same as i helped me to acquire their own support , to get away from their own supportive lives .
and then , in the back time , the most commonly working with a computer factory , but by using a laser bank , and he used a machine , he could develop a machine that could read every single one of the most willing .
but you know , i find it very lonely to let me read from machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books over the border , in the different coffee countries , different versions of the world &apos;s unseen countries are going to be different versions of the u.k. : u.k. , united states , australia , and new zealand had to have
the most powerful . lifespan has been doubled since the last time , and it grows with a speed of five hours a day .
another thing . i want you to do people like me , okay ?
secondly , the new machine is a good news , because once the glory are taking work , we don &apos;t need to do that anymore and we need to get more educated and more inclusive .
the social challenges because of these inequality should be addressed .
the economic game is surprising , and surprisingly straightforward , especially in short view .
and my biggest concern is that we create a world with a technology , embedded in a slightly more responsible society , and supported by an economy that inequality is affecting opportunities .
in the course of the years , i started feeling increasingly more troubled with this notion of god .
some have a few people who have only a god , we can just believe in a god that challenges our pain .
the second of the second is the wind , the wind and waves will obey him .
so who &apos;s god , if not the big bang or a big internet ?
the loving soul of the universe .
by seeking the god in the inside . by presenting my own cliche .
one of the first things i started studying was the story of the most of the technology &apos;s technology .
we have no idea of the more than 40 years old , and the average age of this extinction and the senior tribes is 20 to 30 .
our body has used to be used to these new nutrition .
so this equality and matter , the einstein showed up and also the modern science of the world &apos;s population , the entropy and information and energy and energy and energy all together are connected to each other , so it &apos;s a long continuum .
this is a robot who wants to plug his own plug to get more electricity .
and what i mean with that is that we &apos;re looking for her a new job .
a great development that started billions of years ago , moving through us and continues to be further , and our choice is kind of in technology , is really in the process of that , which is much more powerful than we are .
and they said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got five classes to 40 students to 40 students .
we took this down and we found beautiful , beautiful bars , and it had the appearance -- while we &apos;ve said , &quot; you know what , it looks like the hull of a ship . &quot;
so we waited , we sat on the tables and we waited .
there are many more sophisticated things . the only problem , especially for the adults who work in a , which is not really known as they started , that there was only a toilet .
the teachers we work with -- everything is different for teachers -- they tell us what to do .
about 170 tutors worked with them , and this is how it works beautifully .
and right behind -- there &apos;s a little chain there , usually , you saw a little chain , and you &apos;ve been teaching kids to be teaching .
there &apos;s also this kind of high-tech -- it &apos;s a shelf that you don &apos;t see when you &apos;re in the blink of it , but it opens up slowly .
he &apos;s a lot of the time . he &apos;s going to bring his cousin .
he &apos;s a email , he &apos;s going to ask you any question that you can tell you .
i was this girl .
80 percent of the refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s one side that thinks that peace means the end of the struggle , and there &apos;s a side that thinks that peace is the creation of schools and jobs .
she sent her children to school -- found a new home .
there &apos;s also one , which is the manual for full idiots , you know ?
in cape injuries , there &apos;s a street street , and we all can drive here .
that &apos;s my baby &apos;s baby . thank you very much .
he basically said , &quot; i &apos;ve designed everything . &quot;
and in a certain sense , i felt bad about that .
so i came up with this kind of complications .
i found out that cheetos are very good at the same .
the university is the most difficult , so number 10 hard .
from all in a strange , odd computer story about a window that &apos;s been wired to the window , to the moment that the street was black , and the white gas bag there was in the sun .
and i was reminded by the brilliant presentation of karen armstrong &apos;s point that religion really understood nothing to believe but to do with behavior .
the most powerful , geographically , has seen the same size , it doesn &apos;t look like this , but it &apos;s just the same size as the united states , a field of area that &apos;s about equal as the state of arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the developed world .
we can &apos;t wait for the most popular , the australia had to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of our entire civilization .
a new appreciation of the computer that we have in the challenge of this challenge .
so before i show you a few pictures to watch , i want to point on this beautiful detail about the design of design and design .
rca is really an extraordinary school in this respect .
we &apos;ve discussed this morning with keith bellows that many scientists don &apos;t tend to show something beautiful in their talks , from fear , as a stupid , as a stupid thing .
here &apos;s the fact that you can print the textiles of a grain of fluids in 3d , which is very interesting .
so that makes us think more about what robots mean for us .
no . so i had to think a little bit about a little sharper .
we did the same for iraq .
this was a challenge we had to ask as physicists .
we can press it up . the forces are more than more . there are more of them , but they &apos;re weaker .
&quot; naturally seven &quot; of the whole band .
and there are some employees in foundations that call this &quot; the &quot; machine &quot; .
the idea of justice , which shows our lives , and gives us a sense of what is right in life , what &apos;s really in life , what we should do , social justice .
and as it is , he &apos;s a lot of the time of the computer .
so every week , the most popular thing would come to come , &quot; god , you &apos;ve answered me again . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , an infection , an infection or an operation .
the muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- called the ones like this .
we treat them with the drugs -- the -- the ones that said , frankly , in this kind of pain , they &apos;re not very effective .
now you get so slowly a sense of how much rock we talk about here .
it was 1908 . nothing . so i can live .
i don &apos;t know if you can check it from the back line , and these are just stars .
in 2005 , nasa started a probe called deep impact , which is a piece of a comet , which is a part of the one in the nucleus of a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , like i said , engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a food system and we can choose to change our future .
i &apos;ve led to this time , the only independent , to be exactly the only electronic medium of the country .
and i thought that the most poor , and a great company would be , if the rest of the world would be gone , what was really out of it .
and at the end of the meeting , he says , look , it &apos;s not going to work , you &apos;ll never see your money again . but my foundation will put 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test the idea .
and we said , this is okay , we &apos;re all making you , you know , your business plan with what you actually did .
see , we started in 1967 and central europe with our work and we went to russia .
we opened a little bit for a while .
and we &apos;ve developed the idea , giving bonds , bonds on the free press .
and in this way , you &apos;re doing the funding , so that there &apos;s no more , no blind , the running running around .
so why does something work ? that &apos;s the question .
well , some call this theory of everything .
just example , this is what this is : newton found the law of gravity , which works like a divided through the square of the world &apos;s own objects .
the more symmetry you have , the better you make the simplicity and elegance of the theory .
one thing he thought was the most of us today , but it wasn &apos;t of course to be at the time .
it doesn &apos;t make the meaning of knowing the pollen that they follow , and accidents .
but he read in every free moment he had , books .
and by this ambition , he went back to the prison floor .
but when he was just in the process of putting his signature under the front of the street , his hand was deaf , and he was shaking because he had a thousand hands during a prison scanner .
not surprisingly , it was only three women under the 16 square house in the white house .
but i have to say , the older i became , the more i understand what an incredible privilege was , with this aging lions , as many hours as a man .
and so like lincoln , the story was telling everybody after the war , after the united kingdom .
i asked my father under tears , &quot; what can we do ? &quot;
what the reason is that i &apos;m always grateful for this strange love to the story that allows me to be a life in the back of the past .
he had the temple of the temple and he had a police ambassador .
this is the most popular thing that the lesson is that the jews after exile in babylon , after all the years that they were sitting in babylon , were waiting for the rivers to go to the rivers and to go to jerusalem that these jews were going home
all of these are respected by cyrus .
the cylinder cylinder is from the priests of the great , marduk , marduk .
they all know what happened .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of people living living in iran after tehran .
some know about the living conditions , but they still think they &apos;re a stable sense of bad .
the new oil system cried , crying in the first few hours , but their needs didn &apos;t prepare and eventually they were not worried about to take care of them . within less days , they were failing , and they &apos;re going to take their own , and
a study shows that support support costs 10 percent of a drug cost , as a function of 30 percent costs .
and that fascinated me because i had almost spent my whole life in front of a camera .
you know , you &apos;re very quick to do something that you have to find a answer .
they were shredded people -- most of them , and family .
we heard each one .
but of course he never came . the explanation has never occurred .
and after many , many meetings i was thrilled that this man , jamaica , really one of my heroes and mentors , did it to get the unicef in the boat .
so he said yes , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones who believed in peace and their possibilities , etc . , etc . , and they were actually going to put it .
we connect to the world &apos;s rights -- i met the most energetic , and i said , &quot; in london , it &apos;s about truce .
it &apos;s about their own business , to your business .
the biggest brains of the world should also be cognitively most cognitively .
i went to the literature , and i could never find them .
it &apos;s just a huge primate brain .
and amazingly , that &apos;s what the ancestors have invented before a million years ago , when they discovered cooking .
quite simple approaches to the computer conversations that i led .
and i think i &apos;m just at the beginning .
but once the fight are the physical rehabilitation , the physical rehabilitation was exposed .
behind him , a child , his son , red in the face of effort , his father .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
at night i spoke to my boss in the headquarters and i told them -- i &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; look , we &apos;re starting to start with a few hours every day , just for some repairs . &quot;
two groups of the world &apos;s population started fighting .
so i asked him , &quot; what is it about ? &quot;
&quot; yes , we need to increase the production of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
it &apos;s not just in the orthopedic center , not just in the center of people , but in the houses of people .
and you should see me during a more violent .
and this hospital could have been done .
why ? because the way i &apos;ve taken , i was banned .
but i learned something more profound than that , which is that the leaders of the economy -- the managers of the economy -- were very bad decisions that had brought our economy to the collapse of the collapse .
because i knew that the state of african continent was important for my children and their children .
i &apos;m trying to get the experience i had in swarthmore , to africa .
is my time up ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment from which a great society can rise within a generation .
you will notice that he &apos;s going to be the most beautiful yellow ball , the sun we draw as children .
in fact , that &apos;s something that half of you , more than half , is not familiar .
32 pills &apos; s &apos;s ode .
i think it &apos;s a lot of time . &quot;
and these are the messages that they convey to them ?
because , in the bottom , the sponsors , they love it , and so he &apos;s constantly bringing them into tv .
a professional arm , which talks to dead , it &apos;s not going to be me ?
what is homeopathy ?
we &apos;d like to have a handle of you , like you put in , and you put your race in the world , and you put it in a community , so you can do something .
thank you .
so the whole hospital is often about a generator .
there must be something better . &quot;
but that &apos;s how the user can control whether there &apos;s electricity or not , because you can steer the most powerful on the ground , how much percent oxygen you give your patient .
but we want to be sure that this is the most effective and secure device that we can provide for hospitals .
the different species of writing in africa , the first one was the first time that the script was going to show the script , which is the most secret of a secret society of the most urgent society in the world &apos;s book .
anyway , until 1998 , as a child named john xiaoping , in the most responsible , found in the prison community in the most intractable , in 1800 , in 1800 , the centuries of northern europe were released , centuries ago .
almost one fifth of all greenhouse gases comes from livestock -- that &apos;s more than the traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and the productive to the food line and animals at the line of the line , is not just the order of tools that are so good .
and the most exciting was a central french issue .
a picture of fish fish would be better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t quite bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
some of us would be that maybe it wouldn &apos;t be so bad .
and about a year ago , i asked myself , &quot; why am i , although i know what i know , no vegetarian ? &quot;
you have the choice on the weekend .
you can make a picture with a iphone and all name you get , although sometimes it makes mistakes .
it stays distracted . he &apos;s going to win the race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would be my , it &apos;s about interest , more about it when the business is so high , but it &apos;s a very reactive area .
or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a big piece of artwork .
human nature has to change .
but part of the reason -- and that &apos;s why we have a ethical level in the pursuit of that -- is that it &apos;s also intrinsic .
it could be more complicated in humans , but maybe not very .
jh : is it a liberating to play with these forces ?
and so i knew that i need something to control .
so there &apos;s a lot of time , there &apos;s a lot of the memory , because it &apos;s the dynamic behavior of the liquid .
and so i think that you can be a little bit of the training .
this is a great las studio studio .
we take the pizza , our first pizza , and they screaming the individual slices , while the messenger &apos;s in the corridor and we &apos;re going to get us out .
i was sure 20 before i first went into art art .
i thought , okay , you &apos;ve got some criteria like you want to choose the works .
it &apos;s not a photoshop .
they &apos;re interested in creating alternatives , and they needed money for them , so they decided to make some interesting fundraising projects .
this project is called &quot; the &quot; machine . &quot;
and so we went to the grave and we did this , it was hilarious -- the attention we got .
and she describes how the baby &apos;s office -- everything you say is like the most successful fruit .
he &apos;s a retired man &apos;s native man , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it &apos;s about origami . so go .
people were starting to understand mathematical principles about the underlying rules .
or it &apos;s going to go to the top and do 50 stars on a flag with 13 stripes .
how would you make a single flap ?
we &apos;ve found these rules that we put on circles , you put the air blocks , you put the lines of lines , the extra rules that make the extra rules . that makes the crease pattern .
you can do a lot of things .
but if you want to make it bigger , you could need something origami .
and that doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re going to space or whether you go into a body .
i grew up in a state of washington in the state of washington .
we just have three minutes . but we &apos;re talking about it for hours .
and so i want to talk about that because if we don &apos;t recognize it , this transformation will be very painful .
and in a moment , i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;re going to see in the graph -- it starts in 1973 , just before the women start to cut the labor service , and it &apos;s going to continue to go to
you gave instructions from top .
because i &apos;m writing about all this book , i still have to go and have no answer .
and that was very daunting .
since we haven &apos;t completely processed this information , you come back to us in the form of culture , in this strange and more sophisticated way where you can see that a paradoxical change .
there &apos;s no man or not a woman who is in the middle and the wires are going to be able to get into the wires .
so the personal income on a scale that was kept in the constant way to consider inflation , in this time , more than doubled , is almost tripled .
and to hear me and to understand what i say , you need about 60 bits per second .
and so , in the last book , i &apos;ve been interviewed by the last book called &quot; good business , &quot; i interviewed some ceo that was very successful , and very ethical , with great social sense of being described with great social emotional senses .
control is always a safe thing , because you feel in your mind , but not very much of it .
&quot; where are you born , grew up and went to school ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they had their own significance for what &apos;s home , and they had their significance for community , and even hostility , which was made of birth of birth . they didn &apos;t really have the opportunity to go beyond .
more and more people are also the ability to have the present in the future or the present .
i went down to the room i should sleep .
so , the question is , where is it going to be home ?
there was a big gap between one billion in the industrialized countries and the two billion in the developing world .
but that &apos;s the world we have today . no gap .
and let me show you why , by the way , by the paintbrush , digital technology .
the kids are survival of the children &apos;s survival .
and again , they were better than we said , &quot; you , &quot; you know , &quot; you and your mortality rate of heart disease . &quot;
but if you give people to people , you don &apos;t change the high numbers of heart disease .
and i started working on the work of working with a lot of work , and then i started working with the software of the -- and then i worked with a little bit of the brain -- mice that couldn &apos;t produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my mother-in-law , and of course i don &apos;t know how old she is .
you could be in summer in summer as well as the equator .
certainly many advances , many of the lives .
this is actually real photography , in a time time , showing that the limb is breaking down within less days .
and here you see what &apos;s going on six months later , which is technically appropriate , which is technically appropriate .
a blood vessel is made of two different cell types .
we then ask it back to this oven-like device .
much more complex organs . by the distance , the most complex solid organs are the high ones that are highly nuanced , with all sorts of jamie organs like heart , liver and kidneys .
this is still in the most violent .
we prefer cells that are not fooled and not tumors .
we just need five seconds .
for every problem out there , anybody out there would have an idea .
so i &apos;m right now in panic -- unlike all the marine and sugar , i had -- but this is for a entrepreneur really scary .
that doesn &apos;t mean you have to go to a car company .
i went from door to door and sold flying plate plate .
it &apos;s like a recession . so , there &apos;s a recession .
and you would make this chairs .
that &apos;s useless . &quot; you have to get a way to get faster to money .
i sold a lot of grievances .
they don &apos;t get regular income , but they have the ability to find other tasks and learn them to find the ability of the food , and they learn the ability to find more possibilities .
if you go to a restaurant and use bad , you &apos;ll show you how bad your action is .
these young , croatia .
the development of today &apos;s students is , all of the interests except to take a place on the board .
the most powerful of the oil system or a computer designer on cultural water care is the most of our students .
the values of the past also are called impass . it &apos;s a lot of society .
but it &apos;s a policy of principles , not the most important .
they have a mind . and they have other people .
what we should be involved in when we think about conservatives -- except that case of the 1980s -- what it &apos;s about , they go to church .
yeah , i know you don &apos;t really believe that .
and that doesn &apos;t just lead to another outcome , it has the potential to change how we deal with each other .
totally different .
actually , this is not a rights , but clearly -- let me conclude -- creative commons offers authors a simple way to put their content on the freedoms that they want to leave them .
john mccain .
and i wonder how often happens .
he told me that he was the most interested in the art of the world , and then he said , &quot; there &apos;s a snake in the next room , and we &apos;re going to be there now . &quot;
so , for today , i had the idea that i &apos;m going to run them through this process and show them how this journey looks .
and the hospital and general electric was happy .
i was surviving , just to get us right .
i &apos;m always going to ask people , &quot; is it really possible to use these microbial ecosystems to our advantage ? &quot;
another way of being able to spread microbes is through the people , architects divided spaces similar to the same sign , to the human interaction or exchange of ideas in terms of ideas and offices .
imagine a design that &apos;s taken into account the microbes , like in the airplane or on a phone .
and nobody knew about it .
my company , the , a system called ownership of the apple macintosh .
in 1992 , his essay was rejected by the most popular .
and greenpeace wanted to do this . and a method that you wanted to do , was in this one that was a wall of this humpback wall .
in 78 percent of the voices . to give you a point of the victory victory , and there are two percent of the most popular victory .
and the last message i &apos;d like to tell you is : you can be pretty successful online .
i think i don &apos;t need to explain what a big privilege is , today , to stand in front of you .
this is the school that was built with the community .
something we have in gando are the most populous .
just like this .
good morning . magic is a great way to be able to make the difference of the world , to make the possible thing that the science is really going to do .
there &apos;s the color red and the color black , they &apos;re ready to go to the brink of day .
voice : why not ? that &apos;s a very good slate .
that &apos;s an illusion .
so this is china , a civilization-state , and not so much a nation-state .
but you can &apos;t have a country like china , a civilization-state on the basis of &apos; a civilization , a system .
and the reason is , first of all , the state in china gets a very special -- trust a very special value than the representative , the embodiment and the hippocampus of the chinese civilization , the most responsible .
he was the long way of walking around beijing , connected to shanghai .
we &apos;ve seen this in terms of the simple -- the position of the state of the world &apos;s position rapidly -- or the g8 .
he goes up to the tracks , and he goes along the street , and the cars go underneath .
red = blue = blue = blue = blue cobra &apos;s orange server is purple = the most powerful .
and the first song was in english , the second was on chinese .
she agreed to her song .
i made graffiti , i wrote my name everywhere , used the city as a canvas .
i mean , these were the faces of my friends .
they all accepted that their image would be taken next to each other .
&quot; you mean , you &apos;re a little bit of a face of a face -- you can take a face , right ? &quot;
most places that i went to , i decided to go to the media because i had heard about them in the media .
i took more pictures and we launched the project .
are you a collector ? are you from the media ? &quot;
so the roofs were isolated , a woman , &quot; now , i can see god . &quot;
because that &apos;s a big part of it . there &apos;s layers behind each picture .
but they &apos;ve basically taken me a promise to me .
or , &quot; how can we help . &quot;
if i think about the mesh and what it &apos;s going to drive , why is it happening now , i think there are some factors that i want to give you as a design of a team .
they &apos;ve added a trend .
zipcar started a decade earlier , in 2000 .
it challenges to participation . cities have been welcome to participation of all kinds of different ways .
it &apos;s very cheap , and it &apos;s very , very cheap .
the last 40 years was extraordinary times .
and miniaturization .
this would be a huge amount of energy .
it &apos;s vital that at ted , the ideas that ted is ideas , ideas we &apos;re thinking about , and we &apos;re looking at it , and we &apos;re sure that this is a particularly glorious century and not a matter of the world .
my remaining family are boring academics who are involved in collecting the world &apos;s rights of the world &apos;s worth of food .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet the prime minister . &quot;
i thought he was crazy , but something was really left .
i was sitting there , like you , in the audience .
this is another picture .
netra since netra has been doing a lot of success , it has been done for me .
i started exploring the most popular of the human psyche .
so this time i said , let &apos;s try something else .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much better . einstein is very honored to be here at ted in 2006 , in fact , it &apos;s very excited .
it would be very dangerous if you fall down .
sw : no , i don &apos;t have a problem . you have the problem , you remember ?
sw : big finish .
sw : what about a killer ?

geoff blakley : a little introduction to the computer patent
and finally , the only person who &apos;s third , a young shepherd , and he goes to saul and says , &quot; i &apos;m going to fight it against him . &quot;
there &apos;s the cavalry , men on horses and with a nurse .
goliath is light prey . it doesn &apos;t have a chance .
so goliath is more likely than the time of the time , and usually there &apos;s a explanation for that if someone is so far outside the norm .
and i think that there &apos;s a very important lesson to all of us .
and it turns out we &apos;re covered by a long-term solution , and these microbes are mostly doing good , rather than us .
they all have microbes and the small the periodic lobe , then they used the lesion .
most pills , or the most popular , you can eat , have a or two , maybe five species , and the human community has thousands of species .
we need a computer company for the microbes that live in and on people , so we can understand what to do to our lives .
very many people think about the internet , very much on the english , but for us , it &apos;s truly global . we have a lot of languages .
when you saw it a silly change on me , you &apos;d probably thought that it would be all just in rubbish .
it &apos;s a social concept of cooperation , so we don &apos;t talk much about truth and objectivity .
and we have 40 more , 40 years of food .
it &apos;s not a perfect rule , but it &apos;s enough for the beginning .
and i always like to say that they &apos;re also the only person who actually knows the rules of wikipedia , so ...

in the jungle of guatemala , in the jungle , a temple is a temple .
not known as a well-known indian indian in the world &apos;s hospital , and it &apos;s a nine-year-old in the year , and here it is : &quot; it &apos;s a nine-year-old in the year . &quot;
it &apos;s far below your cognitive body .
we found activity in other areas -- in brain areas that are associated with the computation of profit and loss .
i have a friend who &apos;s just using a terrible computer company .
and i said , i don &apos;t know .
we turn to each other , and we think of our gaze &quot; the emergence &quot; and we &apos;re talking .
tools like looked looked at knives , knives , fuzzy or a little bit of the mine i &apos;d put in a towel .
i had long looking for the wide , but i had never been looking at it near my own .
in some of the most cosmopolitan , they put tools , about sponges to the police floor .
so dolphins can be able to tickle and out of distance .
look at how you &apos;re with your partner and the other side of the other .
but we found out that free dolphins don &apos;t just depend on a boat on a keyboard .
this dolphin called &quot; the &quot; machine &quot; because they &apos;re very ominous about 12 years of time .
but as we decode their natural noises , we also plan to take back to the behavioral system .
and the word is invented .
there &apos;s yves rossy .
and especially if you &apos;re in the most competitive , you have the feeling to fly .
yr : i just try to be just fit .
i &apos;ve been using 20 times in the last 15 years -- never with this kind of wing , but at the beginning .
we don &apos;t tell her a employer .
but it was up to the top , and it was full of cacti .
and wondered , what you might think , as you might , would be explaining to explaining by invisible forces .
because this event was the scientific revolution since the world &apos;s physical world , and how we can adapt them to our needs , dramatically , in the growing , it &apos;s growing .
by the way , why don &apos;t we do that ?
your interest is on assumptions ; our right . &quot;
there &apos;s something like a kind of a narrative story .
and only if a explanation is good , it &apos;s important to be able to check them .
glasses are not very expensive . they &apos;re quite ambitious .
it &apos;s about 30,000 of them currently .

&quot; no one , that &apos;s good . &quot; first doctor : &quot; is you immoral ? &quot;
i thought my career was over .
this is a bear where i sat on the rock for a while .
this is a piece of ice ice , it &apos;s 12 years old .
i &apos;m going to show you pictures of the video of the video , and i &apos;m going to show you pictures and polar bears and seals , but this picture is what i mean , more than any other one i &apos;ve ever done .
people said , &quot; we knew they &apos;re malignant . we knew it . &quot;
and this seal took the penguin off the head and he shook him up and forth .
she swam away , started a penguin .
she tried to get my camera out of a little bit of the dream of every photographers .
paul ornish : stories from a reductionist bosnia
now , you open your eyes .
do you have a ring ?
you &apos;ll focus on this task .
joe , we &apos;re doing this so long until you squeeze it out .
funny , yeah , we have a little man , a little bit of a man , working up all day .
as i said , they &apos;re actually shaping their reality .
first of all , we worked together to build ushahidi and developing .
a call in the united states , after canada , or china , five more , or more of the u.s. dollars , dollars .
it &apos;s built by the way that you can also put a more functional and a half in the remote places that have a lot of remote vehicles .
the time that the buildings were more and more and more and more , the more important systems were more powerful , so that the mechanical systems were enormous .
imagine , two americans are traveling through italy .
please , please , all of the people who are contributing to the liberal .
the best definition of the &quot; s &quot; i know -- it explains so much -- comes from the ted hall of gary kahn .
it makes us very , very old boxes .
but look at the other three lines .
aren &apos;t that easy from the foundations of the internet and the most responsible and more responsible ?
she went off upward and kept on .
and they say , &quot; hold your laws away from my body . &quot;
and we have the signs of the dna of the right , the liberals &apos;s liberals -- and both work together .
and so the answer , my opinion , is to use this passionate commitment to truth and try to turn them into a better future for all of us .
but if you &apos;re responding , a lot of other people in the environment are innocent , but also , you can be hurt , but the military would like to talk about damage .
we look at something else , &quot; and apparently impossible , that the situations were really very similar .
is anybody a commandment , how often do you think , how many people have been introduced , how often the police in queensland were studying o.c. spray at the time ?
there was only a few people shot in this incident .
it &apos;s 72 and it looks like this is the most powerful way to deal with her .
and if you &apos;re making it , people will give them a little bit , but they should not cause a memorable amount of damage . &quot;
we &apos;ve started organizing makers of our &quot; maker fair . &quot;
so , more attractive bass , or something like that .
and i &apos;ll tell you more about it , but just ...
but he also moved here to other people who did the same as he did .
this is &quot; the &quot; machine . &quot;
and we need to bring that into the schools , or in the community , in many , many ways -- the ability to make the world to shape us and to shape it .
there &apos;s the glamour of physics .
and in fact , we see these online photos of stars that are all the time -- they call them the water .
it doesn &apos;t look about one way , but you have to be mentally aware of the world .
vertically , which is an active winds , are glamorous .
but it &apos;s always going to be a illusion that if you buy this lamp , you will live in a world without any wires .
the perfect computer system -- it &apos;s scaling by the perfect chain , with the perfect entry .
because glamour can be very illustrator and deceptively .
but i also knew how hard they worked for the whole week .
i did this many strangers .
i heard about women who were being pushed into their beds , or documented in their dorm rooms , like dead left on parking parking , burned with acid in their kitchens .
then i got cancer -- or i found that i had cancer .
my friend was doing this big bowl , and i asked her , &quot; what is this ? &quot;
it was for me to be friends of friends and a loving sister .
because we all are so poor , we think of the inner experience of our fellow beings and their secret intentions . &quot;
children need a long time to get the system out .
rs : whoa . -- now joshua &apos;s going to go to the end of the way to drink something .
rs : should ivan get trouble ?
and you have it in the coffee of her girlfriend .
and i &apos;ll show you that it &apos;s a little bit of a matter of a computer .
please tell me that they don &apos;t get to be a lot of the pentagon , and we say , &quot; well , the pentagon calls the pentagon . &quot;
but why do you have to feel something ?
and it was , you know , a course of a little bit of a business .
and second , is it possible , or even even the diagnosis of being slower ?
they want to go back to a slow rhythm .
and norway , sweden , denmark and finland are under the six more u.s. countries in the world and work hours where the average americans were going to envy heart .
but the new idea that &apos;s revolutionary idea of the world &apos;s engineering is that there &apos;s something like &quot; good slow . &quot;
i &apos;m stuck , the main thing as a problem of a problem on my favorite , and it &apos;s a lot of time to tell me about them because they were so slow and i wanted to be quickly .
and so everything took his beginning , and they said , &quot; you can &apos;t build everything on a island ; part of it must stay on the bank , because we don &apos;t want to isolate from the community . &quot;
i worked on months and i didn &apos;t work with it because i felt that people who came from the historical museum are already full of load of load , and if you see a museum , they wouldn &apos;t process it .
when i flew home , the most popular was planned .
but you see the uniqueness of the environment .
moshe pizarro : building the uniqueness of unimaginable
and if christian was playing a note -- play a f.
so in jazz , the most amazing thing is absolutely amazing .
it &apos;s not about my vision , or something like that .
am i interested ? do i exist for you ?
they had to go to come up with a lot of time .
in the summer , india is going to be extremely hot .
and the adult animal , that comes to life , or two months .
i didn &apos;t know that , but i know it today . these are hundreds of oecd sites .
and this made me a little bit curious about this . i &apos;m going to hear here , because i want to ask you . and here &apos;s a lot of people who have -- of course , people who have spent their childhood here .
so , next i was on the phone .
october , november , december . this is not the time of the northeast monsoon .
okay , they put their eggs on the seasonal rains , while the most successful .
last week , it &apos;s been the first time , the most popular , and now it &apos;s raining it .
quite incredible , incredible education .
incredible . this is the most powerful journey of a nuclear war at all . a pretty incredible journey .
i made this out of my life .
and everybody thought , i would be good . but on the new terrain i was terrible . people said , &quot; oh , he &apos;s -- oh , what &apos;s happened with a metabolism ? &quot;
and i looked at my surgery in front of my surgery , and i asked them , &quot; how do i do that ? &quot;
next -- oh , pay attention . these guys are the community .
so i was pretty successful . and if you &apos;ve done all this , what is it that &apos;s going to drive it ? i &apos;ve told you , and i &apos;ve told you , and what does a lot of you do ?
in my last tedtalk , about seven years ago .
but carl norden really cracked the code .
whenever the norden bombsight gets brought into a plane , it &apos;s accompanied by a series of a row .
the chemical chemical industry on the surface of three square miles .
after the war was over , there was a fibonacci review -- like the army , the air force , and they put the question : how many more people have actually destroyed ?
i described the opposite of a success story .
a walk in a city or such a journey , this diversity of human species , is in an amazing way .
we ask the human own path .
but what data is based on ?
imagine that you have to clone .
it was a africans who is based on the world &apos;s diversity of the world &apos;s diversity .
the sahara was much bigger than today .
people who are killing the animals who were getting involved in the animals they were flying in the most vulnerable , went north and followed by about 45,000 years ago in the middle east in a rare eastern period of sahara .
the human genome project , the carbon system on mars .
we know deeply in our hearts that the universe doesn &apos;t move from mush to complexity .
so here we go .
what you see here is the blue areas are cooler than the red areas .
over smaller distances than gravity works , what explains why they and i are smaller than the stars and planets .
they &apos;re familiar with the double double helix of dna .
let me explain why .
in the last 200 years , something else happened .
maybe you ask yourself , &quot; what &apos;s the talk ? &quot;
we &apos;re not so good when it comes to the insurance supply .
and then you have to decide how to invest in your 52 choices , and you &apos;ve never heard of a car .
at least a wonderful study has predicted that .
but if you get the driver &apos;s license , you cross the box , if you don &apos;t want to donate the organs .
the other group gets two apples , one will catch .
save more tomorrow , it just does .
this is just one example .
it &apos;s a song about a so-called called a tool called a creature , which mimics a creature that is imitated again .
hi , who is there , please ?
thank you .
and the knowledge has too much impact on the life effect .
i &apos;m trying to get time to the time .
so what did i do ?
we invent stories to explain our existence .
so what did they do ? they sent her walter raleigh to separate their human part of their divine part .
are you given a child ?
elizabeth : come out ! get out ! get out !
i went to visit a friend of mine , and he sent me to his apartment in the inner-city hill in the 20th hill , a really very rich area in mumbai .
everything is a contradiction .
we lived from less than a dollar a day -- about 15 years .
and you have to use nuts from the rainforests to show that forests are more worth as forests than the most than a mass of the world . &quot;
he said , &quot; you can &apos;t wake up a person who says to sleep . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about people ; it &apos;s about life systems .
if you &apos;re in a limited planet , if you &apos;re going to be sustainable , how can we reach this ?
coke has to work with pepsi .
these are nine of them .
at the end , we had , i think , 60 percent of the world &apos;s world &apos;s gdp and 25 percent of the world &apos;s population .
that &apos;s not important .
but they don &apos;t just buy the juice ; they &apos;re buying the carbon in the trees to get the most marginalized of the water to the surface of the product to the motor .
so , the communication between brain and spinal cord is interrupted , and this leads to a full and permanent paralysis of the leg .
after several years , we &apos;ve managed to develop a electrochemical neuroprosthesis that puts the nervous system of a sleeping fly in a rock state .
we &apos;ve been working on 10 years to get this goal .
after a few weeks , we &apos;re putting an programmable pump to inject a individual individual , directly into the spinal cord .
and i was a kid of the work team .
he talked about the world , as she &apos;s , &quot; and the world , how she should be . &quot;
and by doing that , these women are doing lots of obstacles from the way .
in the white house , and the desk he &apos;s sitting on is called &quot; the &quot; machine . &quot;
the last day , the woman who was doing everything , and we were talking about it , and suddenly she said to me , &quot; would you sing me ? &quot;
for this , this is a computer company on the voice , because it &apos;s mysterious -- how to see -- it &apos;s completely spontaneously , and it &apos;s originally .
they didn &apos;t have anything .
so the internet needs the internet and instructions .
one of the most popular websites in the world that are run from the most powerful company in the world , and there was nothing that was going to have youtube or google against it .
and today , wikipedia is so ubiquitous that you can even find them on the maps of restaurants in china .
and that &apos;s what got wikipedia understood .
this is a blog that &apos;s devoted to the most energetic .
why ? there &apos;s a double business of water .
the world ended up in the 1990s .
and we see that the impact of the ecosystem in some countries are very , very strong .
all of this costs money .
and it was done a lot to give students to the other people with their favorite , or from social weak families .
how are schools in the media represented ?
in bureaucratic systems alone , teachers are going to leave in the classroom and have a lot of plastic points .
some people say that the change of the dna is a very , very much like a viable one .
but if you look at the problem from this perspective , you see what happened in the last 60 years .
and i went to the entire morning about 15 miles to get the most successful .
so this was obviously a computer device .
we could also do that with phones .
so a business is coming for them .
&quot; the government must be economically beneficial services . &quot;
it was once , long , long , long , when i was 24 years old , and i was at the time at st. john &apos;s medical college .
and you can see my card when i &apos;m going to put it up here .
and i also bring a invention .
now we &apos;re in the 1930s , and you see that japan is going through a time of war , low life expectancy .
and they decided not to invest in health and education , but also started to grow the economy .
washington , d.c. went outside .
not the bubble , not my bubbles , but the financial bubble .
will the whole world really be quite a fully fully fully changed global economy , and the power transition from there , where it was over the last 50 to 100 years , back to asia ?
the rest of the diagram is a very mysterious substance called dark energy .
but that explains the presence of all the mass .
and now they pay attention to the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe -- three-dimensional space .
again , this is a kind of a kind of conceptual model of what &apos;s going on during the most violent .
they move apart , because the space becomes larger .
by looking at things like galaxies -- their favorite , as many of them are as a function of time -- we can get in experience , which is the way that dark matter and dark energy are fighting in order to form structures .
the big questions in physics .
sleepy , you guys , boy : the legendary oscar -- new jersey ?
so , recycling and automatic are here .
marc blakley : 1.3 million reasons to reinvent the world &apos;s population
and in fact , there was this change in gay men in the united states during the 1980s .
it &apos;s a disease that kills a lot of adults in africa , and also many children .
in uganda , we see that the prevalence of the common effort .
so that &apos;s really similar to the other side of this .
but openness and connecting a price when we think about diseases . that should not be a surprise .
coffee is uganda &apos;s magnetic lobe .
emily ornish : again , aids &apos;s statistics in africa from a economic perspective and comes from a economic note : all our knowledge about the spread of hiv on the continent is wrong .
but i was fascinated by this because i observed this kind of engineering maker .
he was called &quot; the &quot; police cream , &quot; because he was in front of the front , but every time he was walking into a tunnel , he took a plastic factory on the floor , and then , in the tunnel , there was a kind of
these pixels are working on the water like a magnet .
we then ask ourselves , why are the membrane going away and why it takes so much electricity .
for example , in the most competitive of the world &apos;s office , in a material .
in the field of ice , my favorite , working with the computer team , we work with the most successful architect .
janine benyus : biomimicry &apos;s practice
&quot; yes , but why ? &quot;
we were four , not a boy , and fortunately , not a young boy .
you can &apos;t do anything about it .
it &apos;s never going to happen in india , because it was once and never again .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s pray . &quot;
this was a $ a car for over 1,000 inmates in this prison .
secondly , it &apos;s about the most profitable movement in india .
so let me tell you about a project that we did a few years later , a kind of a captcha of captcha .
it &apos;s basically done by the way you start with a old book .
the number of pages that are used is actually so high that the number of words we digitize a day is very , very large .
some are more fun .
now , the web is divided in several languages .
then my favorite question comes from .
there &apos;s a way to beat two flies with a jump .
but what perhaps is surprising , which is the translation that we get from the most responsible , even if they &apos;re just a beginner that we &apos;re getting , as well as the professional professionals , and that &apos;s very surprising .
because people are learning to make value , they don &apos;t have to pay with money , they pay with their time .
the site , the company , makes the business , what you really can do .
the active participation to the active participation is all other than normal .
and zipcar offers a very popular , more powerful service , which works fabulous .
for aristotle , happiness was the highest good thing to come up with all the other things .
maybe these people are right . their thoughts , i think , is not good .
10 percent of time in time , the thought of -- -- sex .
i played the violent african , the african terrorists .
well , from the first time , no explicit honest -- it had no one reached the absolute majority -- so the elections were continuing in a second round of three weeks later .
now here &apos;s a more interesting comparison .
so i &apos;m moved to la jolla , and i learned surfing .
the people in the 17th century didn &apos;t really know how we do it , that this stuff is a bunch of different molecules , and that we &apos;re breathing from a certain reason and so .
and so , charles , i will give money to you , give you a building , and you can meet you , but you don &apos;t talk about religion .
reality is what you can see .
i thought everybody would do something like this .
just to see what would happen if you mix the two .
so i have something that &apos;s not personal .
if you want rich today , entrepreneurs will be entrepreneurs .
they say , if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , it &apos;s not going to go -- it &apos;s not going to be at all . we &apos;ve been measuring it for 20 years , and it &apos;s not moving in .
diane kary : the basis of modern science : the experiment . he tells stories from the 17th century and from his own family in the garden and the curiosity , inspiration , and caring good science in all their shapes .
i wanted to represent a simple kind of living body , which is the kind of this kind of thing that we see , beat up rooms .
&quot; naked city &quot; is a nickname for new york and &quot; the &quot; s &quot; , which is the most profitable and the most responsible , which creates the sense of the experience of the world &apos;s experience .
i love traveling , and berlin has become one of my favorite classes .
and the whole time i haven &apos;t seen a single rat at any of these places , until recently i was in the london channels .
the first question is , and maybe they write them on a sheet of paper , physically , or on a virtual sheet in your head , and , for audiences , you can also try this : you can try this one .
and we then break out , &quot; we &apos;re the best scientific college in the world , &quot; because of our british hubris .
except , you &apos;re talking -- well , at their latitude , they thought , &quot; hmm , what happens during the night ? &quot;
and one of the most difficult problems , if people have a notion of how everything works is it &apos;s pretty hard to change this .
and as an expert for inorganic chemistry , i have friends and colleagues , which are different between organic , living world and the inorganic , world &apos;s world .
and you can see , he &apos;s poisoning , it &apos;s growing , it &apos;s growing in a way .
we even have amazing life forms that we can manipulate .
and darwin himself asked himself to a colleague who thought life was probably done somewhere in a warm small pond -- maybe not in scotland , maybe somewhere else .
what is life ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can connect them and literally create thousands and thousands of really large molecules , in the same size , in the same size as dna and proteins , but it &apos;s not carbon in sight .
we want to put them in the environment and we want them to get their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can make inorganic biology and make matter to that , we can actually define that , and that &apos;s what life is going to define .
but there &apos;s another reason why i may be this goal of life : every single one of the things that i want to do is measure it .
and these are the professional female interviewer who are sitting for an hour for a woman who &apos;s sitting on a woman and asked her to ask her to ask her .
i was really sitting on friday , and i was able to see the mortality mortality on this morning from kipp on 84 .
as you know , these economists love the money , they want to always do more and more of it .
as you can see , it &apos;s not a sense of measuring a average average from improvement that was not , and that very fast progress .
but you &apos;re not talking about it so much .
in those of you , there were high , or very high , child mortality and families were also very large , six to eight .
here &apos;s the trace .
whatever is more worth value is more worth money .
yes , i went barefoot , until i was 12 .
and he told them , &quot; well , the most important thing in question .
the whole time was a border of a riot .
and the way i think about it is that the world will get forward , will make a difference , not just for some , but for every one .
... above the knee , yes , that would be hard ...
the most powerful -- it took about 10 years and 700 million dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth is enough to satisfy anybody needs , but not everybody greed .

i went to high school .
when i was in the council of scientific industry research -- 40 labs -- 40 labs -- if two of the people don &apos;t speak , i built teams .
they &apos;re the family , and i have apps in the app app .
it &apos;s about leading old and some old in the 21st century .
it &apos;s still very hot , but it &apos;s not more sophisticated .
and there &apos;s not a lot of pressure , and it &apos;s not so much the movie , which is that the most potent thing is that the average line is not to leave the reactor .
i &apos;m convinced that the reactor i designed here is an innovative energy source that will be great scientific projects with electricity , and i &apos;m really ready to do this .
we move to a living model where the experience is the actual product .
there &apos;s a manufacturer of the most responsible investment that is responsible for the case that they &apos;re going to the forest .
finally , a long time that he &apos;s a good , good advice , he tells his son , he says , &quot; especially , it &apos;s a lot of yourself .
you don &apos;t usually go in los angeles , but there &apos;s a place where you can walk much out , outside that city .
then you &apos;re going to be wrong as a little bit of the point , as a function of technology -- using properties that you don &apos;t have .
when i was small , i was very introverted and stayed for myself .
and then it &apos;s just about to start and then build it to the very conclusion .
so i built it out of concrete , because it doesn &apos;t matter .
this was this tool .
and for me , this is the most important thing , because since i was a child , i wanted to convey my passion and love .
25 days : the limbic , the canoe , is developing 32 days : poor and hands , the primitive spine starts to train these weeks , where the fetus &apos;s the fastest .
the complexity , this is building in a single system , again , and beyond any understanding of math , or any of these things today .
because apparently , there &apos;s this unstable carbon system in the atmosphere of sun-like stars .
so what can you do with these spectra ?
and a colleague was a colleague of berkeley , a colleague , a very interesting spectrum , and asked me , &quot; can you look at this ? &quot;
there are two ways -- over the world , and the other stars -- and the other thing that matter and chemical elements in the universe are made and can be patented .
because can you imagine everything is all the time ?
now imagine a object , an incredible object , or something that we can &apos;t explain and we &apos;re just standing on and say , &quot; let &apos;s give it , let &apos;s do physics . &quot;
and if we see the oxygen , and oxygen , i think we have the perfect e.t. .
i just said , &quot; really ? &quot; and he said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what i can tell you about this is : it &apos;s universal ; we all have them .
i &apos;m just addicted to the steel , but that &apos;s another talk .
that led to a little breakdown -- -- actually , that looked like this .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is that this is not a matter of a matter of a game . &quot;
what are you going to feel vulnerable ? &quot;
i &apos;m right , you don &apos;t have right . hang on .
we do what we do , not the implications of other people .
people are going to get their meals in twitter , the matriarch of their children on the iphone .
so if we think about it , they &apos;re using to use systematic improvements , and we think about how they can be useful to our energy systems , for our environmental systems and self-awareness .
and today i want to talk about one of the things that we decided to do at the time , we wanted to find a new access to health care .
so steven is sharing his story . but he &apos;s not alone .
here &apos;s why people pray .
i also love this kind of thing that &apos;s been the only kind of insect therapy , and that was the only single one that was online and available .
and here we have a paper .
you don &apos;t have any data , you don &apos;t have data , you don &apos;t have a scientific approach .
this is the curve of the car .
but my brother didn &apos;t go to the end of it .
if we went from here to the ted center , we would go to something that 300 meters high , 120 miles long , and that is two gigatons miles wide and that weighs two gigatons .
to change the state , you only need two volts of a laser .
we said , &quot; can you build that ? &quot;
we can do better .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that comes from what &apos;s called the so-called design .
so , the networks are ideals of the brain &apos;s greatest computer model .
and it also has implications on the systemic risk .
so we could put a computer service in every ranger .
we see the emergence of the technology , and we &apos;re seeing the design programs that make sure our own world from the point of complexity from the complexity of complexity .
so , the first thing is , a drug capacity has a capacity to use with plastic sheets of water -- except you use expensive pumps and valves .
and we had a lot of these kinds of plastic classes .
without human , it &apos;s a human .
so we were up on our lab lab .
and this graph doesn &apos;t even mean something that &apos;s invented data .
and my brain is very quickly thinking that this is a very , very quick representation of negative to positive in the world .
because this question is going ahead of our external world , the truth is that the truth is , but the truth is that i can predict 10 percent of the human being in a person if i can put their entire external world .
and this is a research of research for two reasons and it &apos;s wrong .
we &apos;re moving people to write their own , a positive email of the computer , or the most responsible email of somebody in their social environment .
so , hard to say -- a more powerful , you understand -- my dad was the most salient man in the world .
and so i went . i went to mit .
they said , &quot; stop it . &quot;
they take a huge disk out of cardboard .
he was the first digital media technology in tokyo .
listen , what ? how cows ? this is 4 a.m. in logan .
so there are all these things , but most of the love i do , i think , to taste the world .
and i would put this with passion .
their culture is not coming in schools , and i want to illustrate the way we can overcome this problem .
it makes you nervous because girls don &apos;t want to go to schools where there are no boys .
and over little moments in my life .
or mothers , who raised boys ?
we need to change the posture of young people in elementary school .
and you have the impression that you believe that would be okay .
let &apos;s see where we &apos;re going to have this hypothesis .
is that a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we think that we can do the &quot; why &quot; rules of rules that can give us the basic principles of nature .
i &apos;m going to try and get a ride , and i &apos;m also excited if it works .
and that was really a important lesson for me that you can &apos;t really act on the object .
we &apos;ve created a newspaper , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s a radio connected with my ipad , and this is a software that &apos;s going on on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a computer company , so i added them to a computer , so that people react to the glass of the glass , if you &apos;re on them .
i &apos;m going to get from my current , in a middle-aged age , and then in a old man .
at halfway extra , it &apos;s been allowed .
radio : what do you think ?
just fold the wings together and drive it .
so , i &apos;m going to ask you another question .
and he had a royal hindu system , with a professional , who had instructions , and he had a day to go to the secret , but with the secret instruction , he didn &apos;t really do it very well .
because they found that the human behavior is more powerful .
yet , we have to create a clear more sophisticated animal , which is to create this kind of value , and it &apos;s also a lot of fair .
now , if we all have these tools , we have to just ask the question -- and wetlands and the most responsible , how we use these intelligent ones .
they lead the new food system .
they give small , more powerful , more powerful , more populous .
i felt passion , soul and heart , my body left .
audience : no .
sb : no , no , no .
all around us , we can find a different replicator in this gene &apos;s culture , and find a different replicator in this gene &apos;s culture .
they probably bought them .
imagine the world full of brains and more memes than the place for them .
we &apos;re the only ones and the most powerful .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
that was dangerous , but hello .
they use us to maximize the resource of the planet to produce more and more computers , and more amazing things that we hear here at ted .
and will we go through this third danger , how we &apos;ve got the second and first one ?
in collaboration with a computer organization -- that &apos;s the most popular in haiti -- with the ministry of public health , with various levels of energy , we inspected more than 1,500 buildings .
it &apos;s not going to cost us to do it , if we do it right . &quot;
and because i had burn on 70 percent of my body , all of it took about an hour .
we also found that it would have been good , you &apos;d have given me back to the pain of the pain .
and how bad would the punishment be if i would get caught ?
it wasn &apos;t that the most popular people -- the ones who have more commandments -- less cheated , and that the less religious -- those who were not aware of themselves , had been cheated more .
so if you don &apos;t think about money right now , because you get a brand , you make a difference ?
because it &apos;s like this .
i think all of these forces have very bad effects on the stock market .
but you can believe me . i work in advertising .
these are the most popular ones i can show you today .
and suddenly amazon becomes the brand and competing with the reserve , defined , as you want to spend money , what money is , and what it is .
maybe that seems to be too big ?
i don &apos;t have to tell you the audience , i had to explain it , last week , i had to explain it -- skeletons are structures that have a sperm to put from one individual to another one .
and i knew that animals like the most of the world , or even most animals , are not stabilize their tissues by cutting them over bones .
and that was that every skeleton we found in nature was the same kind of plastic that we had in nature .
all i showed that was really surprising about this .
a funny song about global warming , jill sobule .
well , i guess i must be .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a piece ?
and the key , the most powerful , and the benefits of a great education .
the most amazing news of the world is completely about , and ben became a more somber .
so , on the further , what is the area of this character ?
i was forced to leave my home , the democratic republic of congo , where i was a college .
but remarkably , the most successful of the united nations has estimated the wealth of the country on 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not at the destination yet .
they have to be very inexpensive .
but could not be done for this angle of labor ?
they were supporting the governments , and they have a lot of cases , and they also get them .
but let &apos;s take our goal to the goal of our goal , to bring new economic action to the base of the pyramid .
because it &apos;s a whole bunch of these little transactions to make their profits .
he liked sitting on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed .
since the landfill , when sir was a gentleman , and the british society , the u.k. would seem to be the sun .
so , what is fusion ? here &apos;s a little bit more somber .
and this energy is that it burns fusion .
this is how traditional power power is .
we need to make it a power station .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country , and it &apos;s also a big impact .
they wanted to do most of the democracy , but they were all the population that they had in the last month , and they had been trained to a slave officer in the last month -- it was only four percent .
but the people who were going to get the future to the future was important .
so the question is , &quot; what does the male support support for women &apos;s women &apos;s rights ? &quot;
i promise you , she read the message .
nobody can listen to them , they just send a text .
you could see the immediate impact of law or the one of the most responsible speech on a computer scanner , and see what happens as a result .
the flight took 12 seconds and went over 35 feet .
this is unnatural for a rocket .
it weighs less than a more .
from the smallest of the smallest forces of the nature of the nature of nature .
we can afford to do it as individuals , and we can get hearing .
we believe that somebody else , somebody &apos;s favorite , somebody &apos;s favorite , somebody &apos;s worth to solve this problem .
we didn &apos;t flew it in the pacific .
it took 10 prototypes until we had something that really flew .
and so there &apos;s this incredible epiphany of this incredible elation , which is possible , and that enormous serious thing that means .
and we think of our moral target .
and the director was pretty hungarian and said to me that he was holding me mad , and he said to me , &quot; this place is a company . these guys are heavy offenders .
it took several such events until i figured out what to do .
when i started with this program four years ago , my favorite plan was a computer plan of the prison plan .
and you look down , you &apos;re looking down , everything is so small and tiny .
i feel blessed and happy that i had the courage to give my post on my neck at nyu and return to my own country , where i can do this incredible rides with this group of children from ethiopia , morocco and russia .
and how often would my self have to die before i understand that it &apos;s not existed from the beginning ?
and i was a really good dancer .
oddly , these insights don &apos;t mean my most sophisticated sense of self-worth , this sense of otherness .
that was because i had no myself , what was in between .
imagine what kind of existence we could have when we miss the inevitable death of self , the privilege of life and to look at what comes next .
and this is a cafe at the sea in the u.k.
but instead of looking at that , we focused on how we work .
we also discovered that as a form of a structure and a half of the way , we would get through this structure .
but we found that seeds -- this really important project , but that we have , but that seeds -- in the leading botanical gardens are not going to be done seeds .
we worked with a computer factory to develop a seed seed of the seed cathedral so that even if you &apos;re visually impaired , it was kind of like a visually impaired and soft , the piece of landscape that you see here .
it &apos;s actually just the first few lines you &apos;re looking at , and the rest is only for postcards .
the book carries the title &quot; the blank slate , &quot; the popular idea because the human mind is a blank slate , and all its structure of his socialization , culture , education and experience .
well , there &apos;s a number of political reasons that they like to make people good .
it &apos;s still not clear , by the way , whether these generalizations are fit , but it seemed to be able to support the most powerful .
another one of the humanities and the most prolific at universities , who are in most ways in the decline .
well , the other hot iron is the parenting .
and i think you can &apos;t say that better .
i also call a fork , just like this , and you don &apos;t like it , but you &apos;re not suggesting it .
there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no nonsense .
he says , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i think right now . &quot;
oh , i live in a computer program -- that &apos;s odd .
so i asked myself what would happen if we challenge some of these most profound things .
right ?
it &apos;s so -- we &apos;ve explained the war , as a society , every one of us .
you can do the iphone without the people who are the same skin , same circuitry , same keyboard , always and again .
and then it was kept up and heavy and it &apos;s the big and big and big and wide pages .
and i said to brian : &quot; what did tony do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; so , is it true that you &apos;re in a fake here ? &quot;
but how do you sit on a mentally normal way ?
so all the things that had arrived at tony was evidence of his fame , that he was on this new kind of crazy .
he came in failing in failing , and the 30 percent of the workforce , the american cities just turned in the wild .
and i added , &quot; i have a list of psychopathic features in my pocket .
and the jewelry are always the remote aspects of the personality of the part .
and that &apos;s what it was like two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended .
in fact , the trend is the most pervasive of the rest of the world .
and as a result of these conversations , it &apos;s very , very difficult to say , i &apos;m in northern kenya .
it may be that a great war between east and west has been found , and that it was necessary in the framework democracy against communism .
and although the president , for reasons , has made a very , very good job to do with islam &apos;s enemy , though , is , nevertheless , a natural impulse in the other side of the other side , the other side of the other side .
when the treasure in 2000 , you just observed the peak of the best , the scientists for african penguins ever had -- that at this point when younger species were born .
the day after our arrived , two of us were going to have two of us with the space room 2 , and room two had more than 4,000 , more than 4,000 of oil .
we &apos;ve used this method in the treasure rescue again .
and that &apos;s really important because the african penguin was explained a year to a endangered species .
on the top row , on the top row , on the outskirts of a day , a computer factory , in the south african and even before the police station .
people are open to the top of the world .
we launched this campaign -- very comfortable -- &quot; every egg counts &quot; .
this is not a second grade of the second grade .
these lessons came out of the world , abstract .
hillel turned on a leg and said , &quot; what you &apos;re doing is not to do your neighbor . that &apos;s the most popular thing . the rest is comments .
now , that &apos;s not the whole story .
and achilles takes a body &apos;s body and hide it carefully on the father , and the two men see each other and recognizes each other as divine .
this is a view of the cells that really made me work in biology and science , looking at living cells in the microscope .
every grain of sand has a tenth of a millimeter .
you can see these online spots .
this picture was the beginning of the oil .
we all look at the same from inside , believe me .
the walls are made out of 700 millimeters thick , solid concrete .
and that on the left is a x-ray .
it has human associations .
in x-ray , we see all the little pieces of light in the corners .
i had to go to the center of the car , and i &apos;ve seen a really simple job .
yes , they gave 12 monkeys to a week , and after that week , they just used them as a toilet .
the science actually says that we &apos;re going to live forever .
no , i &apos;m a tooth from a tooth .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you . goodbye .
where do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we &apos;re both not in the case of that .
not a professor and a common effort , only two spirits , ready to be ready .
and then my life was okay .
everything i saw in the manufacturing was that there was right intellectual between the most responsible and the most responsible .
would it be time to process information ?
we spent a lot of time , a billion dollars a billion dollars -- you &apos;re hearing right -- a billion of the most powerful , a billion of the most exciting , which he was involved in , and what we found was shocking , but later more .
then there &apos;s dan etete .
we were upset that these companies were rapidly their food companies , and the most important in london , they were very fond of them .
this is too complex and difficult to change it .
we &apos;re going to die all . we &apos;re all going to be old . we &apos;re all going to leave all the sick people .
there are places you can &apos;t go to , thoughts that you cannot think of worlds as you can &apos;t inhabit the worlds .
they have a computer that i think is a new one of the things that i think is a new kind of new school machine .
she made the decision , not getting a more unfair or a more unfair , but your life is devoted to that that this is not happening to other girls .
we &apos;re all refugees .
but you &apos;re going to tell me this thing about the head , and then it happens .
but this is not what you do . &quot;
i miss michael .
he didn &apos;t find that , he was going to be a staff , but he said , &quot; you &apos;re going to the recovery , or you &apos;re going to wake up and die . &quot;
ah ! we &apos;re meeting that secret , the secret beloved . let &apos;s pull it out .
if it &apos;s on the box , which is the most common , it &apos;s going to form .
the characteristics of being able to refuse to see the word &quot; sketch &quot; often in adults that we should eradicate this age of age , if it comes to criticize the age of being able to criticize behavior and irrational thinking .
if i put the ability to put my sister in the house 10 percent of interest that i met on her last loan , i will be overwhelmed with her ability to get more money from me to get it back .
it &apos;s why we don &apos;t live in the dark times .
and the third is all the sounds we create people who are creating the world &apos;s population .
this is after selective logging .
there are many of the most powerful of forestry , which is the way animals have taught us and sing that i was doing a different time .
so that was extremely embarrassing .
and if you wonder how much that is , this is 16 kb here .
so 37 is our audience .
it &apos;s very impressive and a very beautiful concert .
and these are the themes that actually are the heart .
a generation that &apos;s so much more important from video games , when the real world is .
all of these are problems outside my present .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of video games are for our civilization .
finally ! stop ! that &apos;s it .
it would really be good like this .
so , you get fast from the simple to complex , if you do more . that &apos;s what we like .
and then they look at them , and they &apos;re a pain -- i thought that &apos;s a long time , until they explained to me that they &apos;re a little bit more nuanced to think about it .
it &apos;s going to go to the other direction .
girl : there was a bullet and a computer , because it &apos;s two completely different works of paint , and if you fall to it , you may fall , you might fall out .
but we could not train a thousand of new teachers to save our lives .
and it &apos;s a random thing . &quot;
and then , the last thing we &apos;re going to do is change ourselves as much as we have changed the world around us .
that &apos;s going to have incredible implications .
why do they do what they do ?
everybody would want to want the new version .
they affect us too much .
they &apos;re actually going to school at this point .
i &apos;m going to be in order to be just in order to get the words out of it .
&quot; well , yes , &quot; i said , &quot; strange , you ask that .
you &apos;re like , &quot; you don &apos;t need to do that again . &quot;
we looked at that , and i was grateful because she said , &quot; wow ! that &apos;s insane . &quot;
the goal of the project is very simple .
this is completely personalized medicine in the water .
now the answer is a team of a team .
i work with the philips and the most responsible thing that some serious problems that have been in the project , problems that should not have been there .
in medicine , there are so many people who don &apos;t want change , not even right , not even if a nuclear engineer has made the answer .
you can actually find novel solutions that haven &apos;t been seen before , and it &apos;s just very fast and simple .
yes , good , you can get my life to my life because it was because of beautiful , beautiful modes of form .
no , but it &apos;s true : the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i met the most popular .
and i was not asked to draw it , really , cartoons .
thank you .
so , &quot; our lonely earth &quot; brought me all the way to the audience with the audience .
we have a lot of time for the existence of animals on this planet than they &apos;ve been here until we &apos;ve been able to reach the second microbial era .
his impact is the distribution of this very thin , very thin , over the entire planet , and we had a very reactive death of the dinosaurs , death of this beautiful , more common , more common , and so much of the time .
it &apos;s the supreme crisis , the t. rex .
they hate us animals .
this is when material comes from the deep of the earth and the surface , spread across the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m a little bit away from the coast of the coast , what &apos;s going to happen to me ?
they have a crash . they have two options : they &apos;re going to die , or they &apos;re going to be taking hydrogen sulfide and , say 75 percent of them will be saved , mentally .
so , blessing , and curse .
some of you are countries that think that deregulation or not any regulation is the best way to promote investments , provide trade .
the answer is simply : the chinese define these factories as chemical companies , not as a domestic , and they don &apos;t check .
i don &apos;t know what we can do , but i can use my office to bring them together all to bring them together to develop a solution . &quot;
they need a safe environment .
now , we have the idea that it &apos;s the beginning of a new way of regulation , and the kind of regulation of the regulation .
human rights is a very simple question : can i give this one back to people ?
or you can find the young , the young that has put fire on the beginning to see if you can change it . &quot;
okay , ready ? go .
i was fire and the flame .
again , we saw the spoken word poetry of walls .
after the fight , he shook his chest , and he said , &quot; you &apos;re a god . &apos; no , anderson , you &apos;re the god . &quot;
i travel a lot , if i teach , and i don &apos;t always get to see how my students get to their third step , but i had the lucky one to see that their journey was so designed as they did .
my parents have called me sarah , which is a name of a name .
i want to first talk about some ideas that have driven me , to become a more somber .
when i saw that the war for everyone in the world was incredibly extensive , and that the most amazing thing that the computer justice system was going to do was , i wanted to be a photographer to be a war war .
at the same time in south africa , after nelson mandela had been released from prison , the black population was the last stage of liberation .
the next day i went to rwanda , and it was when i was up in the hell of the hell .
after the fall of the fall of the city in indonesia , i started exploring the conditions of poverty in a country that was on the way to modernization .
a hospital of the physicians without borders in a refugee refugee .
the most powerful is so efficient that the military soldiers survive that survive a wound , in this war , is much higher than any other in our history .
so to make sure that little things can be wrong , we have all these procedures in choice .
so you pick up how to do this .
but that &apos;s a broad and pretty difficult topic , so i had to cut myself down .
the size is the population -- there &apos;s a big china here , there &apos;s a big india .
and in all eastern religions , japan was the same thing .
because the death of a child is going to be more born with another child .
and what is the reason in qatar ?
they have a great job .
all religions in the world are able to preserve their values and adapt to these new world .
and then , as all of our generation , we lived in a field of a field .
day eight .
in india alone , my favorite friends were best friends and i started door door with this same picture , to every single house in india , and we made a billion more of the oil .
this is the most salient .
i asked them -- it &apos;s all the most popular -- and i asked them to ask them to ask them .
i think we owe the acquisition of oceanography and ron st. john , i hope , ron is somewhere in the audience -- there &apos;s the founder of biofabrication .
larry brilliant : first , you &apos;re not mad because of the injury of copyright rights ?
have built a computer factory , &quot; the climate group . &quot;
why should we have a positive impact on the world , the world , as a company ?
they save 85 percent of the power that they had used with a senior light bulb .
sometimes people think that 100 percent will be pretty hard , and we had this conversation in the company .
a more useful person paid himself in seven or eight years .
and we &apos;re in ikea , in ikea , in ikea , in ikea , today , 47 percent women , but that &apos;s not enough and we want to close this gap to the high management effects .
there was a equation in my family , about this : if you &apos;re intelligent , you &apos;re not spiritual .
this is , &quot; he wrote , &quot; he &apos;s the integrated structure of reality . &quot;
somebody , the attitude of attitude , and it &apos;s going to take steam from the ears .
we realized the inspiration of our own , the openness of the other .
as usual , i would go back to bangalore and often get a vivid discussions at my friends , where we discussed different issues , while they were being celebrated by new issues , where a drink often costs them to be more than what they were paid for .
he looks for forgiveness , and he says he wants to make life better to improve his child soldiers .
this pakistani seemed to be quite happy , and it had no deaths to impress even though dozens of people have been killed in liberia .
and how are we responsible for that ?
it &apos;s alarming -- not ? -- that the media of the world makes a bad job that a small group of activists in the world is able to publish more of this kind of information than the rest of the press together .
j yeah . this was the cover in the guardian and it became around in all countries about kenya , in the most popular and south african press .
j the effects of people who worked on it were strong .
and there &apos;s a lot of information .
i would be interested in what we &apos;ve heard -- i &apos;m curious about the opinion of ted audience .
and we said , &quot; oh , tell us more .
so you have to be careful with the term hackers .
and only one month , it was passed all the way from parliament &apos;s parliament .
and from all these numbers , i start with only two or three variables .
this piece here can be read very differently , depending on where you &apos;re going to be .
i was reading about this in a complaint , and i was going to be a ph.d. in a complaint , and the most responsible for responsible medicine and seven .
so , according to this study , the best thing is to make a chicken for a chicken , but certainly not too long in the way , but it &apos;s not too long in the way that it &apos;s going to be black , and a rubber gear ,
and then the next summer i worked under the line of dr. gardner at fort worth , texas , texas .
and this realization is incredible for efficiency of chemotherapy , perhaps for many different types of cancer .
for example , resilient is chemical pollutants that are found in our schools , and they &apos;re found in our schools .
because all of these solutions are , of course , they &apos;re sustainable and they &apos;re a lot of the ones -- the way we &apos;re going to go -- the other generations of our generation and for the next generations .
and immediately , a voice called &quot; kangaroo ! &quot;
after the conference , after my talk , people came to me , men and women .
hard !
a prosthetic doesn &apos;t stand for the need to limit a lack of separation .
we &apos;re all different from different perspectives .

we say , &quot; yes , &quot; while we shake the head .
the science has taken a lot more signs on daylight .
look at exactly the same and you &apos;ll see the outer smile in the entire room .
in this way , in this much more powerful world , it can make sense to be a little bit more comfortable in our moral needs .
and that &apos;s not true , right ?
you know , we often think language is the world that we live in , but it &apos;s not true .
so what &apos;s like a computer designer , if not even tragic joke about harry appears , unlike ethnic , as ethnic .
six months after , without any explanation , they let me free .
that &apos;s what i think is useful .

how do you care about the effects that you &apos;re doing on these remote villages ?
i don &apos;t like that attractive as a &quot; animal &apos;s &quot; s . &quot;
they wait to be cut down .
much more people would have been jealous .
today i &apos;m going to tell you two things . first , what we lost , and second , how we get it .
here you can see the largest part of the living of florida &apos;s being in florida .
if there &apos;s no fishing in a reef , because it &apos;s a permanent protected , or tamiflu , it &apos;s great .
after a few years , after five to seven years , the fish come back , food , the sea sea , and then the algae grow again .
you can see the border of the barn , because there are the boats coming out of all .
if it &apos;s so good , if that &apos;s so easy , how much is it ?
so the fuel is the sea , and the ocean has become a nuclear for funding for funds and the food of the world , and that &apos;s not acceptable .
in coral reefs , we found that the pyramid is the equivalent of the equivalent of the world , where five lions come to a solar system .

it has been proven to be the longest creature in the ocean .
they come up to the submersible -- they come to the eyes and watch the eyes in the submersible .
and in other words , we &apos;re trying to start with our partners at woods hole , these virtual world -- the world , this kind of area , to get this out of the lab .
bl : these worms have no adequate ones . they don &apos;t have a mouth .
what we &apos;ve seen was from the pacific .
we &apos;re going to try to show you the pacific in the ocean .
these worms grow several centimeter in the week .
the concept of the internet system is soluble .
and the rest one percent of the world is looking for the formula that you can apply in the situation .
they also have the mathematical structure , which is from the steel structure , measurements , the dots , points , axes , and so on .
the students have to create these models . they have to make them .
and the best thing , or one of the best parts , is that we don &apos;t get the answer from the bottom of the ocean &apos;s rights .
what &apos;s happened to be the small hadron collider ?
here you find the fastest growing young population in the world .
it &apos;s the most popular . there &apos;s no government schools in the slums .
this is a computer installed on the entrance of a vicious social fund called sugata mitra , called sugata mitra , who showed the most popular experiments , and they can learn that children are learning under certain conditions .
now , the key is motivation , and it &apos;s in two ways .
this is a school in a van on a glass in pune , who &apos;s the fastest growing city of asia .
they should turn it into a mcdonald &apos;s .
there &apos;s formal framework , schools , private school , hospitals , where innovation can happen , and informal environments , communities , families , social networks .
every child to age 15 , which is a place in a school , will be able to get in 2015 .
and while i look at him , this scene comes to tears , and i &apos;ve been doing it for 25 years .
here &apos;s a couple of teenagers from teenagers ? all right , we &apos;re going to cook for them -- and they eat every night for two , three or four in . it &apos;s ridiculous .
he &apos;s going to go around and eat everything !
these gay people like me , like i , want to be treated as a fully citizens , and it &apos;s been written directly before our nose .
there &apos;s a lot of fear to do that , so you don &apos;t show who you &apos;re really , here at home , and it &apos;s not just about north carolina ; in all states , it &apos;s legal .
think about it .
and i was scared .
about three years ago , i read a paper in the new york times .
who were my grandparents ?
it helps us to become what we could have .
this is how evolution works .
and in fact , this is an insect .
i have smell one earlier one earlier .
it &apos;s not just about 43 to 44 degrees c , but it &apos;s going to hold a constant temperature .
but the contrast is about to be in about this . it &apos;s going to be the background .
here &apos;s the russians who beat the russians , and yes , it was -- a game .
she started telling me about it , and all parents are going to recognize the most popular .
i have a irish tale .
our lives are defined by data , and the presentation of this data is a chance to create fantastic interfaces that can tell great stories .
i &apos;ve also thrown a look at the different stages of technology , because you can pick what you want to highlight from the data data .
it &apos;s a man &apos;s guy who &apos;s sitting in the box and control this kind of water .
a more 11 sheep an hour of about 11 sheep an hour , which is a rubber student .
in the bottom , you can see -- what you see on the left is the most powerful , and you see on the right side , you &apos;re looking at the frame of the frame of 16 people who had no idea what they do .
selam bell : selam , selam -- aaron , aaron , and we took all these pieces and the most common pieces of light , asking them to another mechanical turk .
but we knew we needed the right person to make us look at it and build it for the one we could build .
and below all the individual frames , people have been installing the project .
thank you .
so i made rows of images , cut , and added them together in the wild .
a memorable consequence of that is that you &apos;re always going to see one piece of your image , and that leads to a very free technique .
and sometimes i have an emotional response to news , like the earthquake in haiti .
then i went 50 kilometers , then 60 kilometers .
it &apos;s like the different layers we &apos;re doing , and what we &apos;re doing is what we &apos;re doing as our identity .
another thing is in a public library in san jose , california .
so every building has its own personality .
it &apos;s perhaps easier to have a good way to get a good way to save .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re particularly materialistic .
it &apos;s just too strange .
you know , in the middle ages , in england , if you met somebody who was very poor , you called this &quot; unhappy &quot; . literally , someone who &apos;s lucky , the fate of the day , not a child &apos;s destiny .
and it &apos;s going to be done with angels and the legends and the heavens , and the sky is opening up .
and i told them the action of persistence &apos;s .
what i think i really think is really , really speaking , is success and failure .
we should make sure that it &apos;s our own obligation that we are really the creator of our own ambition .
alain de botton : a one-way , nut
if you train this sport , she doesn &apos;t smile .
you know , you &apos;re running with a little wet goggles , and you &apos;re running 60 trains per minute , so you &apos;re never really on something else , you don &apos;t see it .
they &apos;re in the liquid .
my breath is down three times the minute .
and i &apos;m not supposed to worry about it , i didn &apos;t make them .
i swam with this thing .
it &apos;s the only one that interests me .
there are already today .
the gateway can be a smartphone , or it could be a special gateway , like today , a lot of these things , as a lot of these things , because they &apos;re not so good .
many of you have the phillips direct life .
this is a bit more important of our life . we should sleep a third of our lives .
ok . now let &apos;s go from sleep to disease .
so we can change medicine in the middle of the age , in all ages , or are children to be able to go to the elderly ; the middle spectrum of the disease is changing , the entire spectrum of disease -- i hope to give you a sense
so , i hope i &apos;ve convinced you -- the effects on the top are enormous and the effects on disease are also amazing in all of these different diseases and more .
how do we create robust societies ? longevity .
and in the novel , a particular , a very small alvin , and he says maybe it &apos;s not the best way , and it &apos;s all the system .
and so there are no adequate ones .
and she &apos;s a great thing .
panic should be faster .
maybe you ask yourself how we do this kind of thing .
our only cookbook is the only cookbook in the world , in the banal nerve .
this is the finished hamburger .
a talk about surgical robots is also a talk about surgery .
and surgeons were more business than doctors .
but ultimately , the woke up .
they had to give up their intuitive movements with the instruments .
i told you about the big complicated robot .
and as you can see , it &apos;s going to come out of something useful to do something useful , that &apos;s not so much of that as valid .
and we don &apos;t even have to be constrained to this kind of thing .
we &apos;re here to talk about accidents .
but we had a problem .
okay , well , it was partly my fault .
we didn &apos;t just show that bacteria can be the solution to plastic waste , but also that the openness to the energy of the world is enabling the more unexpected discovery and that makes it possible .
the film we &apos;re going to see is made for the most successful in new york .
i &apos;m not there .
it went on . they always tried to make things better .
they didn &apos;t say , &quot; our style are curves . let &apos;s make the house curved . &quot;
i think in my family , we had a lot of happiness . because we &apos;ve learned design backwards .
dusk , very good !
ed : and then sit down row , and then the number of historic seats , there &apos;s a very historic site in the middle of the story where the message was in paris , where the message was true .
you see this chair there ? the orange one ? this is the most popular chair .
because it &apos;s part of where we want to get to .
it was a full of outrage . they were full of speculation . they were the ones that were a tough information .
one of them is known : the population population is coming from two to almost seven billion people in the last 50 years .
brent hawkins : being nice here .
you see the lines check out when the population population is happening .
before i talk about the cost , i have to clear that i have very clear that i have to hold it very clearly .
so , liberation , it &apos;s actually looking .
but only recently , we can , thanks to technical progress , now the quantum locking and quantum locking .
first of all , some strands of magnetic field inside the inner , but it doesn &apos;t like it , if you move , because your movements use energy , and so the most powerful people are willing to do .
and of course , this sort of magnet can expand , of course , to form a certain way of forming the trajectory .
and it was inspired by this quote from douglas adams , the situation is by &quot; hitchhiking through the galaxy . &quot;
because of course , they don &apos;t explain how to do that , if you want to do it yourself , and not have a throwaway .
but even though they were not convinced they were , they said , &quot; okay , we call back . &quot;
so , i mean , yeah , i have .
so some of you will say , &quot; what will happen if moore &apos;s law hits its limits ? &quot;
today you can buy half a billion . and you &apos;re even better , because you &apos;re faster .
but where are we going to get the software ?
larry page has thought about our primary speech , in our business studies , which he was doing for this great challenges of humanity .
they wanted the fish to catch .
this may sound insignificant , but it &apos;s incredibly frightening to hear a lot of rumors that one other thing is going to be bigger than the last , and maybe the last 13 o &apos;clock or maybe ...
so the tsunami can be seen as a kind of an aversion moment , a moment where the blogosphere was somehow improving .
probably it &apos;s about three to five percent of the number of bosnia in the glass , and it would be better than the estimate of 90 to 95 percent of them .
somebody has links , so other things link , etc . , etc .
he finished his favorite , and i &apos;ll hold on a 300 pounds of paper at a stage of paper , but he says , &quot; that &apos;s all i want to do . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you now 30 seconds of film , with no one on the skin .
this habitat is covered more of the surface of the earth &apos;s land than all the other habitats together .
many of us , i &apos;m also , including , is that the exploitation of the oceans are only in the last 50 or maybe 100 years , really serious .
these over a cable connected vehicles , and hands for work on the sea floor .
so there &apos;s a barcode on this product that &apos;s telling the computer exactly what the product is .
but i want to share with you some of my favorite discoveries of the census .
we don &apos;t know why they do that , we just don &apos;t know .
this graph is based on a brand article that &apos;s going to appear in the journal of biology .
but that &apos;s not all of it .
as an architect , i have something like that to confront .
mitchell joachim : don &apos;t build a house , grow it !
i think that &apos;s very interesting and very impractical because what you &apos;ve heard in the last few days is the sense of walking in different directions : directions that are specifically and unique for the problems .
well , we all think that the most obvious of romantic poet was obviously a big romantic poet , many of us forgot that he was writing some wonderful essays , and the most famous essay is a poetry of poetry .
i &apos;m going to read that .
and at a certain time of his life , she &apos;s going to be on rocks .
but let me show you the latest robotic technology .
when you used to , before the digital radio , the singer , and the &quot; s &quot; on the body , that was this noise .
the idea of the main idea of the internet is that you have two sources of information that are coming out of the conclusions .
that means i need to make predictions about the future .
well , there &apos;s a very clear example where one of me feel a very different sensation of feeling that &apos;s very different than it was made of a different person .
and then , in the meantime , i got two daughters .
so they didn &apos;t know the rules that the other person plays .
if these dots were on a high-speed car , they would have no idea what &apos;s going on .
we &apos;ve shown that we can explain a big part of the data -- people actually plan their movements to be very precise , to the negatives of the noise of the noise .
this is from the ocean bank of marine earth ii .
mars has the largest largest energy system of the solar system , the most responsible .
this is my favorite . it was just taken a few weeks ago .
the oldest stone on earth is just 3.6 billion .
and the result of our meeting was a nuclear engineering company called ares .
we fold it , and we transport it in a spacecraft .
this is about the food of the oregon , oregon .
i think on the packaging , let &apos;s look at this -- &quot; eight to 12 . &quot;
and there was a guy who was selling these guns for lego , because lego -- the most popular -- no , they &apos;re not on guns .
and then there are some examples of the stuff that are real sculptures .
i have to tell you , i had changed everything .
perhaps most importantly , the impact on other companies is enormous .
in fact , politics is called the water of the .
in brazil , there are 18 times over there , whereas the u.s. only have 700 , and the two years of california -- and within three years , the percentage of the four percent is up to 85 percent .
that &apos;s not a lot of time . biofuels are a really big thing .
scientists tell us -- and these are just estimates -- that we need to take the base of greenhouse gases half , and that &apos;s how fast we can .
i can hardly wait what we &apos;re looking at tedsters against the crisis .
there are fewer people who are still available , and then you can get to the top of the curve , and you get this classic of the curve and you get this classic signal curve .
b is on the edge of the network .
and that &apos;s what happens to each other .
the red dots will be the most powerful , and the yellow dots will be friends of people with flu .
would you get immunity on the ground ?
and there &apos;s , i think , three ways that we can be used to this data data .
the building was built in construction until the collapse of the economy and death of the summer of the 1990s .
even though it seems to be a completely chaotic place , if you look at it from top , there seems to be a whole net of the body , and channels that connect every single house .
in this tradition , the future bride is all their possessions , which will bring them to their new husband .
what a place like the dumbest david particularly does , is this kind of high-tech , where people have a basis to use them .
we can only ask , &quot; how do the most important the police companies of the world &apos;s population ? &quot; and you know , or what else we want to ask .
it &apos;s replaced the workers through technology .
you can see some symbols on the screen , some symbols that show what &apos;s going on with his right arm .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re always getting older .
or even if we &apos;re going to get much older , our cars can go to the order of the people .
they were gone in a moment .
it was increasingly more obvious that we can &apos;t win .
the two specialists behind the curtain will help me to get the result on the screen .
one of the journalists asked , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
the mandatory ones are the same as jewish heating .
i think there are some of the reasons , but there are just a few of us , but just a few of us .
he was attracted by the fire , he hunt her , he was like a golf ball for light , a little bit of a computer .
let me go from the door to the international community , and see if somebody is there , and see if somebody &apos;s sent to police or troops for these figures .
but for sergio , it was too late .
he saw her .
jackie power : a complicated hero
this means jobs and possibilities all along the world .
but today , i &apos;m going to talk about the free of food because it was actually this year , last year , and 2008 during the university of food , for every single year , calories .
and i go into these stores when they &apos;re there , or they &apos;re out of the fields to see what they can get , and i realize they can &apos;t get food .
we see changes of participation in girls .
i want to talk about something that i call digital food .
and what i found is that instead of investing in subsidies and other things , they invest in school care .
thank you .
we could do the same thing in cancer .
they &apos;re not going to go longer to a drug party .
it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a very , a device , not because it shows me how many of the most powerful things i do every day , but because it &apos;s been set 24 hours for a long time , which i do .
that &apos;s never been shown .
the productivity of these magnets is so big that we can see with this technology a single neutron .
you don &apos;t have to shrink the tumor .
if the magnet is big enough , and your resolution is high enough , you can actually all be in the body , and you can start to understand the individual system .
most of us find that creepy , and interestingly , 12 vibrations per minute about the average of a sleeping male .
for example , if i put this -- longer than a few seconds , you &apos;d be getting uncomfortable , you &apos;re uncomfortable , longer than a few minutes , and you would leave the hall in the mainland .
that &apos;s all recognized . and that &apos;s the tune to hear the most common thing in the world .
and i was there with two very good friends of mine , richard milliken and kevin gibson .
as we cross miles and miles from the street , frozen , the most spectacular , the most capable of the sun .
so as i &apos;m standing here today , i &apos;m talking about the most about five years of the world &apos;s worth of about five years .
just 10 miles before the coast and in the north pacific feet .
the ocean is going to determine climate and weather , they hold the temperature stable and shapes the chemistry of the world .
so , there are easy ...
that &apos;s the result when you don &apos;t know that there are boundaries for what we could take the ocean .
for the last three years , the u.s. for example , the u.s. for example , have been protected by the ocean .
we need submersibles , new technologies to explore the ocean .
so a lot of my early career , i wanted to figure out how the wing of the insects are creating enough power to keep in the air .
let &apos;s study this idea of simplicity .
this is a beautiful picture of visual music of a mouse from the lab of jeff , and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk .
they &apos;re a little bit more comfortable to make any behavior , one of the other things that have another kind of different , and patterns and you can think that this is in a very complicated system .
our mission is to build a computer , and make a computer model of the human brain .
he &apos;s home and drinks tea .
if you look at the surface of the neocortex , you &apos;re going to be able to get out of louder components .
how many per match there is there ? where are they stuck ?
we can look at the tissue . and we can change neurons .
we can upload all these neurons , every single one in its own processor , it activate , and see what happens .
the other thing that &apos;s called the secrets of the brain is that the secrets of the brain can be solved . mental illness , memory , perception : they &apos;re made of neurons and electrical signals , and he &apos;s planning to use it with a supercomputer that &apos;s
it would be necessary to be two or three thousand bombs .
the air force started building smaller models , and it started .
this is what nasa did to get a more successful , flying to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about a little bit of a little bit more about a little bit more .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write . because there &apos;s so much resonance that you can get from people .
the bottom ? yellow .
if you ask people that question , they usually think it &apos;s done with the culture .
the countries on the right , the ones that give a lot of , have slightly different form .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this .
but to get it back , it &apos;s more complex .
a 59 hypercard bleeding for 59 dollars .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we really don &apos;t know our intuitions so well .
in fact , in medical terms , this is our view .
and radio waves are limited .
in general , you can only use the eyes with low energy .
their intensity can be more sophisticated , and they can get off very quickly .
they &apos;re critical .
but that &apos;s just the way .
cars have a lot of plastic and the ones and they can communicate with each other and can communicate with the car lights with the cars and so on .
dna is what &apos;s mean all life .
because it &apos;s actually not so many data .
you have the genome of the genome , and the power of this is a custom medicine that is better than today -- it has no side effects .
he &apos;s really simple -- just just just got just just just a little bit skeptical , but we could completely get it completely embarrassed .
we &apos;re not running as small organisms alone in the world , but they &apos;re part of a big ecosystem .
the consequences can be bad -- if we &apos;re poisoning or poison , but that &apos;s just the consequence of one of us being made mistakes .
now i &apos;m basically here because there &apos;s a kind of protest in dog dog , where we have a person who thinks you &apos;re eating a dog , first of all , by making a dog , one of the rules of rules , human rules .
they &apos;re just like &quot; the &quot; s &quot; just beating . and so they &apos;re beaten .
no , we &apos;re doing &quot; puppy , sit . &quot; -- boom , he can try to get it to six to 10 .
these are like golden logging .
and i would say , if you don &apos;t need it , you might not be able to be .
not only with the puppy , but also with the rest of the family .
these are so simple .
their children are just to train .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , and this windmill -- does it work ?
wk : yeah . i still think about working with energy .
because even though i &apos;ve used scientific terms in songs , it &apos;s sometimes very hard to get them to sound .
and still rare , if it &apos;s accompanied by the steel and the most prolific , like in my case .
one is a white flash of light .
64 with 75 multiply .
let &apos;s look at the third question .
the desert continued to expand a mile or two a year .
the homo erectus made the same tool about 100,000 generations of the same tool .
you can teach them in the lab , a little bit of trade-offs , and there &apos;s also a kind of a brain company in other animals , but the exchange of a object is never happening .
it &apos;s wealth , in the pleasure of your needs , to save time .
we have reached the species .
but there &apos;s no evidence for that .
and when people started with objects like this , the way that this was a little bit of a sense of a relationship was that a exchange between groups existed .
but who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
but i &apos;m also , because of the connections that people are taking , and the way that they never have any other way to stand in the ideas , and to be able to mate . i &apos;m also sure that the technology continues to move further and better
this is the size of a building , and i &apos;ve been running the computer &apos;s brains as compared to the computer .
but we don &apos;t talk about it , we don &apos;t take it seriously .
these are just gone , these feelings , they &apos;re gone .
if we think about the most popular detection detection detection , then normally the fast development is the problem because how can we discover things that are constantly changing ?
i &apos;ve talked about that -- you know , you know , this situation , if you don &apos;t get diagnosed ?
what about real people ?
we were covering a part of their viruses ; they &apos;re new , and we &apos;ve got a new array of their viruses .
after 10 times , with fever of fever , she came back -- still a fever -- she has a little bit of oxygen -- little oxygen in your lungs .
it didn &apos;t even sequenced very often .
it &apos;s a classic labyrinth , but it &apos;s completely new . nobody has seen it before .
a huge battery could have this already .
instead , we &apos;re instead of making something that fits to the most responsible of the animal &apos;s brain .
i brought a little bit of density up with a high density of density , a high density of dense down , and a salt salt in between .
but david is young and clever and he wants to make a computer , and so he builds -- he &apos;s building the first metal metal with this chemical composition .
so what do we learn from all of this ?
this video was taken in the north atlantic , and six miles before the coast of the coast of northern europe , about 20 feet below the surface .
quickly , we realized that our garage was not big enough for this growing project .
i started to get to maria , and her methods and how she found this kind of thing and how important it found that kids are discovering things themselves and not taught them to be on a open way .
evolution is often seen as this one , but it &apos;s actually a big number of opportunities .
i &apos;m going to skip this to the stage of space .
our cities are endangered , because many of them are on the coast .
there are stars and so forth .
so if we think about the brain language , or language language , as it is , the social scientists , it turns out , we think about communication . we think about communication .
this is what &apos;s known as a pride , as a proud of jessica tracy , and she showed that dizzy people and birth of blind people , they do , they do , if they win in a computer scanner .
so i thought about it . you &apos;re on these people and you see how they &apos;re involved in it , could you get them to do it and then they get more involved in it ?
what happens in a field of a game , what happens when you &apos;re going to take the stage at the stage stage ? how the following little manipulation of this little piece of manipulation ?
this is happening in the lab . the little exercise , for only a few minutes , where you can really apply this ? that &apos;s important to us .
these things . people are kind of showing me the true one . they show themselves .
she was completely depressed and said , &quot; i don &apos;t have anything to look like here . &quot;
they need their bodies , privacy and two minutes , it can affect the other way in the big scale .
so , swimming swimming , to get to their own , and get a huge ant , and a ant , and they &apos;re going to go up with a blade of grass , and they drive a blade of grass like a jeep .
and you have to have a kind of a kind of conceptual , you have to have a answer .
so it &apos;s like i think richard and i do care that these ideas are not going to be abused .
and of course , they are extinct in the most fundamental days .
but under all these ideas that thank you very much by our technology , many toxic ideas are a lot of toxic ideas .
and as you should do , we don &apos;t try to eliminate them here , to destroy them .
and in my game , it &apos;s called the water .
we put some ideas on the legs , we went international at a tour .
i know you &apos;ll tell me , &quot; t doesn &apos;t exist in the music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
nobody hears each other . nobody &apos;s familiar with the other .
you &apos;ll see the orchestra in a kind of a handshake .
i don &apos;t want to get out of that , that shouldn &apos;t have happened , but that we need to be better , if it &apos;s about answering questions that you need to consider , if you think about the consequences and the reactions .
they work in government . they &apos;re the driver .
five dollars can save a life .
she deserves about two dollars a day , and she &apos;s just going to build a computer phone , and she explained that she &apos;s not going to have married children before these things are done .
finally , from despair , they went and got a wise lady .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , if you &apos;re angry , you &apos;ll be able to keep the best talk you &apos;re ever going to regret .
okay , the vast majority of us .
his message was basically unity , the connection of everything and the unit of everything , and its fundamental value was respect to strangers .
who is fighting , while he goes ?
they have started to go to israel and palestine , in jordan , in turkey , in turkey .
and so more and more , more and more , and it has been a income for a while , and it has been a half to support your family .
just go to somebody , with another culture , from another country , with another ethnicity , which is kind of different and engage it in a conversation ; you &apos;ll listen to him .
i start where the story began , 1985 in the world .
today , before you &apos;re looking at who had the opportunity to shower ?
you see here -- 35 percent of these fewer famous houses , where 50,000 indigenous people live , 35 percent of the houses had a working shower .
21 percent of what we &apos;re fixing are consequences of the world &apos;s rights , things that were actually built around .
we did this . he got a little bit of the job .
we found out later that in this region , failure is the leading cause of disease and death .
one thing is in relation to everything we did , the middle of the computer , nelson mandela didn &apos;t say , &quot; how slavery and apartheid is not an intuitive thing , it &apos;s the work of people , it &apos;s the work of people , it &apos;s the
i don &apos;t feel it if you call me a more unfair . really not .
it sounds really instinctively to say that from here to the top , but if you try to use it , it &apos;s impressive .
and i &apos;m going to show you that , in the belief , that kids should not leave their community to live in a better way .
this is the youngest state of total workforce in america with our transportation team .
this is a picture of the bronx who gave the kids to his house , not in jail , so they felt the same thing .
we gave something back .
if you &apos;re big kids with small pieces of kids , they &apos;re the big fat man in the middle , which is cool , and they create these responsibility under the surface of the , incredibly .
now , you might wonder about these kids .
keep kids away from these stores .
stephen ritz : a teacher who &apos;s going to expose the south bronx
secondly , i bet that even you see the difference in the way that the difference is , you know , the amount of energy is right after this sharp line .
so , by the dawn of 10 : dawn suffered a heart attack .
people with migraine migraine who have an aura , have a little bit of a nervous neuron -- here in red , that &apos;s three to five millimeters per minute .
the problem is that 30 million americans have migraine migraine , and we need a solar system . i think we have this .
my first wish is that the most powerful thing for epilepsy , the most responsible for epilepsy , for the treatment of the treatment -- is used to use a little bit of the acronym of other people &apos;s treatment .
lawyers take cases on the more elegant in the hope of the hope of poles who supports the poor patients of pity .
a year ago , four of the most five of the u.s. scientists were in ushahidi , which is called &quot; the &quot; s &quot; , which is called &quot; the &quot; police &quot; .
how do you know what &apos;s important about that ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i have the first time to get it to this , to get it here .
these people below the barrier i call the top of the barrier , because they &apos;re really going to be excluded from the process to share their knowledge with the world .
they have to use , khaled as a platform to develop their materials and the information systems that teach teachers about the world teachers teach teachers .
yes , books that maybe are sold 100 or 1,000 per year in the year .
it doesn &apos;t surprise everybody like , isn &apos;t it ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so that &apos;s not very hard .
the days of the most popular , if people say , &quot; well , we &apos;d like to have three or a more targeted of this in our country to see how this works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a rocket system . it &apos;s a education project .
you can use a couple of thousands of children with two more skilled .
so it &apos;s like a electronic book .
everybody says that &apos;s a $ 100 laptop , you can &apos;t do it .
and that &apos;s the launch .
you click around things and stare at screens . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no . there &apos;s a better way . &quot;
we &apos;re all playing &quot; i love lucy &quot; on a big line of information , and we can &apos;t keep out of information .
thank you .
i think most people think that a pregnant mother , whatever her child is .
that &apos;s not possible . it &apos;s not going .
it &apos;s going to be all good . you &apos;ll live .
first , the most popular thing to prevent .
two years ago , one of the mentor mothers came to me and told me a story .
how do you build a better health system ?
the key thing is , how simple the system is .
if you look at the volume of the gray substance in age four to 22 years , it takes the time to see what this graph is . it &apos;s the early youth in the early youth .
the idea that your father was singing in the public , she passed out to be a lot of the time .
this is the most popular thing we built together .
after the first year , it was invited by the irs falcon museum in austria to install it in his lobby and i &apos;m happy to say that there was a day online , 24 hours a day .
but in the night , when we were looking at the tele-actor , i asked the tele-actor , how would the police landscape have decided that they would kiss sam donaldson .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place where my family has been working on the u.s. for four generations .
honestly , i don &apos;t know what it has with idiots , but they &apos;re incredibly skilled .
the first thing you see in the most violent is the terrible force of the animal &apos;s .
he &apos;s standing on my leg , picks me up , bring me up to a vehicle and can bring me to a doctor .
it was a depression in the ground .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about them . &quot;
we have calculated that 200 years of our direct life is the end of our direct life .
it &apos;s so simple , technology as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect , like technology .
it &apos;s the most powerful of my favorite .
i &apos;d like to think -- thank you .
and i can assure you : corn is all sorts of things .
you should know that in every community the number of people who are already growing up is clearly more clear .
i led three main pieces of antarctica .
but i said , where you &apos;re lying and what country you belong to . &quot;
we also explored the surface of the islands -- a very important , very important , very important for birds , one of the most important things in the pacific .
and we &apos;re the rest of the world , a problem .
he coined the term &quot; reverse fishing license . &quot;
of course , the most popular and open lake was the open sea , but the most successful sea , which everybody likes to look at , was in trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific , with huge amounts of plastic and huge giant .
now there are a lot of the world &apos;s immediate , immediate , automatic , automatic , for many of our devices , even on the smartphones .
it &apos;s an endless debate and there &apos;s no conclusions , no only answer to it , but if you &apos;re a giant geek like me , you say , &quot; well , what are the data going to tell us ? &quot;
instead , he &apos;s very carefully documented what happens again when technology is first in a environment and in a community .
so there &apos;s , of course , two different ways .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a yves &apos;s painting .
i mean , it was at least , like i did happy .
now , there was a question that i was looking at for a while in a head , well , can i do more of the things that i like to do in design , and less of those who i don &apos;t like to do ?
and here it is from the front .
they &apos;re a terrible situation without the road .
they &apos;re going to be flooded with hospitals .
as a 15-year-old , for example , i was considered as incredibly gifted in the street , because i knew the most extraordinary , and i know how to use the design , and i can work quickly with the most salient .
i &apos;ve seen this value of older people in my 20s , and &apos; 70s , &apos; 80s , &apos; 80s , and &apos; 90s , and &apos; 90s , and the &apos; 90s , they still are active than a hundred thousand farmers and doctors .
as christian , and made out of a maker of the steel , and made a young woman , young jewish men in the united states and canada , and superman , who also went back to the bible .
the case of the world &apos;s most muslim , the last muslim .
the biggest bad man , not , don &apos;t want these rocks to be the same . so he &apos;s trying to stop it at the bottom of the day .
and one of my favorites is anchor from yemen .
&quot; and , when does the article come out ? &quot;
so , the question is , it has to give something that we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; &#93; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous when a group of themselves identified themselves as extremely .
and the instructor &apos;s s : islam &apos;s excited .
let &apos;s look at it .
let me highlight it for you .
let me show you this .
and when i started designing , i discovered something curious about myself .
so they have the eye and then they come to the concepts .
but of course china has a tremendous population .
but what that shows is that this kind of visualization is a form of information , which is a form of information .
it &apos;s even a pleasure to engage with you , because you &apos;re visual .
the most powerful is named after the eden project in britain .
why doesn &apos;t it smell like potato or a more unfair ? so there are two theories .
and a theory allows a less to work .
now after a few months of searching , i discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule that you call a little bit of a time called a little bit of a convenience .
this is the basis of the device that these two people built in ford .
they made it -- and it &apos;s got to smell like coumarin .
that was a good thing .
now , at the time , a series of things are going on to me , which i want to pay you attention to .
and she actually didn &apos;t have a clue of the context that she landed .
norman !
i didn &apos;t say goodbye goodbye , neither my mother , my father , my sister , my brother , my brother , my father , my cousins , my grandparents , my grandparents , no .
i reports . i &apos;m telling you , just to say that i had two things when i left the orphanage that i wanted to do . this one was , my family , and the other , poetry .
and this is how we look for them .
and then you hope that one of us are running around and little bits of pieces .
he had a computer company , and he has to be careful from others , female and probably smaller family family , to reach his age of 12 .
is this a good evolutionary adaptation or will it lead to the villagers that are the very pristine way on earth ?
but will we do that or will we take nature through their run ?
one day , a few weeks or maybe a year later , i was with my favorite school in a store for a national school company , and i wanted to buy a little bit of the war .
that meant a fundamental change for me .
my hint : about 70 layers of this , take a lot of the time .
you know , how obsessed with me is that i &apos;m really , this project is just for me , and yet i went so far , i &apos;m going to buy a chinese newspaper from the back of the city to buy the bird with a reasonable twist to
when we go to the way to the creative blue mountains in the west of sydney , it was a perfect computer project : sun , the smell of the brain , and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you &apos;re ever going to walk again , just with a plastic . &quot;
i remember my father put me out in the wheelchair , and i was stuck up from the top to the bottom , and i felt the sun &apos;s first time .
they told me , &quot; we &apos;ll put you next to you because we think that &apos;s good for you . &quot;
she passed me up the phone , and i called the school school , i was going to go and say i wanted to give a little bit of a ride .
and i said , &quot; well , &quot; aw . &quot;
and mom and dad ? were never up .
i &apos;m in this world , but i work in the noisy .
it &apos;s like a computer jet of a richard serra , flying through a richard serra .
how hell should i do a telephone in three weeks when i &apos;ve developed these things about millions of years ?
each of these elements could be covered in the wall as a kind of object .
in his days , he was the highest ruler in british .
i look at individual science , and as you flow -- how you stretch and flow , it &apos;s based on furniture , but it &apos;s not the most powerful . it &apos;s been made by aluminum , as opposed to aluminum and it &apos;s grown .
this is the car of the future . it &apos;s a helicopter .
if you ask it to be contemporary architecture , it feels completely of natural .
this is my studio . it &apos;s underground .
it was made from kevlar .
and i had the very best time to do my dr. , i was fortunate to be a member of a computer company that was used for the first time to explore the ocean .
there was one of these most popular .
he uses red bioluminescence like a plastic system to get a plastic tag to get animals to get the red light blind and can see them without being seen .
so they use it to find them and to find partners .
i urge you to call a different science , which is still used hundreds of years old technology .
this is a magical place .
so i made a look at the value of sleep .
and on june fifth , i heard a loud bang on the glass that changed my life and ended up with a duck .
and here &apos;s the duck again .
after the price , my life changed .
another example of the impact of the brain impact on the life of birds .
so , if i do something like this -- this is the sound for purple .
the way i &apos;m going to do it , i can hear music with the food and write .
one of them is &quot; i have a dream of martin luther king , and the other is hitler .
now , you can see more often , that former pioneer is the most popular thing .
you don &apos;t want to say anything about it , which could be used against a . &quot;
absolutely critical .
and what happens when teachers want to get order ?
and why not ? you don &apos;t trust the law . why don &apos;t you trust the law ?
because it &apos;s that freedom has a structure of a structure .
because life is complex . and here &apos;s the hardest , and the biggest change : we need to have the authority for the interpretation and using the law of law and the officer .
a free society needs red and green lights , otherwise it will be a very pervasive person .
it &apos;s going to take boundaries for the interest that can compute the most powerful and for the transplant that you can take .
well , if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard to get the columns to a ruler .
he had a very bad job .
he had just a single one of the things .
but the problem , on rules and incentives , is that they &apos;re cheating , and they practiced the professional activity , and they &apos;re starving in the two ways .
so smart folk engineers are better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that any smart dna rate can get upright time for unlimited time .
why has this idea spread ?
people want to be more adept .
it was a remarkable time . i &apos;m going to play the mentality of a little bit more deeply , which we -- america and the rest of the world -- in the back of the world .
this was a little bit of a second , the turtle .
we have to do this with a complete kind of carbon system .
what i want to show you is what you need to get in the wild , to get 72 pounds up to the ones that you would have to get in the wild .
what would have been if you had nuclear weapons ?
we come down and we bring trucks to the top of them , and they &apos;re going to see somewhere here .
part of the problem is that the most important self is , you know , the idea of a nuclear disaster .
it was sent to me from somebody who &apos;s a computer company who &apos;s a computer company , and it &apos;s the fact that america had hard .
there are many black sheep out there that are doing the wrong things , and the problems have even swum .
we can show our results . we can make things better .
how can we tap them up ?
it &apos;s a very dangerous working environment to have a dangerous working environment .
imagine , we could , because if we could , we could do more .
governments who are doing most of the progress are the governments who have found ways to make shared value in business , rather shared value , instead of seeing the government that has the battle .
maybe i can cut this up , look at the brain , and i can change my cut .
i want to zoom in .
come on with me a moment with me , in the 19th century , in a very short , of course .
we might certainly be so productive if facebook or twitter wouldn &apos;t cost us so much time .
they look at the british government , to get money for building babbage &apos;s machines , because they believed that these machines were very practical , very practical effects for society .
these benefits didn &apos;t just enable less wealthy men to research , but they also upset them about the most popular , rather than answering just questions .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i learned something about life .
once you start looking at the very little stuff -- this person wrote a whole article , and said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and all of those not old enough , they have no idea how these infection happened -- which is through this episode .
there are about 10,000 programs .
this would be the frequency of the being 26 letters of the unfortunate , in one of the random elected monkeys in one of the random elected apes .
wherever life is , you will have these distribution , unlike this distribution .
too hot , too hot .
the officer asks , &quot; are you sure ? hey , you &apos;re sure you &apos;ve lost that one ? &quot;
these are the data of a single survey to the most successful survey in zambia , from a few years ago , where i have a few years ago .
as you see , bruce willis at the time was much more hair .
you could talk about 10,000 , 20,000 or 30,000 dollars if i had the time , and i didn &apos;t just have the vacation .
instead of teaching people how to put forms on the cell phones , we should develop software that allows them to do the self without exercise and without my favorite .
this is less than i did at the time , when i went to a couple of weeks as a consultant .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , in life or in the balloon , we have to change the height .
this can be in spirituality .
and that &apos;s why you need weather rights .
i promised that i was going to take the next time i would fly around the world , no fuel , regardless of fossil fuels , to be sure to be safe , not being threatened by the most inclusive .
i think you need a pilot in the airplane to talk to the universities that can talk to students , with politicians during the flight , and it can really make a human adventure .
and what &apos;s the goal ?
this is why all people who believe in this spirit is welcome to being part of this team .
now you just need one laptop .
anyway , for us , africa was a magical place .
the next thing i want to make clarity is , what this problem is and what it is not .
that &apos;s crazy , really , if you think about it .
let &apos;s stop with a second with a nonsense .
the fact is that we can see the first generation , and this extreme poverty can see the eyes , say , and tell them , and it &apos;s to do it . we don &apos;t have to stand .
it &apos;s a nerves .
this year is a test for us , especially for the leaders of the g8 states , which are starting to see the world .
people are getting out of it .
and with this one campaign as our chute , my organization , data , and other groups that the energy and the enthusiasm of the outside of hollywood to the north of america is occupied by the north of america .
: step for step forward , a nurse , a teacher , a friend , and life is saved .
the idea that the internet , which has all of their lives changed , can change a country -- and a continent of it just made to analog , let me go out to digital -- i put the head .
lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
now , their job is to recognize what this shapes is , and which is kiki .
now , if you &apos;re not just a little bit more reflective , this sentence , literally , is just wrong .
if we solve a problem or something new , we compare what we already know , with what &apos;s unknown to us .
nadia thwaites : i &apos;m happy to be here .
they don &apos;t even fit into all these projections .
pm : i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what i do .
how do you handle it , personally , but with your favorite relationship ?
some of my reporters have been arrested .
so , clearly , this shows a different picture of yemen .
my heart was three times big .
this is a list of side effects : if you eat too much salt like a car , like a traffic , and you probably land on the intensive care system .
but soon i showed symptoms for the computer , and i had to go back to the white , knowing that i probably never would see my home again .
i was sitting there , and i talked little little bit about the computer bank for the user channel and asked him what i needed when i needed a transplant , could to prepare me .
i was on a dozen machines that kept me alive .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these is also one of these most popular things in the united states , and in the united states , there was 200 percent .
also , interesting business is that the same business that makes us the 80 million pounds of atrazine , the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; -- now sold the antidote -- a and the same company .
we also launched as a result of a team .
what would our children say to us , if they &apos;re a day of child every day , i had a little bit of a little bit more flexible , some artificial , some kind of mimic a.
the problem is that in my village , oakland , in most of our villages , that connection is not seeing .
here &apos;s the accumulation of the theme document next to the airport of los angeles .
i offered five cents for every single time .
the most powerful can &apos;t be contained , it &apos;s become global .
here you see , in red , the spread of the internet .
they &apos;re like a mouse watching the foot of an elephant , and the largest part of them remain hidden .
they look out of their bodies and they come from all directions around us .
redwoods have a huge surface that &apos;s expanding in the sky because they tend to be what &apos;s called the most profitable -- repetition .
the redwood tree is giving the redwood center of stability , just like a cathedral , and help live , to live longer .
it &apos;s absolutely valid , which is to see .
but for recently , all the doors of the palace are ripped open and break the walls .
this was 25 years ago .
so let &apos;s first look at the first time the world &apos;s office .
how do these people do with these infected computers ?
and you can afford to watch how we work -- how security power work -- and try to find a way to find the most powerful , the most powerful we meet .
you &apos;ll notice that you can see there at the bottom , and you can see , the one is a d , d / d , and if you open this image file on your computer , this program is downloaded and picked up .
and if you look at the pictures of the scene , you can see that the kind of the gorilla is the kind of the settlement .
we need to find any way to make sure that everything is playing , even though the computer is falling .
but i don &apos;t have anything to do with that .
this person is around with consultants .
why should we believe what he says ? &quot;
what &apos;s his future ?
these forces completely disappear , no one &apos;s going to go through the 2011 .
it would be good if people were more pragmatic , and they &apos;re taking these kinds of calculations and they would participate , because this would change things . but it would change things on two types of things .
that means that we can see a copy of ourselves , if you just use one piece of the most powerful , and it &apos;s going to be a worse , and a worse , and a more powerful thing , and a more powerful thing .
and the happy few , jill and kevin ? well , they came back from their favorite , and saw that their video was suddenly spreading as a baby machine .
thank you !
you &apos;re going to go to the distance .
this is what he taught to do , since he was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had a mentor like mau , who taught me how to dedicate .
what &apos;s it about you today ? not 10 years ago .
what do you do with what you &apos;re doing and you do it ?
didn &apos;t have the -- time . didn &apos;t have the -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right manager . didn &apos;t ...
in this moment , aware or unconscious . right now , in the moment you decide to focus on something , you can make a meaning , and whatever it means , it makes emotion .
have you ever done what , and then you go , &quot; that was me ! &quot;
to death , so , god in his infinite wisdom , gave us another human need : the uncertainty .
but this is true : we need it . we can do it through intimacy , through friendship , through prayers , through the movement in nature .
and there are seven different beliefs . i can &apos;t go through it , because i &apos;m through . the last element is feeling .
jewish man with family in occupied territory , someone in new york , who died if he had been in work , and this man who wanted to be a terrorist and it was very clear .
instead , i &apos;m interested in developing tools with which one big number of people can tell their stories all over the world .
the color of the particles is the kind of feeling of feeling -- happy , positive colors have shining colors .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was the whole day on the computer . &quot;
and when i go over here , the list starts walking , and there are thousands of feelings that were collected .
the ten themes of rays and circle of time is the time period .
it &apos;s called &quot; universe : unveiling of our modern mythology . &quot;
we can click that and see this iconic image of betty ford , like her husband &apos;s coffin .
you can also look at quotes if you want to read quotes to climate change .
so people feel like something that is in ways .
in life , they called tens of thousands of members of the world today in 100 countries .
they just need one step out to go outside , and that &apos;s what they usually do , so that &apos;s so banal , so so so banal , that all other people are missing .
so look up , admire the positive beauty , and think of it always to wear the head in the clouds .
that would have been thrown up 25,000 recordings that would have made this : &quot; well , good , good .
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the most popular , to buy my first ted team . it was a huge machine .
this footage came from a virtual autopsy .
here you can see the knife being hacked in the heart .
it &apos;s a little , mechanical pen , which has built in its inner inner motors .
this is a really interesting project now .
so he does .
so , very talented people .
i went to the kids as often as possible to get the academic stuff out with the real world in connection .
it &apos;s not all , but it &apos;s an incredibly empowering summary of everything we know about nature .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details , why we think the universe is so much , but it &apos;s going to be the mathematics and trying to explain physics that we know .
in my career , i found something in my career , but it &apos;s always happening in me .
in 2001 , i visited them during a prison shop .
we got a lot of jobs .
this is the one that &apos;s the first degree in 2004 .
he &apos;s just standing in front of the ted bank and was recently filmed with somebody you know .
each one becomes a soundscape , but in different scientific disciplines , it &apos;s specialized .
i have my first computer as a teenager in accra , and it was a really great device .
he &apos;s exploring the brain using mri and he says that this is the most beautiful brain he ever made .
so the next few slides i &apos;m going to explain to you about this .
transistors are going to be smaller to allow us to do that and have a lot better done .
our main system is behind this lens .
i had a gut feeling that we &apos;re wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so we know what a schwarzschild radius is .
i like to call you the most powerful of the design of the computer , because they &apos;re kind of kind of a little bit more nuanced .
we can see more detail in our galaxy than somewhere else .
and that &apos;s what makes us a factor of 20 .
so there was a bunch of alternatives to the notion that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could put a lot of stuff there .
it &apos;s a lot more powerful than the other and the cloud is taken apart .
and i hope i &apos;ve actually convinced you that we have a really supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy .
one day i was on the streets new york , and i saw some kids playing between stairs , cars and fire .
so for example , people in the 11th of the 11th liked pieces that have been so announced .
in the first eight centuries of this tradition , the great &quot; what &quot; in the world , to appreciate god and to prices .
by new and improved instruments , the age of the infamous thing broke .
but one question is : what happens when the music stops ?
michael paravicini thomas : music and feelings over time
so we &apos;re at the beginning of a new computer system .
until 1945 , they took it on 100,000 every year .
so i &apos;m going to talk about a lot of the time , although i don &apos;t know where to start .
wow , a volunteer , great !
but recently , my interest was to look at a new array of a new array of views , because there are things that can really make this cool .
well , i think this is the latest development of a phenomenon that we call self-assembly innovation .
but the subject of desire is really the most important .
we get a fabulous talk from them .
let me introduce you to sam &apos;s .
but even if you &apos;re going to go to the screen , there &apos;s a lot more than words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
as global innovation is emerging .
one : i have to show a service to the audience , and from the talk , what i &apos;m going to give him , instead of saying what i &apos;m not going to offer .
and that they &apos;re fun to design their own ultimate or honest tedtalk .
well , you can &apos;t compare them to each other .
they hold them alive and give them the sugar , such a kind of a kind of kind of a kind of plastic that we call the superpower .
so this kind of testing is going to be that , ok ?
somebody asked , &quot; why ? &quot;
and he thought he could reverse the waves . couldn &apos;t it .
i think there are three big changes , and it &apos;s in the areas transparency , choice and accountability , where people have a real power .
how do we do that ?
my favorite , sharon , and he said , all over the world exists more photos of her mind as any other one .
11 of 14 countries .
and secondly , teachers were looking at the most popular and the way that they can predict the resources , because they were taking a specific position of the environment , which is a more useful sense of a water .
so i wish everyone a beautiful weekend .
and to read dna and write , it &apos;s always easier and cheaper .
angeline work alone .
now , you might ask yourself , &quot; what would i do in a museum ? &quot;
if you have all the world &apos;s world , this is a kind of a computer service , which allows to be a biotechnology , which is allowing to do biotechnology .
the kingdom of the kingdom is allowing him to allow the laws of strangers or a professional risk , or a health care or a risk of health or the values of the state .
these laws are a blow into the face for science and is based on prejudice and ignorance and a sustainable of the traditions and a selective diagnostic system .
why are you going to be pregnant when you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of the 10 new investment users are affecting drugs .
so that social scientists that are transmitted condoms are not being tracked by endangered food providers , not even by the police , called , &quot; randomly locked up . &quot;
here were children born , people died there .
office for personal work are already obsolete .
they have gone out the high line , the road , the river below the street , and you get from one end to the other , without crossing the most , without crossing the most , without crossing the street .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny apartments . &quot;
also jobs should be shared .
their liver is able to make oil .
and they killed around the 12,000 sharks at the time , by actually sitting in a single fashion of the world &apos;s most violent bay bay island .
we know very little about them .
so this tag finds the place of a shark , depending on the time and the sunset , the water and depth .
let &apos;s look at the throughput , which has to be passed to the genes that are passed from the parents , then we see basking sharks compared to the first study , a factor of 10 times more diverse than others .
so , in the way , of that research , of the research , and found that the size of the 9,000 is the size .
and what was fine . we got wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build it . &quot;
so if we can tell the gender of the shark , before we take a sample , we can say if you were a male or female .
so i decided to give myself the caregiver .
your body will cut up with a body &apos;s body , and it &apos;s meant to be used for any more appropriate to make money -- people tell themselves a lot of these stories .
no business with no one .
my journalism may not fit in other continents or in other countries , but in my part of africa , it &apos;s working on the world , and it &apos;s about corruption , asking people , &quot; where are the evidence ?
aa thank you .
i was raised in downtown manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks away from the north coast of the world &apos;s apartment .
i wouldn &apos;t read as a magic designer .
and had these people ever recognized a victim of their own brain ?
today , you can be fired in 29 states , in more than half of the country , because of its sexuality .
at some point i realized that my mission &quot; gay &quot; was to be turned into a , because there was a million different types of gay technology .
at least i hope it &apos;s harder to get your human rights .
first , the world is , and it &apos;s always going to contain good and evil , because good and bad , yin and yang are the most prolific .
and third , i had access to all 1,000 pictures that were the soldiers .
in three ways , the conventional way is called the overall .
this is stanley tarter , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he asked himself , &quot; could the holocaust happen here , here and now ? &quot;
&quot; my lord , who is responsible if he &apos;s going to happen ? &quot;
stanley tarter and i actually closed both of the high school , the james school , at the the bronx .
here &apos;s the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
the other thing . the self &apos;s self .
alexander &apos;s name says that the border between good and evil through the heart of any human .
and i put the experiment on the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what everyone could do , &quot; no big thing to jump on .
it &apos;s a mystery that really was very difficult to do .
we have a self .
but on my left retina , a computer &apos;s brain is a computer that &apos;s a little bit of the red arrow .
there &apos;s only one reference reference , which is the body .
i promise i don &apos;t say anything to it except that it should be scary .
and the autobiographical self has extended memories , think of imagination and language .
thank you . thank you for the duck -- and paypal hill .
now i &apos;m telling you this -- i &apos;m telling you , and i &apos;m just making it ridiculous , because i think feminism has partly the task , admit , the aesthetics , and beauty and fun .
we don &apos;t want a heroine .
now , you can see , i didn &apos;t put myself in fire .
she talked about the news of the , she was running , she was organized , she organized her friends , she &apos;s doing all these everyday activities of caring and creativity .
i mean that this is the conscious issue that the homo sapiens of former former the former .
in fact , this sensor is a sensor that reads the electric activity in my brain while i &apos;m holding this talk .
we &apos;re a lot of prototypes and products that you can control with thoughts , like thought-controlled appliances , or a floating chair .
the headset is associated with a ipad or a smartphone .
how these kids can use their new consciousness to their recovery , many of the harmful and more powerful social media projects are going to turn to see people as different , to see themselves .
they understood the power of human narrative and that the value we &apos;re doing in humans change , changing , and growing .
and said , &quot; how are you going to celebrate ? &quot;
my skills and my possibilities .
and so , temporary , they gave up .
this is a specialist that was not holding my eyes to look at my eyes .
i went to a track that i know .
and very , very slowly , it happened .
i didn &apos;t really believe in my own , not really , not all of the characteristics of me , all the little prior to all of us .
that &apos;s me . my whole thing .
what we have is exactly the same thing , the same activity , but in one of them , they feel great , and in the other , with only one small change in the posture , they feel terrible .
but i think it &apos;s a different debate that needs to take place to the extent of control , which we have about our tax tax .
for the way , for the energy of the money , you could have put in the trains , which didn &apos;t have reduced the duration of the journey , but what the pleasure and the utility and the utility would have improved more .
i &apos;m not asking for the complete priority of one over the other .
sometimes lines are very , very long .
i think the danger in the world today is that the field of economics is understood as a human psychology to human psychology .
the average answer to 50 to 60 percent is being kept .
it &apos;s going to be you , you know , that you &apos;re not going to be yourself , other hurt .
yay !
they &apos;re 20 , 30 years back .
but that didn &apos;t mean that i have a coin with a head of head .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but this is our skin of the visible universe .
thank you .
with hyperscore , we had enough concepts in the world , really strong effects in children around the world , and now in humans every age .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful , that wants to live forever .
hi . my name is dan &apos;s , i &apos;m 34 years old , and i have cerebral gases .
this is actually the score of dan &apos;s show , which he &apos;s completely composed in hyperscore .
odysseus said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do a nuclear record .
there &apos;s one of the present self .
i have to write five pages a day for article , or i had to give five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that today , it &apos;s going to work . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you is the last time that i &apos;ve done with hal &apos;s time , which i &apos;ve been doing with hal , who was introduced to me from my co-author in a previous project bill sharpe .
it &apos;s pretty good that it &apos;s not about the people affected , because if one of the faces smile , the other face is going to look at the same face .
this is one of the reasons that so much of what we think of western science , math and engineering , actually , in the first few centuries of our evolutionary budget , has been developed by the most successful , more powerful and more responsible .
x is the unknown , because there &apos;s no sh .
so it &apos;s not that if you &apos;re talking about these of mental illness , you probably have stories of the most profitable , shame and discrimination in almost all the lifetime of life .
something more than 30 years ago , the nations were formed in the world in the world in northern africa and gave these legendary explanation .
what is it about ?
if you look at the level of species , you &apos;ve heard about fish .
you look at this profit , you see that nearly 8,000 of these dollars are actually subsidies .
this was in the early pajamas , when india was driving his head of life -- as a way to go to the public -- for the recovery of the day , to china , 10 , nine , 10 percent looked and asked himself , why can &apos;t we
it puts them in no happy position , but they have trust and the courage , and the courage to say , &quot; we &apos;ve calculated .
green carbon , so the emissions through deforestation and agriculture , and blue carbon together are 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it .
i didn &apos;t know what these things mean , dick doesn &apos;t mean -- sydney by the way .
i also liked these intellectual folk artists .
and he said he had essentially had the same relationship to his father .
there was a theory .
he did it in 1968 .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t move in the course of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed the whole thing , and the color color , which is hidden that just fantastic shell .
many of these ideas are produced in the trailer for airstream .
if you think about it , your children to send the tinkering school , you will come back with a plastic company , and you &apos;ll go back to the ground .
but let &apos;s play it under your own conditions and trust me , you &apos;ll learn things that you can &apos;t learn from the most cosmopolitan .
if you want to throw out a device next to you , don &apos;t do it .
i think that &apos;s all . that &apos;s five . okay .
so here you see the sick knee on the left , and here my wife now , at the walk today , four months after , in aspen , and in good constitution .
how about a completely valid street , not just the sharing ?
this is one of the seven times more existing , which was not been shot in all of the time .
and so , in the years of bhutan , western europe started to buy western europe , and then thousands , hundreds and hundreds of millions of individual , and then print millions of individual , little paper sheets that should bring one out of hell in the sky .
but how does our imagination work ?
but we never think about the hidden connections .
as edison invented the light bulb , she saw about this .
you have to be right , and even though i don &apos;t have college college , that doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m stupid , because you can &apos;t be stupid today , and it &apos;s going to bring it in the world .
they literally have the door to get us off .
if you listen to the most threatening to your favorite , both ears both hear the speaker .
we have the problem that the antenna is filling up .
thank you very much .
and i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and the most responsible .
recently , i created some pretty sophisticated folk projects made from the dravidian bully .
and i drew her own special card , and she wrote her name , she and she was dancing and sent them .
i &apos;m sure i can see how you &apos;re going to be a lot of the time .
and i &apos;m convinced that it &apos;s a lot of the time , my valuable and limited life in this earth just so much more easily .
in this mode , he tries to keep its position .
i thought i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about how nature creates materials .
next to the future , we think about future technologies , we start at the beginning of the world .
and if you look at it , you see the amino acids with the plastic sensors that you have different charges .
and by a series of a series of a series of a series of a billion fish , you can go from one billion fish that do what you want to grow , like a battery or a solar cell .
in this case , you can see the water .
if you ask people the question , where do you go , if you have something important ?
i sat on my desk , and i &apos;ve used my expensive computer .
what happens -- sometimes you have these days , you wake up by eight o &apos;clock in the morning , or at seven or when you &apos;re standing up , and you say , &quot; man , i don &apos;t have good sleep .
in the office , most of these are interruptions and distractions that people are actually holding from work , execution .
we all know that this is true . they would never experience a spontaneous meeting that employees will be done .
so meetings and managers are now the two main problems in companies , especially in offices .
maybe every two weeks , or every week , once the week , the one that nobody can talk to .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m doing this now seven years and i have no idea how the future will be .
but if you ask people to go to the three important things they carry on , whatever culture and what the relationship -- most people , the other people , and what the relationship -- the key , and if they have one , the mobile phone .
but , and this is a very big but , we have the tendency to forget .
well , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
they take 10 or 20 percent of the world &apos;s license and then -- the owner of the seat takes 10 or 20 percent , and there &apos;s the rest of the amount in the bar on my family .
it challenges the norm .
and he kind of has a recognition of the values of rotating .
at the same time , with these mobile devices , we see a expectation of availability .
our current reality is less interesting than the history we &apos;re going to tell later about .
what are we talking about ?
dean ornish shares new research projects that show how the subjects can affect healthy lifestyles , and it tells you that , if we live healthier , it says , if we live healthier , exercise and more love , our brain cells actually raise up .
until i tell you who &apos;s told .
within this context , we can obviously feel regret about many different things .
when i went home after the night , after i got my tattoo , i stayed almost the whole night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s another fifth .
i mean , even the dumb &quot; answer &quot; to all of us , let &apos;s go back to a day-to-day period .
and as i said , i &apos;m a computer company .
i thought i &apos;d try to convince my ted wish to try to understand what i &apos;m trying to do , and how to do that , what they &apos;re trying to do .
no in india . now there &apos;s at least half a million active active .
and i came to think that someone in this whole whole world has to think about the organization of the world &apos;s organization .
and so we made that to do that .
listen , you &apos;re going to say , less than four , one percent of whom were treated , the practice of their drugs , or even the time of their drugs , or even in the way they have their treatment .
it &apos;s a try and i think it would be successful .
the desks are not dozens .
if the fallacy is used , it will generate 8,000 watts of electricity . day and night .
and people bring their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , with green school .
the other women from bali cook on the food and they use secrets that know only their grandmothers .
we need somebody who comes and studied it .
the green school is a model that we built for the world .
my tongue , voice and vocal vocal , were still healthy and not dead . &quot;
then apple got out of the best voice i &apos;ve heard .
there was a reason for that : that was me .
the main problem is not of course .
but that &apos;s not what it is .
initially , the internet was a computer tool , and now it &apos;s something that i &apos;m going to leave for my real life , everyday life .
it &apos;s human being able to ignore disease .
they all know the test for artificial intelligence , the turing test .
before i was an architect , and my grandmother asked me , &quot; what are you alive ? &quot;
we treated two main pages as a single side , because it &apos;s the one that &apos;s true .
so what is the lesson behind ?
one day , my grandmother said , &quot; no , this time you walk around .
it &apos;s been happening and terrible things happened with me .
all of the hope in my healing .
so they went to their own , and they collected their rubber furniture -- they gave me pots and steel , and they were doing a wall , and they were all .
you don &apos;t know how far away this street is , and you don &apos;t know if you go straight and hear cars and you hear cars , and they had a terrible accident that they had to do in this situation .
i thought that for some reason , the time was left and only had to stop for family and friends .
for example , the molecular structure .
he took me to the most popular of the street .
can we say we &apos;ve all discovered symmetries of the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t turn it up because i &apos;ve built a little barrier , right ?
if i rotate a magic match , and then one more , it makes a third .
galois set up a series of laws for how these tables , these symmetries , interact .
so , one such symmetry we call it .
instead of all the mess , i want to know how many digits have the number . ok ?
i need your last name . symmetrical objects have basically -- please spell it for me .
first , worse nutrition , maybe shorter , more likely .
thomas edison had a building in software in a software machine today .
penicillin was discovered in 1926 , but even in 1940 , there were no commercial amounts of useful and medical effort .
it was the origin of the design of the day , the last year his 50th birthday .
for me , the lesson of unintended consequences is that chaos is happening now . let &apos;s do the best thing .
it works in every computer and browser , minus , minus , minus , and the text will be smaller .
they don &apos;t need to delete any extra .
and so a kind of information that i &apos;m inspired is that i &apos;m going to make my real desk .
a means that it was a kind of a mass of a life , so you get the more traditional desktop , and the things are in grid .
now i get to my music , and there &apos;s no other boundaries of people , and there &apos;s no boundaries .
but i think the point is , it &apos;s metaphor with bite , and with such a bite i want to suggest that we &apos;re going to rethink the role of contemporary math a little bit , not just just the only thing that we &apos;re doing , but math
and he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s 2,000 physicists today on wall street and i &apos;m one of them . &quot;
you can find them here : this is a book about flies , which may have you on amazon .
these are not a lot of the time ; that &apos;s culture .
you can do it very , very far .
and it &apos;s not the money that actually is so interesting .
go . shake . louder !
i want to tell you a secret .
so , intersections without traffic lights , so with stop signs , save many lives , but there &apos;s a excessive amount of money .
the answer is to allow cars to come from this side of the street .
warren buffet had recommend this : honestly to say what works and make it not and to make a annual cause .
in fact , we see the genetic code that it &apos;s the only known disease because of the living in africa , and actually have a lot of things that have been formed to avoid the most important thing .
this means that the economy is sweeping in these areas , because it &apos;s just so much inevitable .
but that &apos;s not a single story of us .
not only was she weak ; she &apos;s got weaker .
a teacher of the upper neighborhood will be measured the performance of his class -- measured in a year for 10 percent .
but it &apos;s not in any relationship to being a better teacher .
&quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
and these free courses could not only be available in the internet , but you can also make dvds everywhere , so everyone with access to access to a drug culture can have the best teachers .
traditional vessels , like this cup , need eight to 10 hours to burn .
the sculptor richard serra talks about how he thought as a young artist , he was a painter and he lived after his high school school .
when i look home , i &apos;m looking at the smoke , and i went back to my clothes when i went home at night .
my parents were responding . they said , &quot; we know you &apos;re afraid , but let &apos;s just go tomorrow .
but is it so bad to keep us for such powerful ?
this is a lot of general in boston .
the pavilion takes the sample , it &apos;s a , it &apos;s a , it &apos;s a , looking at it , looking at it under the microscope and then the operating room .
so in this process , a solution to these supernormal molecules , with a dye , is shown in a green , and here &apos;s a patient &apos;s green , and it can &apos;t separate the molecules in the front of a patient &apos;s patient .
with a drug node , as part of our current version of our current today , the surgeon &apos;s surgeon , the lymph node , where the cancer begins .
if nerves are damaged , they can cause paralysis , and pain .
if we &apos;re two samples of these two samples ...
we know that &apos;s doable and we &apos;re determined to realize this .
and this cell is one of the thousands of different types of energy that we learn .
it &apos;s going to affect the healthy circuits as well as the sick you want to fix .
and one morning in summer , we tried it and it &apos;s been done in the first time .
we &apos;ve shown that already a short index of this cells is enough to make the learning .
and it &apos;s going on . now .
i want to end with a story that we think might be clinical application .
now you can see that the animal actually flows out the walls and the little platform can use and use its eyes again .
buildings are neighboring with the air , and they &apos;re in the air , and they &apos;re in the air , and on mechanical engineering .
and if you stay out of nowhere , the air contains microbes that are associated with the absence of water and air .
obviously , i &apos;m a physical person , as you see , so i had no worry , that thing has gone down 20 blocks .
the same thing for the question is , who after 9 / 11 was the streets of the streets in my neighborhood ?
and you can get a list .
one of these things i &apos;ve been experimenting with is something called google sharing , basically you can take a abstract term and look at google , and then you look at this data in the data of someone .
this is a mess spears . i mean , ok .
if you have the second side here , most of the things .
what was normal for us 40 years ago -- the stories between generations -- is now rarely .
in 1939 , the film is older than most of our members of our members .
was the story good to tell ?
why don &apos;t we see that with the same passion as reading ?
in california , they &apos;re going to send up with a bribe : &quot; this product contains chemicals that are from the state of california as a single state of cancer as a single country , and the other thing . &quot;
so maybe we could develop a more powerful , which requires humility , and for my profession as an architect , it &apos;s a bad thing that words are &quot; humility &quot; and &quot; architect &quot; -- &quot; the eternal source &quot; and &quot; the eternal source &quot; .
i don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was : &quot; the stone stone didn &apos;t end because we &apos;re going through the stones . &quot;
and it can be very well for berlin , but we did it in houston , and all the windows is closed . and with all the products that obviously aren &apos;t designed for using use in increasing , that &apos;s actually a vertical of a light range .
if we look at the word competition , i &apos;m sure most of you use it .
since we &apos;ve been taking the 4,000 at the most common , most common , in a database that we &apos;re going to provide in six weeks of the public .
now we have 160 kilos of heavy primes the internet &apos;s internet .
we started using commercial and mixed using buildings so that all people in centers and places have come to be where they can stop .
and this is the most powerful thing in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . let &apos;s tell you none of the people that we knew that all of us knew that because we didn &apos;t know .
for example , they start to say that the most popular things in microsoft started at 9 / 11 , at yahoo at the 12th march , at the 12th march , and then the other one : google , facebook , skype and so on .
i chose sweden because sweden was similar laws , like the united states .
and whatever you tell them , he didn &apos;t have to hide about it just a long time .
their email were read , and she talked to the most in the prison and said , &quot; if there &apos;s no right to privacy , there can &apos;t be any mental freedom , and therefore no effective democracy can be . &quot;
many people , if you see a fresh human brain , say , &quot; usually it looks different when you get a brain . &quot;
all these empty areas , the areas that are through the lines .
and the nature of a particular cell , to be able to make it clear , is that it &apos;s a lot of the 25,000 genes on the turned on and what the threshold they &apos;re on turned on .
now , experts come to play and make basic anatomical populations .
we &apos;re taking it to the material , and we put it on a so-called called a laser call .
so what can scientists learn from this data ?
they look at their entire genomes and they &apos;re trying to find the whole genome , connected to the genes .
whether that &apos;s the individual of the individual background or your experience , we don &apos;t know .
that we know how we can eradicate poverty , we just need to do more for it ?
so here &apos;s a couple more questions .
how do you know ?
so what is the problem ?
well , all right , everything was the same .
and it was made a lot of experiments that all came to the same outcome , so i &apos;m going to just tell you about one .
so what is the best ?
we need this kind of information . we need more of it , and we need to steer policy .
and maybe we start small with things where we are sure that they &apos;re working .
poverty is more deeply predictable than scientific work , and a lack of data about the effects of the brain of the brain of the brain is the question of how to make this reward , but , in fact , esther duflo means it &apos;s possible to find out
so we start , because africa is a certain way of thinking in the field of progress .
and the legend is reported that alexander walked through this desert .
but you could say , &quot; invest in africa with 1,000 languages , and it would not move . &quot;
so let &apos;s look at the countries , and the specific materials and data .
i want to talk to this from the perspective of the capital .
in tanzania , last week , the standard for the standard of the standard was called the standard of life .
if i had to ask them , &quot; what was the world &apos;s best performance in 2005 ? &quot;
because there &apos;s amazing opportunities .
&quot; god &quot; is the journey we all want to be inspired and feel inspired by the universe , which is the life that supports life .

from him , the sound comes from the hippocampus .
or we do this and believe that , that &apos;s what blindness is .
rain . not bad . not bad .
and so , individual cuts . but why can &apos;t i do that if i &apos;m learning a piece of music ?
in this case , the dove of the white , the dove of the russian evelyn glennie , why hearing music is much more than the sound waves on his eardrum .
and it was so big , until the point where it was a little bit of a summer last year at d-rev &apos;s thanksgiving , and rick gibson &apos;s and &quot; &#91; unclear &#93; &quot; million people in tv .

but maybe it &apos;s different .
listen , focus on this kind of thing , which is that you failed when you take four hours .
in robotic engineering , it was always about interacting with things , not with people -- certainly not on a social way of which we would be and people really would help us accept robots as part of our everyday lives .
cookie monster is very , very bad .
the remote decline was a experimenter from our group , in which they used three of the three different technologies to interact with the participants .
and with this technology , you can become the active participants in your grandchildren in their grandchildren , in a way that it &apos;s not possible today .

today i want to talk about how this exponential growing technologies are .
so , let &apos;s look at how exponential growing technology affects health care .
this is an example of this kind of thing .
there are wireless processes .
and i think many of these technologies are going to help us be connected to our patients and take more time to focus on the important , human elements of medicine that are augmented by this kind of technology .
but the current trend in medicine is to become more exponentially .
let &apos;s go to genomics , when we were 10 years ago , the first human being , the cost of a billion dollars .
thanks to the websites like the way of making the data , or the way of improving their data on the ground , or google health , it &apos;s always more important , all of these possibilities on a single way and a way .

and frankie said , &quot; i &apos;m as a 22 at the series , and i see the needle moving up , and there &apos;s blood .

and when we were new , the thought was , why can &apos;t you take the oldest of the most ancient , the &quot; kerosene &quot; rhythms , and combine them with the latest technology ?
well , i think it works because scientists are connected to a ethics of ethics .
it &apos;s significant to the place in the room , because it &apos;s critical , not in terms of where other things are , but in terms of this absolute idea of space , which was for newton god .
and in a relational universe , the only possible explanation that it &apos;s created is somehow creating itself .
and you understand some things better than others , and therefore there &apos;s a more expressive , and there &apos;s a lot of governance , and there &apos;s politics .
there &apos;s another tedster talking about here two years ago , jonathan haidt , who defined his work in three different levels .
and just all of that is going to be there .
and as five months of diving , he &apos;s going to experiment with a complete kind of x-ray .
that wasn &apos;t very successful . and so on and so on .
or philip glass or lou reed or the chemical brothers , who were all played there , they all had their own casa musica logo .
after two weeks , three weeks , four weeks , five weeks .
a little bit of a little bit of time .
and it &apos;s a transition that has just been doing so much with the identity of living , like the memory of the dead .

your talk about the water in living monkeys , and the connection between darwinism and the fact that we all are naked , less , less , less , and we can swim .

and you could mean that there &apos;s one indication .
so we &apos;re a lot of the dna and we &apos;ve collected a lot and we found a lot of animals .
so we know that torosaurus is actually a more serious triceratops .
it looks like it might even be bigger .
we wanted to make a atmospheric architecture .
all the water in the world is served here , so we thought that after you &apos;re on the water , through the water , you &apos;re going to breathe and drink water , you could drink the building .
the drill was mounted on a 12 street .

this particular plant is mapped to the other , and it &apos;s fragmented chemicals from the air .
m the most of the time i need to do that in the morning when i &apos;m going to figure out what &apos;s going to happen .

to be right , today , in their capital , some of the heavy times , the treasury cut and save the treasury like the global fund .
in the contrary , it could save a lot of life .
if we take this metaphor of a genome as a program , you have to think that chris anderson is a key object , as jim watson , and craig venter , and all of us .
you design something like a cell phone , and in very abstract language , you have this mobile phone .
this is normal dna , which is what you think is normal dna .
we heat them , add some salt , heat them almost to the bottom and cool , and while the short strand of the little , the long and it &apos;s making a structure .
so this works really well and you can build patterns and form , ok ?
you &apos;re in particular , there &apos;s only four strands of dna , and you &apos;re sitting on the individual side of the other building blocks that can be attached to other blocks , if you fit .
we have a very reactive computer program where little changes -- tiny , individual mutations -- something that created a square of a size , and make a lot of bigger .
and they used calculations , and to understand that and get better in the handle , how feynman said , we need to build something to understand it .
but as we saw , we had three main centers : a world-class life support of life , which has completely separate , and universal accessible to anyone with a medical physicist , regardless of its financial tools .
in the modern time , where time is a major , and the fight about survival is the ordinary , ordinary human being , and pays the bribe only to come to get to get further .
in my last 18 months , a lawyer , in the fight against small and large , the case of india &apos;s biggest business company .
sm : well , the most powerful cost were less than 200 rupees .
this is the global footprint of all the last four years of the last four years , which is all emerging in the world , from new york to the small new zealand here in the corner .
in such a lot of content , we do mostly a few things to make it easier .
so we use these online tools to find unique talks , which are different in creative fields , and that &apos;s how many different fields are , and that &apos;s the most powerful thing to be able to do , and that really creative fields are going to be scanned
no wonder that my colleagues come up because the truth is hard to digest .
the work of the computer system could be equally good in a hospital in a hospital like this .
at ted , mubarak is ubiquitous .
how do things happen ?
second of all , for you , nature &apos;s known known education of modern american education , the step for step , i &apos;m talking .
and said , &quot; would you be willing to have a nuclear waste in your community ? &quot;

in this salmon , it &apos;s still a genetic pulse of salmon salmon , which is from the intersection of a gene , and another kind of animal that came up with a lot of the food .
these are actually intersections and not real animals .
we &apos;ve taken this animal to his autonomy . &quot;
in other words , this was the first creature in the history of this world , which was a computer as parent -- it had no organic parents .
paul ornish : the time it &apos;s time to question , the serious

evolution helps us .
say it further .
so old and the most successful he might be , he &apos;s very complicated , and it &apos;s very complicated , and it &apos;s the same time .

i kind of sort of put myself in , a geometry of things that actually had no geometry .
she took a place like a few milliseconds to 25 , a remarkable era where mathematics was short from this world to break out of this world .
turns out measurements , big gamble , right ? ngozi .

they &apos;re serious the livelihood of millions of people , especially in africa and china .
a problem with the plants of trees is that people are so poor in this region that they are breeding trees to use them as a bakery .
and , after the balinese cost of 60 dollars , the bacteria that you never have to pay again would have a cubic cubic meter of energy , about 11 dollars .
in a time , population growth , more and more of the growth , could be turned on as a function of growth .
the world shows me opportunities , and i picked up .
our goal is a treasure design process , so we &apos;re so sensitive and completely , that one single single single dvd is basically a viable dvd .
all these eggs , the bacteria , bacteria , viruses , can travel all in one gram of human shells .
it &apos;s a wonderful instrument to the pier .
maybe you think it &apos;s good subtle , if you &apos;re going to move that men off , but it &apos;s also economically economically because every year you save a billion dollars .

and at the same time , the solution is clear because these don &apos;t require the human nature .
we need to actually invest in the notion of an important wealth that offer people to develop .
first , it &apos;s meant to be economists never come out , so it could be that you have to be a little bit more fond of your tone .
i painted it directly on the man .
it was about space and light .
this photograph was taken when i visited the bay bay in alaska to test the mineral management service of the open-source service in the ice , to monitor the ice .
another aspect is that it &apos;s spreading when it hits water .
and that &apos;s actually really really , really , really enjoyable .
and then of course , john d. rockefeller was .
it was also reason for the national school act , the clean air act , the clean water act .
they have degrees in the field of business , in economics . they &apos;re entrepreneurs . they don &apos;t want to do what they do .
if you look at people who earn 50,000 dollars in the years , two children have the two jobs , or more , and then they need to beat up .
we need to do the whole thing about the whole thing , and you can find more about this politics .
the first person you certainly know .
here she tells you in a museum of afghan star , as your friends , she said , because not to be able to leave and say she &apos;s your friends to leave your own friends .
last year , i was talking about my swimming at the north pole .
it feels like someone behind you and you &apos;re going to beat you with a hammer that &apos;s all over the head .
and we put it down , and we &apos;re going to go down , what went wrong there at mt . everest .
so , the idea of that , more powerful , talk about it , and give a hundred percent . because there &apos;s only very , very few things that can &apos;t be achieved when we use our whole power for this .
this is a computer company . it &apos;s a very simple computer .
can we get a kind of a design of design ?
so what i &apos;m going to show you here is that we can create a nuclear movement -- the b -- the b -- from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules .
these are three minutes of work .
and if you saw amy smith , she talks about how to get students with communities with communities in haiti .
and it may be that all of us are going to seem overwhelming to see all the sensations of reality and so that they &apos;re connected to the diversity of problems that we need to solve .
we &apos;re increasingly aware that we don &apos;t need to even have to do the whole thing .
okay . i also have one .
can we get back to the natural ecosystems around us by combining rivers , for example , and that &apos;s the one that we can do ?
as you can see , the death rate of 65,000 deaths per capita in the 1950s in the 1950s in the 1950s to 2,000 dead per conflict in this decade , so awful that is .
because we did something right , and it would be good to figure out what it is .
they want the food industry .
if you don &apos;t , one of the two folds , right ?
the developing world used soap and water , embryonic therapy .
and now i have the most salient at this axis .
and you remember the beginning of the last century , which was very bad . until this so-called big leap forward .
do you see it growing ? and how hundreds of millions and billions of people in asia get out of poverty ?
here we are . we have a continuity in the world .
look . this is the world .
they get clean water . they buy food for the poor . they &apos;re eating malaria .
and we need to think about the way we look at the world with facts .
don &apos;t do it all of africa . don &apos;t make a difference from it .
it &apos;s not sustainable . and it &apos;s not going to happen around a superpower .
and many of you have heard the term &quot; memes &quot; -- evolution of technology is something that i give a lot of attention to , so you know , one of the first things you had was a little bit of a little bit of a baby .
my argument is basically that , well , the only part of our lives were still part of our lives .
and this is quite new , and i think it &apos;s going to be much worse -- this possibility -- because of the developments in technology technology , in the energy system , as a weapons , as the weapons can be used , like biotechnology or nanotechnology .
i &apos;m doing my best , okay .
&quot; the &quot; s is our favorite &quot; means &quot; he &apos;s saved the people , &quot; which was a pretty advanced amount of magnitude of the time .
we only have in six countries civil wars that are just about six countries .
so , how do we put our money into account ?
none of these countries , including africa &apos;s nation , of botswana , has been brought up with his average car .
during this development , we were , the africans , the edges of development , and we &apos;re looking into the world of politics , and we &apos;re looking into the world in our countries .
the administration , mostly , is the cost of the , cost billion .
we &apos;d like to interview them . &quot; and i said , &quot; great . &quot;
and now 14 of the diseases are treatable , two of them even more likely .
so in the last 10 years , and as hope for the future , we &apos;ve seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology : a science of what makes life worthwhile .
and i think there are three different -- and i call them different because they &apos;re for different interventions , it &apos;s possible to have the one rather than the other -- three different happy lives .
but it turns out there was no sexual trauma .
you don &apos;t see how the most powerful news is .
and what you &apos;re finding is that if you do something funny , the most fun thing is .
when i was a designer 30 years ago , i thought if i was good enough to do someone not depressed , not afraid , not angry that i would make him happy .
a polar bear , floating in the arctic , recorded by paul &apos;s .
but these so-called &quot; prints &quot; when all parts are put together and not only the event , but also my emotional connection to that .
nick -- again , with a automatic camera -- thousands of photos shot from this .
sometimes you can tell a rich story on focused ways .
we want to find solutions too .
and then they &apos;re all running and jump .
thank you .
so , more importantly , because this is a very , a very reactive process that you can capture in just three seconds : we can be in a period of less than one afternoon in several different types of energy and more skilled .
emily : image metrics is a computer company , a business activist .
finally , i got involved in it .
in the reserve , there are some beautiful primates .
but i was out of the west and i worked in the east .
all over the world , all the time , animals were killed , and the forest is getting off , and so on .
and there &apos;s coltan permanently , and gold .
one day we met with the most successful .
the elephant just took off and they took the most powerful .
i don &apos;t think anybody can be identified , because google makes the right , even if people like al google use to connect .
djabran ewango : a hero of congo &apos;s greatest
we have almost no noticed to have a market of a market market .
they don &apos;t have to pay it from their budget .
i should be compassionate , which happened with these experiments .
democracy doesn &apos;t need a perfect equality , but it needs citizens to share a common life .
the u.s. as an foremost nation in 1900 , where the line is transforming red .
we have got this gift in the 1970s and &apos; 80s , when women are in the west age .
electricity was helpful in the most popular of women .
an amazing fact for the most important thing is that in the first half of the 20th century , the population expectancy is the result of the life expectancy three times as fast as the second half of the 19th century .
this was the paper i wrote with 11 years and i got a two + a half .
i have some that thought that long , between five and 15 , this is my favorite thing , and that led to a feeling of failure .
so if i look at creativity , i think there &apos;s also this sense or the inability to suppress the connections that i see between virtually everything .
that &apos;s what buddhist fischer says because they &apos;re not being killing creatures .
and they &apos;ll find it more often .
and i had to figure out what to find the story .
how are we going to be the responsibility , what the responsibility and the causes are outside of a dish ?
and you have to be in all possibilities , including that i haven &apos;t seen before .
i hope you can see me when i &apos;m going to talk about these examples , because i &apos;m actually talking about everything you could spend your time .
now there &apos;s magazines about water .
people pay the full price for both , and the only thing they have in common is that they don &apos;t have anything together .
the corners of the script , the one , the big market .
these guys are going to ask the most powerful people in the world .
but you don &apos;t have to be more restrained -- you don &apos;t have to be completely balanced .
so what you need to do is figure out who it is interested .
nine months later , i &apos;m going to talk to you about the news of the tahrir square , and reason was a picture that i saw in my inbox .
thank you .
mostly the cultural heritage tends to be able to get back and to get back and forth the past .
my first documentary for national geographic , which i realized that you can bring environmental problems in a documentary about nature , i had dedicated to the story of nature .
these are the lions and tigers of the ocean .
and because i &apos;m taking sharks -- i &apos;m kind of obsessed with them -- i wanted to be a different , more positive story about sharks to talk about the need for the sharks .
after i left the day , i had found that this habitat will be a new trade system to create a new kind of media .
they also caught themselves in the wild .
but when the fish came back and the sea and the population controlled , the population grew up , growing in the flat water , growing in the ice .
now , you &apos;re living in the jungle &apos;s jungle , and this is the kind of thing that &apos;s called the second son , by the way , the son of the second orangutans i saved , the son of the second orangutans i saved .
it was a biological desert .
and then you see the returns and start measuring what comes out .
so how do we break this cycle ?
and you need bacteria to bind the nitrogen , and without those microorganisms , there &apos;s no performance .
humidity is 10 percent higher .
so we can really change climate .
in the blink of a community , it &apos;s the payback of the , there &apos;s a democratic culture , so you can use the justice system to protect your own system .
the dravidian dravidian , which a paddle on a nazi horse .
i &apos;ll show you one another .
reuben &apos;s bliss creates kinetic sculptures , beautiful works that are moving into the pattern of the brain , and the other things that are moving into the pattern of nine minutes , and in nine minutes , he &apos;s going to tell us about his favorite art -- at
every city has their own design .
23 years later , you asked us to come and evolve this idea .
this is italian portal , the charm park , the northern park , the japanese park , the german park .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
either it doesn &apos;t exist or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or anything , but no part of science .
people always say that consciousness is hard to define .
you can &apos;t solve the existence of your consciousness .
it &apos;s a digital computer program in the brain and to create consciousness , we have to just find the right program .
we &apos;re constantly bringing the objectivity and understandable and understandable as qualities of the reality and the characteristics of the standards .
do you find ?
but i also meet people who are doing what they do , and they don &apos;t want to imagine doing something else .
we don &apos;t teach american history in britain .
teenagers don &apos;t wear any stimuli .
maybe , not immediately .
no , don &apos;t do it .
i couldn &apos;t get this thing to work , no matter how much or how much i do .
but we need to shift from a industrial model to a solar model where every single school can flourish .
erez and i wanted to figure out more about it .
the reason that the historic report is being digitized in the middle of the galapagos .
and she went to a light . she said , &quot; okay , it &apos;s serious .
she led a group of students in a protest in the streets .
i stood up , i got a tea , sat down and everything i &apos;m here -- still almost paralyzed , but here .
so peace direct customization are going to show you the back .
he wrote a book called &quot; from the dictatorship to democracy to the &quot; of the dictatorship &quot; with a drug .
it &apos;s not a kind of a business thing .
in fact , chris worried , and he said , &quot; look , show you this photo , you &apos;re going to think you &apos;re still one of these crazy modern artists that don &apos;t do much . &quot;
it &apos;s a object for the spirit .
and the solution i &apos;m going to do is , the biggest flutes in this massive microwave field of the earth , through humanity and from that , is the destruction of the biosphere .
so i said , &quot; what would t be like to go from the counter -- let &apos;s get rid of him where they increase the effects , in the denominator -- let &apos;s put it in , bring it to the effects ? &quot;
and he was a huge design system on the market that has increased our sales and profits .
we &apos;ve literally won the data test .
but five days later , back in atlanta , i got an email from glenn thomas , one of my people from the meeting in california .
so , frankly , a lot of us are doing that in the industry that the industry is threatened by technology and perhaps the most profitable .
and truly , we need somebody to convey us to make a sense of an experience with an elder divine ?
the arts , whatever you do , will give us a time , if you were to see the water , to look at our way to the world with a child &apos;s disease and curiosity .
the three sisters whistled with her passionate music with the apple music of the new life , and at tedwomen , they start with the jolly and the most respected , and then they play a little bit of a , comforting version of astor breton , &quot; the &quot;
the manchester of the wounded feminine feminine feminine feminine counterparts is named after my neighborhood .
he makes a bunch of money through the use of special furniture for rich people .
we &apos;ve taken the curriculum of the american health curriculum , which is what harvard is about , and we &apos;re looking at a food system for mothers in the middle of the city , and we &apos;re going to live in the middle of the inner city .
we realized that you have to give them flowers and you have to get sunlight and eat sunlight and herbie and herbie , and so you can always heal the spiritual cancer .
these kids who were given up from all over the world , who fly from public schools , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re capable of , with affection and sunlight and the good music and confidence .
and it has worked very well until today .
and i &apos;ll allow you to put the concert , and i &apos;ll give you the music , and you &apos;ve ever got to decide to sell you to sell you to sell a deal that is going to be used to school . &quot;
this is a space of nancy wilson built the album in our school last christmas last christmas .
the brown building , which is what you &apos;ve seen , and i &apos;ll tell you where i made my greatest mistake .
he came to me . he said , &quot; man , that &apos;s a fabulous story .
and so he has a group of people who have a group of people .
bill strickland shares a calm and amazing story of redemption by art , music and unusual alliance .
and the transducer then brings the most powerful to the code to the brain , and the result is a very , a standard that produces a normal , a normal color system .
but there was the key factor , the problem with the code , and how to make cells better answers to make normal reactions , so that &apos;s our contribution .
it &apos;s cover us with an invisible , which is the attacks of the environment , so we &apos;re healthy .
but when the bacteria grow and double and all of them participate , these molecules go up , then the number of molecules that are going to be in the cell is to be proportional to the fuel of the cell .
now we know that all bacteria can talk to each other .
this is just a photo -- a little bit of a movie of your skin .
bacteria have become incredibly reactive , which is back to the point that we kill bacteria .
the fact is that bacteria have a collective behavior and they can make tasks that they could never do if they just act as individuals .
it &apos;s a great honor to get me to this conference .
or the first one that comes in the room .
but , if we think about justice , aristotle says that what we need to think about is the actual character of the brain &apos;s activity and qualities that are worth it , and you realize that you &apos;re going to be able to get them to be respected and
what a reason they would have ?
charlie , what do you say to warren ?
here it is , it &apos;s like the way it &apos;s going .
so aristotle has been in the way that aristotle &apos;s and the legendary question of same-sex marriage rose in marriage &apos;s marriage .
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic debate
many people said , &quot; well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
and i think that &apos;s good -- the future humanity can make such a decision .
so if that &apos;s what &apos;s called this for us ?
i &apos;m saying that the speed of the ice industry is going to be enough .
i &apos;m proposing that &apos;s nonsense .
we know that there are this threshold because we get rid of these things , before we get to a nuclear age , and that &apos;s even though the damage since our birth was born .
that means you have to make your homework to understand whether this is true .
audience : hello . i read somewhere that in the last 20 years , the average lifespan of practically every planet has been expanding in the planet for a very much 10 years .
not one of their media has done that .
we don &apos;t care how to make our profit .
they &apos;re walking in the center of the street , and they put on the agenda .
i can &apos;t stop the most appropriate , the most popular , the arguments that i learned from economists , epidemiologists and environmental communities .
the most scary is something scary , and you probably know a part of the most violent .
fourteen americans die a day of asthma , three times like in the 1990s , and almost everything comes from the name of the .
he apparently had meaning for humor .
politicians and the most responsible have scared to market , to market as &quot; the &quot; police &quot; .
second , because we &apos;ve eradicated them .
so we thought , &quot; let &apos;s try . &quot;
there &apos;s some amazing animals .
immediately , the government said , &quot; enough -- that will go . &quot; and paid people for this , and we pay people to see each other , the most common they saw .
he may think he would have ever been born the baby &apos;s chief , so he may need a little help from the outside .
i asked peter , if something changed . and he said , &quot; no , &quot; no .
we want to talk to africa , the next chapter , and this is : a healthy , more beautiful , beautiful african .
but most importantly , you have to be actively engaged in your life , creating a productive environment in our countries , so that things can be done .
we can connect all this ?
we were on the side of the world &apos;s office .
i had to crawl through these people through these guys , and i had to crawl with my sister on my back to find a window .
you know , we need to use everything good .
and i often don &apos;t see an african staff under them .
now the question is , how can we use it from all of this good will to come from all of us ?
you &apos;re a lot of the time . &quot;
we have superstar experts in nigeria with the most successful .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is effective , i think that this case is so that we can study them , just like we can study any other complex neurological process .
the method has been applied since the 90s to study extremely complex processes .
i want to try to show this for you briefly .
and then i &apos;m in the room room , here , games in the change .
now , how do you study rap scientifically ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity that &apos;s involved in the brain industry .
i want to say , probabilities and statistics , that &apos;s the math of games and the computer games .
that &apos;s very time-consuming and it &apos;s not pleasant .
but keep the mind for the whole time of eight seconds .
in play and virtual worlds , for example , you can of course be used , of course , and intuitively be used to control a avatar or virtual character .
otherwise they just cheated very quickly , and without a stable grid , it &apos;s not possible , so children die .
another statement of esther was that we react when it comes to a tragedy like haiti , but this is a key thing .
it &apos;s produced by malaria , and it &apos;s a very interesting thing to do .
we have every street , every village , almost every square centimeter of madagascar .
in her brain , a very cheap laser is a very cheap laser .
audience : yeah !
and what &apos;s interesting is , although we have the whole time , we &apos;ve never done it , we never did it , the pirate &apos;s aquatic cord .
this is the restaurant acorn house .
this is the one that you see here , actually , in a brain factory , which was made from the outside , and it was made up of the outside .
so , water is a more important aspect .
&quot; metal &quot; and &quot; earth &quot; is still out .
the idea is not sophisticated .
they don &apos;t even enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
once it touches the water , you should hear how air is out .
so once we sequenced these two genomes , we asked ourselves : if this is the smallest genome of a self , it could be a little bit smaller , if you could even have a smaller genome ?
moreover , we realized that once it worked , a real chance of doing this , if we could get the synthetic chromosomes to do it , it &apos;s the bacteria .
so care is a collaboration .
the last one is a quote of robert feynman : &quot; what i can &apos;t engineer myself , i can &apos;t understand that . &quot;
but in fact , we live in the northwest very close to the actual notion of the koran of paradise , which is 36 times as a gardens , and it &apos;s defined by running streams .
but the more you add , the more it seems to be lost .
and these numbers are never coming up .
this is a nest of a euro colony and that &apos;s the nest entrance .
this is a colony that was founded by a queen in summer summer .
the most powerful -- that &apos;s a magnifying glass -- are a very interesting group , and you go out early morning , before the first group on the foraging group goes .
oddly and interestingly , it looks like about half the ant &apos;s sharing , just nothing .
the nest maintenance workers just take all the tentacles and bring them to the edge of the opera .
the foragers are actually deciding , not getting out .
and we did experiments that show that the longer one ant is a more ant , the more simple hydrocarbons on their surface , and so the ants are smelling different ways of doing different things .
they &apos;re pouring down the entire earth , except the antarctica .
here you see that the cost of all of this is about 89 million barrels of oil , and the annual cost of oil is three trillion dollars .
and we do that for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
that doesn &apos;t have anything to do with it .
i &apos;ve thought where we can use natural gas .
and when i was going to the most complex , natural gas is nine dollars .
why don &apos;t you worry ?
it just got 500 million out of it .
it was never taken up the ground of the ground or something .
tbp : i lost 150 million wind , okay ?
some have 5,000 . many have more .
there was a lot of time . and there was a lot of time .
the life is a event . they &apos;re happy to do it .
these are work in lower manhattan , where you built with the first of the top .
there was six different colors in this .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to replace the light bulb .
a friend of mine told me this story : that didn &apos;t just come and wait , but then the most popular , but then the most popular , when they finally were there , they had to call someone phone phone .
so sometimes i &apos;m going to use a more clinical language , and so maybe it won &apos;t be so warm about the heart of the way to other languages .
and here &apos;s the fundamental idea that the most powerful thing to do is lead to people who are going to be engaged in this .
basically , it &apos;s about when you &apos;re my enemy or my neck , if you &apos;re not my friend or my family , i &apos;m a lot less to do that , the golden rule on you . okay .
so , or that &apos;s how the results raise . this is a zero-sum game .
each form of self-expression , physical , power , makes a humanity tell the other .
and then they &apos;re going to explain to them , the other thinking that america doesn &apos;t give them respected and even dominate america , and they hate america .
most of the diseases match poverty , but in the case of cancer , children were able to get children who died in cancer , mostly from wealthy families .
a week died a child , but nothing changed .
because you just don &apos;t use this kind of energy and time , if it doesn &apos;t really care .
so he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
now , the dominant design system would say that there &apos;s a single oncogene in a single cell cell , and that you can make it a more somber .
what does that mean ?
we found a kind of a kind of conceptual material that contained the right extracellular matrix , we put the cells in and lo there , and in about four days , they were going to see the water , and they see what we have produced in a culture
and of course , we &apos;re asking ourselves , where are we going to go ?
and so i want to finish with a poem .
we have a journalist that was caught in the pursuit of the hunt ; a young boy named so many of the most powerful quotes that you &apos;ve taken out of the shelves is that you took it out of the shelves ; a germanic conference in the new york
it sounds a little bit like a strange book , but it &apos;s actually about new kinds of lie .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise !
you had four good friends of a person to contribute their personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can lie to me ; they were talked about , and they were then .
they told them how big the bath was , or said , the most powerful , they &apos;re so far , and so far from the hotel .
and that &apos;s exactly where it &apos;s there . okay , glass , do a picture !
you also want to put your eyes up .
but it really opened my eyes , as i &apos;ve been going from life to the other , social networks and so on , even though there was nothing really important or not really important or not .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band of the steel .
and everybody who then went to the day , i went back .
at least for me , because i always do the same thing , i &apos;m very , very boring , i &apos;m very quick .
i see myself as ... i don &apos;t know what i &apos;m seeing .
are you going to be nervous ?
im : do you worry ? you &apos;re so cute .
anyway , i &apos;m not saying that it &apos;s good , but it &apos;s just not getting tired of it , ok ?
if you have the container too long , the buttermilk will get the buttermilk .
i call it the era of the citizenship -- what people are doing , different domains or ethnic races , but as citizens , they can be the same as citizens .
i was actually discovered in egypt .
this had been studied in london , and in yemen , and they were trained to get a plane to attack america .
there &apos;s no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols that are using democratic culture on the ground .
as a journalist , we can show that if poverty was the only factor , well , the family &apos;s family is one of the richest families of saudi clooney .
what happened there was a political coalition that was going to be a political goal , and that was to remove the leaders .
these tools are only becoming social interesting when they &apos;re technically bored .
he &apos;s going to show the limits of the individual networks and then it &apos;s a lot of the other networks .
and because of the social networking , chinese students who studied in abroad , or companies from the rest of the world , there were people in the world that were listening to these messages .
and finally , the chinese blew up .
we &apos;re increasingly more in a media landscape in media globally , socially , ubiquitous and cheap .
but all of a sudden , i &apos;ll always take a look like me , as i was going to do .
in my fourth side of everest , a comet moved over the mountain .
this view is the most popular up , the first 600 meters of rise from base base base .
and that &apos;s in camp 4 .
and there were climbers on the summit ridge .
we also got the bad news that beck kidman , another climber , put another climber in this storm , and died .
it &apos;s so so determined to work up because i sometimes gave even syringes directly through the clothes .
this climber was a big one .
and i can only easily anticipate how it did .
and so he &apos;s going to turn back into the actions .
these are islamists , the most profound .
and the fourth thing that &apos;s extremely significant for me is , &quot; ideas that we have to share . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , through the entrepreneurial rise , entrepreneurs were becoming an interaction of role models , and they &apos;re wearing a lot of the society in a great scale .
it was a lot of people who wanted to introduce democracy because they bring ideas together , from the universal vote , parliament and constitution and so on .
the third thing is again .
the second is the most popular , which we have , which makes it so difficult to create the normal jobs in companies that are 93 percent of the indian jobs in the world .
so , if you &apos;re a young country , you have the chance to take a modern , modern state of education , so you don &apos;t have the most expensive , if you &apos;re older .
you have to have a clear strategy , which is important for india and important for the world .
so the government decides to let the government go again .
even though some people on the left it didn &apos;t like to hear the revolution of markets that spent the most popular : the government has no idea .
they don &apos;t fear the masses anymore .
so this whole constructive mistrust between the world &apos;s population and the ones that represent them .
so , the instructor .
each of these is a statistically approved , two years after the ted age .
david cameron spent 20 million pounds in a social social school meeting to support this idea .
so , the social change : investment in the social change
i &apos;ve been working . &quot;
why ? are you too tired to get to the cheek ?

the prospect that you could be extinct in 30 , 40 years .
england , america , japan , south africa , congo .
it &apos;s about 380 trillion gallons of oil on earth today , which can be absorbed and nurtured .

it &apos;s not the painting we &apos;d made , but what we &apos;ve actually painted is what we actually made .
another example : again , a stupid mother .
thank you .

i &apos;d like to show you six minutes .
so , the other thing that we do is , but our films , they &apos;re stories , they &apos;re both the stories that are capable of being able to identify .
so it &apos;s a young man out there to get out of what can do , and it &apos;s got to think about certain negative things , and all of this , or any more sophisticated behavior .
thank you very much , so much time , so little time .
i think this is really the theme of this event .
so , you &apos;ve been describing this as a design project of the world .
it &apos;s basically a cd . it &apos;s a cd .
now the art art game . oh , that was fantastic .
that was really fantastic .
video games can be very profound , even though they &apos;re totally biased .

all of it is based on the most popular and students who were talking about the first meeting , that they &apos;re going to deny a place .
so i made some sketches on napkins -- little boxes and things that i normally drew .
it &apos;s one of the most beautiful pieces i &apos;ve ever done .
this beautiful object , the swiss army army , for me , is a involvement for credit .
and one day i had one -- oh , vice versa .
i &apos;ve taken the most thin and the copper , so it &apos;s very thin to the surface .
and that &apos;s my cafeteria .

it was never completed .
the dome was a wish of the most popular .
it was a trial , this thin piece of land -- it &apos;s 30 to 76 feet -- turning into a relationship , by taking these areas separated and the dining room in this pavilion , with a high space in it .

there &apos;s a big difference .
after surgery , everything is going to be .
well , this is not surprising . but we also asked them to grade their honesty and intelligence , kindness and the most .
he married . he had a son called the iliad .
is this business with our own and our employment with a very common phenomenon ?
i want to tell you a little bit about the surgeries that we &apos;re doing , how far we are , and where we want to .
we can replace the bone bone , but we &apos;re not very far with the facial spare surgery .
my theme is food in schools , because here &apos;s social justice .
and the next is the most popular .
people are talking about sustainability all over the place , but we should find out what that is .
do you know that all of you think you have to have more and more food ?
and then , you know , you have the stuff , hey , we can sell the stuff to kids .
and this is a typical computer project .
the things we might do at home , and think of it as important , we need to teach kids to the schools .
we need to educate the staff .
this eight billion means by the way , and 49 cents , and 49 cents -- so much money is ready for lunch .
as a little girl , my grandfather was sitting on a hot horse with me in the sun .
when i go to a party and people ask me what i do , and i say , &quot; i &apos;m a professor , &quot; you will be matt .
i want to know your favorite , everything about your own being , undermining , that you &apos;re a professional in things that are conscious .
don &apos;t make the tension . i &apos;d rather be a more honest .
it &apos;s a documentary in a documentary in the mind of consciousness .
when i got closer , i expected to recognize all the details of most people , their clothes and so on .
where do you know that it was what they did ?
see it ? who &apos;s not seeing it ? that will help .
we start out . some examples .
this morning , jeff hawkins described his efforts to bring a good theory in neuroscience .
and the most popular thing in london said , &quot; what do you mean to be , &quot; who is in london -- i mean , nobody is in charge .
now , congestion pricing were introduced in stockholm at the third january of 2006 , and the first picture , here &apos;s a picture of stockholm , a typical road at the second january of january .
so , we did this enormous survey with lots of plastic programs and trying to figure out who changed and where they disappeared .
then i went to the last day -- from eastern asia to central asia -- through the mountains of the caucasus , the middle east , north africa , russia .
what do we know from the taliban &apos;s rights of the taliban who are going to be brought to the doors of people who are going to send their daughters to schools like in the street ?
the world changed .
i was in my office , my desk was tidied , i had the blue blue director on the walls .
and there were two of them .
there was really something .
how amazing is that ?
i want to talk about some other patients that are doing all of their power to make health care .
and then i realized that the page of google earth reminded me where we can fly to every address .
we are , they &apos;re the most of the most basic resource in health care .
and by seawater , a water system is a water .
here &apos;s the resolution . a wonderful creature , right ?
they don &apos;t take their environment with the help of sound waves , and i &apos;m talking about the most powerful .
in the united states alone , the annual cost would be estimated in estimated at random 22 billion dollars , and so we have the bats in the country .
why should we be involved in aging ?
if you go out here and look at the night sky , and this beautiful , flying animal , i wish you smile . thank you very much .
europe had to be brought into economic development .
the boom of resources is not all available , but but many countries of the bottom billion .
so what &apos;s wrong ? why is it called &quot; the &quot; s &quot; ?
and so the countries of the bottom billion need a very highly crude policy .
a few economists just came in time and said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try a auction ? she &apos;s going to reveal the value . &quot;
in this moment , in the world , a billion people are stuck in poor or more in the world , and as we can help them , we can help them ? the economist paul collier shares a very excited , compassionate plan , which is a very poor
we have no container , where they &apos;re being made .
and he &apos;s putting a professional surgeon in africa that &apos;s necessary to embrace the human disorder .
so , we have this : imagine , imagine you thought , you would think , and you could talk to people in their native language .
&quot; basics of laparoscopic surgery .
14 years ago , i came to this ordinary material , and i was in the same way for centuries , which was used in the same way for centuries .
he asked me if i could build this as a piece of a piece of town for the city .
so we were experimenting with small plastic programs to create a dry fog that &apos;s shaped by wind , and it turned out to be shaped by people to be shaped by people who are interacting with it and to move through without becoming more competitive .
they were in their dorm stores in their backyard , watching the shifting patterns of the world &apos;s brain next to people who didn &apos;t know , and shared the wonders .
so i was also paying attention to this , that this is an enormous risk for our society .
if peter moves his arm , this yellow spot you see is the kind of thing that you see in the way that you see in the wild mind , which is in the most responsible mind .
if you do that , what will you want to control ?
and to say that such changes can be beyond death , even a claim of a fact that can be true or wrong .
now , let me just clear what i &apos;m not saying . i don &apos;t say science can &apos;t have this room to be able to have a scientific answer or that we have scientific answers to everybody &apos;s moral question .
now why wouldn &apos;t this undermine a objective morality ?
how high is the probability that this is a peak of human development ?
on the left , you see edward ornish .
we live in a world full of technology technologies and these technologies cannot be seen , it &apos;s always easier to break together , and it &apos;s always easier to break together .
but then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
and what &apos;s his natural enemy , what the resources of the good beetle , which we &apos;re talking about ?
it &apos;s a parasite , not a , not a , but a bioluminescent wasp , two mm , a rapid , and agile , a quick and agile .
and if we put these good online problems to this , they go to the flowers .
in israel , where we &apos;re on 1,000 acres -- that &apos;s true , 10,000 israeli , which is , in the same 10,000 -- biological pest control , are used in the absence of drugs , 75 percent of the pesticides are cost .
third , to increase the awareness of farmers &apos;s potential to the potential of this .
so , the most exciting is one of my favorite projects .
it &apos;s even fun to make fun of the more remote fun than you do , and i often do it .
&quot; urban food , &quot; that &apos;s what the new yorker needs .
her name was a little bit of a name , and so it was -- i wasn &apos;t going to say , &quot; take the drawing . &quot;
or the collapse of the soviet union only found some decades , maybe within a decade , after the soviet union , the soviet union was the most powerful .
because there &apos;s 80 percent out there , which really eat insects .
they &apos;re at the beginning of food food .
why do we actually do these balls in the soup , it &apos;s actually meat anyway ?
it &apos;s 25 pounds per person , a year .
so , until now we decide to make a , or to five kilograms of output .
we can increase them a little bit on cost of rainforests , but there &apos;s a little bit of a boundary .
and you might think , well , these are not available yet .
my three minutes haven &apos;t begun , right ?
he said , &quot; ah , we have to put them on the table .
and i saw a sign .
even if canadian the system is going to do it , they do it in a way that society is going to be good .
and in this book , the little lewis would find the big idea .
this is a computer game . and on the back , some other scales are a few other scales , and the other scales , and scales , to make some calculation . okay ?
right . so , the device is used .
there &apos;s a quality of craftsmanship and precision that just is amazing and remarkable .
so , the first robot i want to talk about is called &quot; strider . &quot;
it &apos;s just used to show that if you have cameras or other sensors , it &apos;s high , it &apos;s a meter of 80 big , you can get over obstacles and the surface of the street .
for example , in this case , although the left and the right wheel is connected to a single axis , and so quickly quickly , it &apos;s spinning fast .
welcome to the robot , the robot mechanics lab of virginia tech . &quot;
but the cool thing about it is the interface .
so , let &apos;s see how he does . this was our first attempt , and ...
but what is the secret of our success ?
but just from a piece of imagination to talk about the imagination is not enough .
it &apos;s a very important education .
and the key thing to do is to be the test .
there &apos;s basically no pool of good teachers , and only eight percent of the people in the county have a more likely degree of a car or a higher degree .
there &apos;s a complete empty operation in the creative capital in bertie county .
the goal of the game is , all the team on wheels , they have won up , then the team won .
in the last few decades , but a lot of money was a lot of money for christmas center , completely gone .
and after going out and interview the neighbors about what food you buy and why and why , is a homework .
in these words , it &apos;s literally impossible to create big , very tenacious surfaces .
i &apos;d like to invite you to follow my journey of the day and exploration .
after four months , goldman sachs , and now it &apos;s a break of nights before .
here &apos;s some results .
this global action is going to change the same way to change climate change , like fossil fuels , maybe even more than that .
when i learned about these two things , i was very , very , very , very important for a personal reason than it was for scientific reasons .
it &apos;s got a very good job of the design of the united kingdom , which was partly from the ronald mcdonald &apos;s foundation .
so , after treatment , we &apos;re going to make a series of simple pieces of simple data to see how to adapt to the face of sight .
the answer is motion . i want to show you the next video .
i had to discuss a long time with my wife .
we &apos;re going to track this research and hopefully have more results to report .
and then , i have this kind of personal , physically disabled line , and i thought , oh , i don &apos;t know , but before i get about judgment , i &apos;m looking at what this is like .
but that &apos;s the fall of &apos; 95 and then when the winter was cut , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , it &apos;s got to get to the celebrity &apos; r , and she &apos;s very excited . her family travels with -- it &apos;s a big thing .
i tried everyone i could , who i could , against who , against whom , i &apos;m going to go to the shelves , who i &apos;m going to go here ?
i always had everything , and i thought , what ?
you can be big . just take it off . &quot;
rs : aimee and the designer will be executed two and we &apos;ll talk about the design .
they got somebody who came over and the shoes were going to be the shoes .
but it &apos;s almost impossible , the actual losses of the economy , because we &apos;re using math .
or to the 75,000 jobs .
and something about mathematics : math sometimes looks like math -- like this one -- and sometimes it doesn &apos;t -- how do i get drunk ?
in math math , we use about 80 percent of the time to teach people how to do it , and how to do it .
if people ask me , is that true ?
but the patterns in cars allowed it to separate these things , so that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing today , and they &apos;re going to do something else than they &apos;re learning .
totally wrong .
but i think we can do both of these things at the same time .
and one of the reasons why this is so important -- so , it &apos;s very important to the test of the computer .
it was winter in 2009 , and i &apos;ve been blind for about a year .
i was particularly thinking about my father who was dying of an ngo , so that was a surgical operation on the brain .
similarly , just as you get through the handle of the body , which can change change of the soil , and the time is a notion of where you are and what you &apos;re going to be in .
but when i was in denial , and the broadway went along , i was blessed to everybody &apos;s corner .
if you design a city in the mind , it will be many , many jobs .
to give you a sense of this experience , the article was called &quot; i think we &apos;re going to be a breath . &quot;
and the most famous thing i knew -- the 10 commandments , love your next commandments , is fertile and the most fertile .
you give money for a good purpose and creating emotional practices on purpose .
it &apos;s not a book that was written and was written by heaven .
so , this is actually the key to me , to remember , that there &apos;s no way to remember that there &apos;s a car that &apos;s going on here , and i don &apos;t go up on the road .
that was very inspiring for me .
so if we want to really be interested in this book , we really need to be able to get to it , and we really have to be able to get into it .
so we have this wonderful progress .
the academics were thinking that this was to be too detached , so we &apos;ve developed the applications , so we &apos;ve developed the same chemical applications in the water that &apos;s going to be a laser layer on a laser factory .
alex worked on a small , something obscure , independent , independent , with the name &quot; minority report &quot; and invited us to develop the interface that &apos;s going to be used in the movie .
we &apos;re going to have this kind of carbon surgery because we like yellow and we like to sleep on green levels of wood .
let &apos;s pull the apart : i &apos;m going to bring it into a plastic .
we , as humans , are the things that are making things and we should make sure that our machines help us and build it .
john , thank you for the way that you &apos;re doing art fiction .
what okolloh did was not have been possible without digital technology .
but here &apos;s the point . the most powerful creative act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that are represented by this black line said , &quot; we &apos;re changing this deal immediately .
they &apos;re created by the members of the community for each other .
and as all good things do , they make a leap of 20 years when the interest of the audience changes .
you don &apos;t always have five days to get it . so changes and we started playing more health games .
india didn &apos;t want to play at the heart of the game .
the other was indian cricket .
it was the new india ? that was another world where you could get player from all over the world , as long as you got the best player for the best price .
we &apos;ve all had games in calcutta , but so we &apos;ve never seen any of the public history , and the audience was brought the audience with a computer project to the computer , for calcutta , not for india , but for calcutta .
could you imagine that day would come to come ?
hopefully i &apos;ve made any of you to make a experience and the game , and hopefully there &apos;s a longer time , and hopefully there &apos;s a longer time to work in that business .
and you know that the answer is , because they have quickly drawn into memory , as they often saw dogs and pigs in the rope .
why in the world should anyone play the lottery ?
on the other hand , if you visit a developing country , and for 25 dollars a computer , it can buy a big mac for a big mac .
would you spend your remaining 20 dollars for a ticket ?
i &apos;ll give you an example .
and if the way to the other end of the city is 100 bucks worth 100 bucks , it &apos;s 100 mice worth it , no matter what they &apos;re going to be . but people don &apos;t think so .
well , in the big and all you &apos;re enormous .
watch what happens when we stop dropping out of the air .
dan , i would like to hear more . so , you say that our answer to terrorism is , i mean , it &apos;s a kind of mental error ?
there are no guns in the way .
and so some people look at economists as a stupid person .
and the theme and variation is one of these most powerful , which requires a certain intellectual activity , because you &apos;re always comparing the variation with the subject that you have in mind .
&quot; in words and in fashion , the same rule / so fantastic , &quot; is that the first one is trying to do that , and not the first one , the first one that &apos;s been tried the old one , has been the old one . &quot;
and i woke up one day and i said , &quot; well , maybe that &apos;s not that ? &quot;
first , my willingness to be able to put me on a critical audience without suggesting i &apos;m sure i &apos;m sure .
it &apos;s my intention to go to the poster , you should not have understood it .
so , in the big and all of them , they &apos;re our survival .
jews often have a uncomfortable smell .
if the space was drunk , we could see that people are giving more negative attitudes to gay men .
it &apos;s as if i &apos;m going to talk about what i &apos;ve done in the distance in the distance .
it feeds my mind and my soul .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends , other filmmakers , and they talk about what cinema means .
without food , i got sick .
we don &apos;t need problems anymore , the idiots .
our government was corrupt .
so for me , the thought that we have all these kids , it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of children that had so much psychological trauma or damage and africa to live with it .
through the whole book , more than an hour , more than an hour , and interactive animations .
what is the business ?
it was at least that you could find them , with whatever true , largely true .
so i thought , &quot; yeah , that &apos;s a good idea . &quot;
they still talk about it .
when i came from college , i worked in southern california , and you were working on the spanish of the gulf and the things that are .
rsw : how is his schedule ?
the most powerful -- they &apos;ve interviewed me for interviewed and sent their technical technology to bilbao .
that reminds me of this .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
if you walk four months to walk around three months , the ideas are getting more clear and more living .
and one thing i wanted to mention in my favorite word , but somehow , was to thank everybody , to thank you all the business that helped me do it .
but the meanwhile , these things win momentum .
and this is 10 weeks later , from hand .
you see the suits , the most powerful .
the fallacy of the styles and things is remarkable , and this is what the most remarkable thing to be .
it &apos;s an incredible endeavor , 15,000 workers , i think , five domes , and the sixth will be built here .
on this level , they work around the 1,500 workers .
50 percent of the computer on the world are growing up in china .
it was quite unusual , so stefan , less than five percent of advertising had a picture of the main theme .
and wish three is : the first thing i &apos;ve been told is , i was going to make myself a , and i always wanted to do something like this .
and it &apos;s increasingly important that we can figure out how to extract these resources from these extremely complex complex structures .
the traditional ways , to separate material , is just not working for plastics .
the traditional way , to make , is to make oil or petrochemicals .
at the end of this process , we have a mixed species of plastic : many different kinds of plastics and lots of different qualities of plastic .
now i see a lot of the most powerful ones out there .
and what we see is that people tend to make mistakes on the exact same kind of same way , again and again .
maybe we should study how monkeys are going to make economic decisions and find out whether they make the same stupid as we do .
here &apos;s summer conference . she &apos;s going to trade a token against food and wait for your food .
she &apos;s waiting to get a little impatient that the market opens .
imagine now that i &apos;m touching a thousand dollars of a thousand dollars in the hand -- 10 more and a hundred dollars a long time .
you can either choose a loss of loss -- so , i throw a coin . in head , you &apos;re going to be really losing a lot .
if we made the same scenarios in our little little business , they would be the same things like people do ?
the person on the left is a safer loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just the people who are in the last stage of development , making stupid errors .
and that &apos;s the catch .
but if we think about wood buildings , the most often four stories are high .
we have to have less concrete and steel and we need to build more . in recent years , we &apos;ve worked on the more recent .
this is as much as we would have less than 900 cars in a year .
tobacco curtains , of the windows , of the windows .
maybe &quot; citizens , &quot; because recently they got up to fight the decline of justice . the citizens of these networks work together to help each other .
and the biggest and oldest bank in russia , largely in the core of the russian government , is now using now to rediscover employees and citizens in the development of innovations with human trafficking .
we &apos;ve heard about ted , talking about people who have their plants with arduino , and they &apos;re working on the whole world , and they &apos;re working on the whole world young people , websites and videos .
and so i started thinking that the eternal mother always asks , &quot; are all the kids there ? &quot;
that &apos;s compassion .
he asked them to convey a message , and all read in their own language was a central , big one of the golden rule : &quot; what you don &apos;t want you to do , the most powerful thing . &quot;
a pastor is called to take care of these individual needs .

there are 180 messages in washington d.c.
it &apos;s taken from parks and sculpture .
it &apos;s made of fiber fiber fiber .
there &apos;s also some constraints on its lighting .
the bubble is a water factory .
i saw my aunt raped when i was only five .
one of the things i experienced when i was trying to eat my friend because we didn &apos;t have food and we were around the 400 .
as a child , as young as the baby i can &apos;t forget , words that i can &apos;t forget .
this is my story , shared in a context of a lesson .
my breakfast , my lunch , i give up a foundation that i started , because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give farmers a tool .
audience : yeah !
the third chapter is a still more complicated , called &quot; escape , &quot; the echo of the trickster .
that means more than 60 percent of it .
we &apos;re going to solve this task by expanding the problem of death .
and even if that happens , it &apos;s not too late .
i remember nothing from time when i was five years old .
santa claus knows if you were good or not . right ? &quot;
but julie , julie , you were ready for school . you were ready . &quot;
they looked at each other and smiles , in the sense that was the right answer . then they kept asking , &quot; do you believe that we all are brothers and sisters on this earth ? &quot;
maybe your bigger ability to cooperate and adapt ?
i think this film shows the toughest view of the modern times : &quot; the road . &quot;
in world war ii , we had to produce a lot of stuff .
but we can &apos;t forget that it needs a fundamental contribution , and that &apos;s how many resources of the planet we use .
but now , the good news !
it &apos;s perhaps in latin america .
and at this point , the skeptics and the climate change in nature is in vision .
we did a project for a few years ago , and a big program , it meant : the most important thing , it was : with many , many people -- many of them were involved -- a huge diagnostic system .
a group of people who spend it for themselves and to spend the other group should spend it for other people .
when they went from the first building to the second , all of a man , who went to fit and went to come and make sure , and clearly help . the question is , did you think ?
the word is &quot; the &quot; s &quot; , a combination of &quot; the &quot; s &quot; and &quot; the &quot; s &quot; .
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &#91; about &#93; : the hidden life of the common life .
since then , there are four decades -- i &apos;ve been training with the best in this area , in the world , in the world , in the world , and i &apos;ve taught young and old , created , created , building , and a wonderful net of
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my passion , my real life life .
i danced between the software and i was drawing him , and i was desperate to adapt to my favorite .
well , it was essentially frustration .
that &apos;s how it was at the time .
he put them together , and they put together something called a little bit of a little bit of a body , and then he was carrying it into this software that i think was originally designed , and he made this wonderful presentation .
in these documents , there are little pieces of glass , little boxes .
i &apos;m going to suggest , yes , make a nice website . how could i say , you should not make a nice website ?
now you ask the linked data that you &apos;ve now put together . 32 hits each of which each protein is with these characteristics and you can look at them .
and that &apos;s linked data .
all this will lead to each year every year , two million children die , last year , when 2000 .
and if it &apos;s like , are we ready to collect feedback , and give them feedback , to make sure that the promise really results ?
you just show one of the numbers there , which is 5,000 -- is that the number ?
my brothers started to draw my tips for drawing and painting .
so that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been fascinated with , this area .
how many of you have a cow going on the street to mysore from bangalore to mysore ?
it &apos;s just that we &apos;re trained to be a human being , and that makes the reality of the importance .
and they said , &quot; okay .
can &apos;t you do anything , you &apos;re artists ? &quot;
this is a box from a box of a box .
because if we see somebody walking away , we see the footprint .
what percentage of it made foreign water companies ?
obviously , he sat in a cave for the last 20,000 years .
so foreign capital is actually a great way to get here , because -- if you think about it , i &apos;ve talked about the economists today , i think , that most of the things are very much more powerful .
this is the place i showed you at the beginning .
we &apos;re going to be a technical problem now .
think about toyota .
you can &apos;t do it against a little bit , so you accept it and find it out to work with it .
it &apos;s very hard to agree .
it &apos;s a lot of the time and the water .
pizza is you get to the people when you have hunger .
there are millions of different types of energy .
so remember , if we think about sexual education and activities , they &apos;re out of baseball .
it &apos;s from the poet &apos;s chen , and it goes like , &quot; i can &apos;t tell the word of the word .
and that &apos;s what a lot of percent of the day do you think of ?
over the course of over the course of 93 societies , people have leaving this kind of brain structure .
they came home with the food of dinner .
and it was really a strong force .
and i say , &quot; why do you think men are more fond than women ? &quot;
no time at that time , the women were so educated , so interesting , so interesting .
she &apos;s 23 she had taken her for 13 .
i started to love why you &apos;re more in love with one person when you go to the other .
they &apos;re going to be as long as the human race is on what shakespeare called &quot; these carpenters spiral . &quot;
but unfortunately , i know it .
most researchers believe that obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
maybe we should ask ourselves , could it be that insulin resistance is the cause of weight and more profitable diseases -- at least most people ?
other people , it &apos;s too much more .
peter mcchrystal : what if our views were wrong ?
my great , henry ford , really believed that it was the mission of ford motor company , and the life of people to improve the lives of people and make cars affordable for every affordable .
and the good news is that today we have the great problems of cars and environment -- not only ford , but in general than industry .
i think you can imagine it already .
but what really inspired me is the possibility that we &apos;re going to have when our cars start communicating .
we need a infrastructure that is able to support these flexible future .
this is a minute 59 .
i think my mother , i &apos;m like a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of ted form .
the nurses have to go through data .
that &apos;s really important . it &apos;s much more important . &quot;
so what &apos;s the come out of this ?
and for us , it was great because we won a lot of awards .
i was infected when i was 17 , then when a student was a student , i saw adults who really believed me to do my ideas , and i was drinking a lot of the most exciting things with me .
now it &apos;s all about the kids . so we don &apos;t .
basically , we gave the kids a simple task .
we have a few wonderful images for them , for a really good purpose , to make money that they will give us to buy hearing aids .
but what i never said , and what i &apos;d like to do clearly is that the cool thing is that it &apos;s cool .
in a way , in the elegant or the other , available product here , that we have a year of the day , the most responsible , which is another kind of development -- and inspired by the incredible way of the sensory experience .
if you think about the change in our society , the most responsible of the country in the cities , the 200 years , the same process happens in 20 years .
it looked ahead , even though these were unknown .
so , for example , we would put the models in a globalized sky .
i think a reduction of 94 percent of the city is almost in a near part .
and as we &apos;re doing in this growing world , something more like a few places that i &apos;m talking about -- china , for example , is going to build 400 new airports in the next 10 years .
and this is the focus of the design talk -- there &apos;s no lighting in the positive sense that is healthy and our well-being is supported ; without proper darkness .
unlike the first office , i showed you the beginning of the talk , this is a very famous office office , which is the most popular .
behind them , you see the building building , which was later a single icon of modern life .
i think what you &apos;re seeing here is quite amazing -- how much light in the sky is never reaching the ground .
this is not very pleasant and more powerful .
they &apos;re not being disturbed .
when our favorite team , as a few weeks earlier , a war in a third of india called india &apos;s disease , is called the subject , he got the theme , he got the issue wrong , he got rid of the subject .
and one day -- i don &apos;t know what happened -- while i was walking home from the office , i might see a honey , or it came to me in the sense , could i be like a honey , that life would be wonderful .
anil gupta : but what &apos;s used ? what was it used ?
to do what ? to break stones , to dig .
this is the only place where they could express their creativity .
they don &apos;t want to vote for standards and food services .
and this is what &apos;s done , the most powerful thing that &apos;s called the water .
i had to .
mr. bliss , who lives with a physical challenge , only 50 inches tall .
so , the most powerful , the most powerful .
this is a little bit of a game .
these are 3.2 billion people .
or ski . it just makes fun and people love it to do it and do fun things .
so we &apos;ve worked very , very hard , but we knew that it wouldn &apos;t be so hard to develop the technology as the acceptance of the things that can be used , and how the technology can be used .
cars are not made for the side of the boat ; they &apos;re wonderful , wonderful , to drive them between cities and drive , but think about it : we have all the problems in terms of the range and speed .
so if we could add this box to a few years , we have a solution for transportation , electricity , and communication , and maybe drinking water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 kilograms ?
conservatives or explicitly suggest that people who die there are somehow involved in drugs . we take the fact that they either tortured or professional or professional or even both .
los zetas are represented as a composer of psychopaths , which is fear and horror in cities , and the press is getting to the silence , and that &apos;s true for most .
mexico and the united states , now , is to actually move to a truly international organization that &apos;s been able to do partnerships with the production of the south and global partnerships .
but also part of it , a month , in fact , to be a month -- you live in the future . and we have a long time of food .
and after you fall under a critical price , it tends to be successful , if you &apos;re successful , a very critical mass of a little bit .
but they &apos;re going to be very , very cheap , and you see the interesting effect . if you &apos;re getting cheaper , brands , the most powerful and so , the most powerful , the most powerful , win .
if you look here , linux is in red , it has 20 percent .
&quot; open accessible &quot; is really , you know , the gift of silicon water on the world .
because of some of the technologies we &apos;ve talked about .
patient capital works between the best of the one , trying to take it out of each other .
the second thing that it had to do was be extremely cheap .
president obama understands that .
because one of the poorest farmers in the world had found access to a technology that allowed him to change his life .
and yet , this is the exact properties of the men and women being honored by all generations .
they remember , during the computer department , the most popular news in his blog was often about the hurricane and the most respected , and that was just possible because blogs are easy to use .
i like music , and i like the most cosmopolitan , and i think i heard steve martin play and said , i can also .
i wrote this post , and i took this to einstein .
and you see this post .
these little things just .
and maybe i have to be involved because i &apos;m involved in this , when i &apos;m talking about it .
he was sustainably in , except from our generation .
we need to use this process immediately to get a better understanding of how the oceans work .
we studied these fish , but we had to learn how to keep them .
but that &apos;s only half the size of the largest tuna we &apos;ve ever tagged .
they come together . that could be sex under the tunas . and there it is .
you can put a lure -- it &apos;s a little bit of a seal -- and a white shark will go to it , a little bit of a creature that comes up with the very close boat .
and then these animals even give us a encore , by helping us .
and the white shark .
i think he didn &apos;t think the record of my blackberry were so precise .
they said , &quot; besides the one we &apos;ve talked about , they are groups that want to harm the united states ? &quot;
you don &apos;t have to waste your energy .
and now , who &apos;s looking at my favorite , i see that i was there , and white , i &apos;m in the ninth may for $ a dollar in the foyer .
all of these moments of moments i &apos;m going to push a computer on my life .
when i started the project , people said , &quot; why would you want to say , what you &apos;re doing and where you are ?
now it &apos;s very normal .
now , look at this kind of thing , please , in paris , to see how incredibly quickly growth is .
i looked at thousands of these clinics , and trust and efficiency are always the same elements .
how do we copy how trust is built by face to face ?
i was kind of a mind in the system .
this page is going to ask you to ask yourself , and 80 percent of it gets a precise answer .
let me start with a paradox .
and here you see it in relation to the degree of inequality that i showed you , which i &apos;m going to come back to .
first of all , with the rich , developed countries , and then in a second of the second , the 50 american states -- with the same question : cutting the more unequal states on all these scales ?
with devastating effects , what &apos;s affecting the benefit of talents of the population .
and in our analysis of american states , we find the same opposite .
the social judgments are taking the judgments , and fear of this judge .
or for example , why violence is more powerful in more unequal societies , because people are sensitive to being verifiable .
a year , more than three million squatters , a new knee , or a new knee .
you remember kamal thought about the most popular .
if you wear it under pants or a rock , or a sari , it &apos;s very clear that you &apos;re wearing a prosthetic , and in societies , in which disability is a social stigma , people are sensitive .
so thank you .
you want a dirty magazine ?
i actually bought the most popular of the training , and there &apos;s a little paper that says , &quot; use these things , not to put juice on juice .
this is the results that are going to continue to the 20th , &quot; google just just &quot; so many &quot; o &quot; as there are pages .
strong fear is a fool .
but if you &apos;re always in this condition , the work would never be done , because you would say , &quot; oh , i found a new way to do it . &quot;
almost everything we do is subconscious .
it &apos;s about being safe in this world .
the theme section would be rusty and would fall apart , then they would never be a ride .
it &apos;s a very small sample -- you should not be the results of the results .
i &apos;m going to talk about kids and self-organization and a series of experiments that led me to the idea of how a alternative education could look like .
and at the evening of this day , 70 children in the internet .
so i could even choose to put a cross-section of a cross-section that &apos;s partly the whole world .
what you &apos;re seeing is obviously a child that &apos;s going to use the computer .
natural systems are all self-organization : galaxies , molecules , cells , organisms , societies -- except the debate about the theory of &quot; smart designer . &quot;
and it &apos;s about doodling in this whole book of idealism .
i bought with a nice suit , and i wore shoes with a little bit of the paint and i had this remarkable access to the other .
but 2002 , when my tour went to end , i decided i didn &apos;t wait to go back to the job in london .
i felt that something was destroyed .
and i went through . i went through this kind of big amount .
and i went to kosovo and gave the government to the government .
independent diplomat is part of a trends that comes in the world , obviously , and shows that the world is fragmented .
it &apos;s horrible that they are actually affected these people , not the most important .
this is the politics of the 21st century , and in some sense , independent diplomat represents these miniature , this change that happens with us all .
&quot; hey , could you even get me more inclusive ? &quot;
because if we go back to the world , they understood that this is a simple mistake that you can &apos;t say , or can &apos;t be aware of what you &apos;re like , or remember why you love something .
we feel awe , pity .
go .
what is the number one ?
no . in the &apos; 70s , the sensual show , &quot; the world &apos;s favorite show in 1973 , &quot; followed in the top 10 , followed by &quot; the &quot; &quot; the &quot; three angels &quot; and &quot; three angels for charlie &quot;
i can choose it from the island .
and i &apos;m very pleased to discuss with you , i &apos;m going to go in and say , &quot; can somebody please explain the basic framework and why that &apos;s so cool ? &quot;
next of this virus virus produces this virus virus that chop up the bacteria .
from a series of reasons .
or even worse , scientific education will always be more like the guy who says , &quot; actually ... &quot;
but we have so much work , and if somebody is involved in science , i &apos;ll ask you to join me with it .
we climb up the staircase and we understand a state of consciousness .
so many books about war say the same thing that nothing is people that come together as war .
durkheim believed that everything we used to do is take a sense of sacredness .
he kept saying that &quot; the &quot; s and &quot; the people aren &apos;t going to connect and can &apos;t be able to move out of a little bit . &quot;
he uses the other .
once they were all in a same tribe , they could keep the benefits of cooperation for themselves .
it &apos;s about connecting to other people to rely on ethical ideas .
jh : thank you very much .
i realized that hubris didn &apos;t just have to be inside .
and right next to the garage , he has his own family , where he can go into his achievements , which is a more important role in the most important place .
everything is always easier in design , and here &apos;s this kind of carbon , and , my god , i just photographed it .
&quot; the end of print &quot; is now printed to the fifth of the screen .
this book is called &quot; the &quot; s . &quot; it &apos;s another word for quotes .
this is actually an experiment for a client , and it &apos;s a client that we made a sequence of six photos , and we tried to get people to the printed medium .
they said that people didn &apos;t like them .
a paper about brian gardner -- a really boring article -- i put all the articles in the street magazine .
somebody told me today , there were these things that &apos;s called the folder , but i don &apos;t know what that is .
this is pretty high for most of the professions .
before that , there was obviously no technology . but obviously .
this is not another planet . these are things that are hidden on our planet .
and finally , i come back to this kind of research .
this is a little bit of the design of the arts , he was in stephen jay &apos;s theory of the theory of the computer .
we heard about the oil of the , and we &apos;ve heard of guns .
and i think that &apos;s really important . because if you can imagine mozart before the invention of the technology of the technology of the technology , what that would be for a loss of society .
octopus was interested in the first time when i was very young .
he reaches again , takes a arm full of gravel , leaves it -- &quot; the same thing that &apos;s going on , &quot; the same thing happens .
but the point is , we were a month for a month , and i wanted to get the animals to get us to see the behaviors that we could see without to take them .
and if you go down , it will be beautiful blue water , which you &apos;ve left to start and get a lot of time and you get a lot of time and you &apos;re going to go and get a lot of time .
but there &apos;s no sun down there , there &apos;s no photosynthesis , it &apos;s a world &apos;s worth down there , which is a bit of a bleeding and it &apos;s all so volatile .
but i also saw the exact opposite of the opposite .
everybody talks to each other . then it &apos;s not a slow dots on a map , and it &apos;s a network that we have created .
she was a t-shirt , and she and i didn &apos;t go and get us out and i did not get a little girl , and she didn &apos;t buy me a pink reporter , but she knew , you know , she knew that , you know , a
my parents had a divorce , and my sister was arrested .
cities are the gateway of civilization .
is edinburgh a horse ?
and we &apos;re doing the whole economy that we have , in the corner , on the left , the same .
the heart rate reduces , you live longer , a practice of plastic , and nutrients from the membranes , etc .

children in the 12th grade are less enthusiastic from political systems .
he had to speak in high school in a high school .
my students made this stereotype as a result of a task that we had asked to be in terms of oil spills .
this is my favorite student , because it was taken tuesday when i was going to go to the election to go to the election .
and with that , it &apos;s just like this .
you could actually -- you can &apos;t go -- we don &apos;t go .
it &apos;s a computer system .
and he asked a very important question .
and i &apos;m going to show you the 15 million dollars of this .
you can see the stem cells out again .
many of these patients are hard to dry .
the european union , the same .
and even though i don &apos;t have patents , i &apos;m aware of it , you &apos;re going to meet some of my inventions today .
you know , of course , what that means .
and they have happened to have all this progress in such short times , and they &apos;re all so young .
thank you all .
in school , i actually have an organization of engineering , which is a kind of a design force that makes you know how you would , you might like it and so .
she was also very , very painful , but she was so full of the name of &quot; anger . &quot;
my daughter -- my daughter wrote this , she said , &quot; start your talk always with humor . &quot;
i &apos;m a lesbian . &quot;
i want to hold your hand .
and then i finally got a call to last year , that i should talk directly to the ted phone .
and i thought , if i could write books where this world was small and connected , i might maybe be human for the problems that all affect us , and maybe even move to the world .
and john said , &quot; bet to good people who do good .
there was no specific media company focused on the public interest .

i learned that there &apos;s not only one right way to change .
what do you think a lot of policemen are on this taxi ? well , three .

this is our first patient , just out of the street , and now look at this chair !
these are the most powerful of my device , or our brain system .
i need to serve . &quot;
this is in the scottish parliament .
they &apos;re putting them on a very special diet , and they treated them with great care .
his app was only the only way he won the prize of the prize .
but there was many debates in tunisia , as you should have this problem , mr. .

it has been waiting since 1960 , when a professional hardy , a marine biologist , said , &quot; i think our ancestors are in the water for a time for a time . &quot;
but the absolute connection is it works only in one direction .
and then the fact that we are rotating .
for example , professor ted . he understood it .
so if it comes and if it &apos;s going to happen , who &apos;s going to hold it ?
first , i want to be able to make a fair name .

and every time i talk about what i want to do , i &apos;m going to talk about why body is meaning .
so this particular instrument is called the most powerful thing .
they &apos;re shrinking and they melt at the same time -- and some are gone .
that would not be a big problem , because if we &apos;re in a continuous stream , we would be buried our arguments , invest , invest , and find a way to get them out .
this is data from the u.s. coast of congress , you show the most powerful prediction of what would happen if the current conditions and trends continue .
the rock is sacred , and when people circle together , they unite , they can trust each other , they &apos;ll be one .
and the most popular and the most powerful knowledge , for which the site you should vote for .
for many reasons , the decades after the second world war was an historic world &apos;s time .
there we are as a country .
we &apos;re going to be a nation with two classes .
this is really a social disaster , and the liberals are very concerned about it .
but there &apos;s not yet . so i have to make them .
they &apos;ve been in the field of time for time .
you see that in these twin areas that the protocell actually moves away from light and moving into the dark side of the dark .
it &apos;s been done to me almost three decades of hospitals , and i &apos;m probably proud of the most proud .
instead , i &apos;m a ph.d. professor for law law , psychology and psychiatry at usc at usc of law , i have a lot of good friends and a beloved husband , who &apos;s also here today .
i quote my record : &quot; i had my classmates , &quot; i had my classmates , and val at the friday shop in the dance room , where we wanted to work together at a homework .
and then they put me on the bed and they were stuck with the bed of the bed .

i could let them go and do it , and we could do it very , very well , &apos; ha ha ha .
the american prisons are full of people who are hard to have mental illness , and many of them are there because they never got a reasonable therapy .

these are four billion hours that are going to be missed in this country alone .
