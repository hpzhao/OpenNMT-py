you know , one of the great most profound acts of travel and one of the pleasures in the world &apos;s research is to live with the people who remember the old days , and they &apos;re still touching the wind , they &apos;re touching the rain , they touch
just knowing that the world &apos;s still beyond the milky way or the importance of the fetus is even full of the oldest of the inuit of the inuit , or that the buddhist is still the breath of the world &apos;s breath , means that the world &apos;s the
and of course , we all share the same thing .
we &apos;re all born . we &apos;re bringing kids to the world .
we go through the street .
we have to be able to get the wmap separation through death and so we should not surprise it , we &apos;re all singing , dance and art .
but interesting is the unique logical note of the code , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
it doesn &apos;t matter if it &apos;s about the world &apos;s most important , or the u.s. boomers in haiti , or the warrior in the most of the world &apos;s brain , the people who are in the andean hemisphere , or a more , in the middle of
all of these people teach us that other people are more useful , other ways of acting on the earth .
and that &apos;s a notion that , if you think about it , can be hit with hope .
together , the myriad cultures of the world are making a grid of the world &apos;s brain , and the cultural lives that are the earth &apos;s world and that &apos;s probably important for the earth to be known as biological logging , which you know as biosphere .
you can imagine that cultural cultural model as a matter of a design , and the way you can think of the world &apos;s health care , and the other thing is , the myth of all thoughts and dreams , myths , and intuitions , and the intuitions that
the most amazing legacy is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all that we are and what we &apos;re experiencing as amazing species .
and as much as the biosphere was very much refined , this was what happened to the most important speed .
no biologist would be to say that 50 percent or more of all species are just before extinction , because it &apos;s not true , and yet , this -- the most profound thing on the area of biological diversity -- is not the most of what &apos;s known to
and the key indicator of this is the extinction of languages .
when everybody was born in this room , they were talked about 6,000 languages .
now , a language is not just the total of the vocabulary or a series of a series of plastic .
a language is expression of human mind .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a particular culture is going to find access to the material world .
every language is like a forest forest of mind , a turning point , a thought , a ecosystem , an ecosystem , spiritual opportunity .
and from these 6,000 languages today , as we &apos;re sitting in monterey , we &apos;re not going to have half the ears of children in the same way .
they &apos;re not taught to be taught for infants anymore , and that means if nothing is done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely than being the silence of being a person who &apos;s going to talk to you , the last of your people who talk to your language , not to have any possibility to give the wisdom of the ancestors or hope ?
and yet , this terrible destiny actually , in fact , in the earth , in the world , about all two weeks , because all two weeks , is a elderly , dies , and takes the last iteration of a old language with the grave .
and i know some of you say , &quot; is it better ? &quot; is the world not better , if we all would talk to a language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; well , let &apos;s be fooled by this language . let &apos;s say , &quot;
let &apos;s be kogi . &quot;
and then you would suddenly recognize how it would be if you couldn &apos;t speak your own language .
so i want to take you in a journey today , and i want to take you through the ted process , a short journey through the metal , to try to understand them , which is actually lost .
now there are some of us who are actually forgetting that when i say , &quot; different possibilities of his , &quot; really different possibilities of his own .
take a look for this kid of the amazon in the northwest pacific , the people of the world &apos;s largest , believing that they &apos;re going to be the same of the east of saint snakes , in the belly of saint snakes .
this is a people who doesn &apos;t different between the colors blue and green , because the forest of the forest , the people who depend on people , is the most dependent thing that people depend on .
they have a strange language , and a more disturbing language called the linguistic idol , and you have to marry somebody who talks to another language .
all of this roots in the globalized past . that &apos;s curious about these big houses where the most of the house in which the country &apos;s day is , because of the six or seven languages , you &apos;re never going to hear anyone who learns a language .
they just hear and start talking .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes i &apos;ve ever lived with , the most amazing people in the northeast of ecuador , a remarkable people who was in &apos; 92 .
in 1957 , five of the objections were trying to take contact and made a mistake .
they &apos;d put the potato pictures from the air down , which we would think of as a friendly gesture , and what they &apos;re doing is that these people were never seen a little bit more violent in their life .
they raised these photographs from the forest floor , trying to see the face , or the character , didn &apos;t find anything and the character , that this is using business business , and killed the five objections with the spear .
but the most important thing that was killing was not just the outside of the spear .
they &apos;re going to be on each other .
54 percent of the deaths happened through the deaths .
we went back to eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death and when we were people with a decent thing , they gave them that one of the people who had gotten so old was that he was killing it by his age and we
but at the same time , they had a clear knowledge of the forest that was amazing .
their hunters could smell a nation of 40 steps away and determine what animals of this one .
in the early days , i got a really amazing task , when my professor asked me to go to harvard , if i was interested in haiti and to democratize the secret societies that were the bedrock of the strength of the strength and the kind of strength that
so to give you a sense of this big deal , i had to know about this remarkable belief of the ted belief , and a beaver is not a cult of the black magic .
in the contrary , it &apos;s a complex metaphysical worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i ask them , the great world world , what would you say ?
christianity , islam , buddhism , or whatever .
a continent will always leave out , because the guess was that in sub-saharan africa , there was no religious belief in sub-saharan africa , and of course , there was a beaver that &apos;s very profound , and the very low-tech , the very hard religious thought of the
but what a beaver does is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living lines are the spirits .
the minds can be made by the great water , respond to the rhythm of dance to protect the soul of living , so that the most harrowing moment for a little bright moment is going to be god .
the most important thing is , the most important thing to say , &quot; your white goes into church and you talk about god .
we dance in the temple and we &apos;ll be in god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with the mind , you &apos;re going to get off the mind . how can you get damage ?
see this amazing demonstrations : the most amazing demonstrations in a museum , the red coal without burning , a remarkably controversial visualization of the mind that the body is so much to influence the body that this is the most powerful thing that it &apos;s going to be in
now , from all the people i met , the kogi were from the sierra nevada de santa velde in southern kenya , the most impressive .
offspring the old state of the ancient civilization , the heart of columbia , who moved to colombia , and in the end of the city , this people in a foreign form , which is going to be in a very powerful way , which is rising over the
in a hotel continent , these people were the only ones who were never approved by the most violent .
until today , you &apos;re going to be doing a ritual priesthood , and the priesthood is very extraordinary , but it &apos;s very extraordinary .
the young school industry will separate from three and four years of their families and in a world of darkness , in the base of the glacier , for 18 years , and two times , in the river , to mimic the most of the nine years of pregnancy
and while this whole time , you &apos;re going to be culturally introduced to the values of your society , values that sustain the claim that your prayers and only your prayers -- or we could say that ecological -- balance .
at the end of this amazing , you &apos;re going to be a day , and then you get out of the first time in your life , in the age of 18 years , you see a sunrise , and in this particular moment of consciousness , you &apos;ll
it &apos;s so wonderful . you need to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers for the destruction of the world .
now this is a level of intuition that &apos;s going to be very important .
whenever we think about the landscape of native and landscape , we either get more sophisticated and the old notation of the fancy wild , which is a secret thought , or the other , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we do .
so , native sex , neither sentimental , nor you &apos;re going to be the nostalgia of the nostalgia .
it doesn &apos;t stay much longer in the world &apos;s life in the srebrenica 30-year cycle or the cold winds of tibet , but they still have a mystery of the earth , which is not based on the idea , and it &apos;s a very subtle intuition that is
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little child from the andes who are growing in the belief that the mountain is a mountain , which is the fact that you will be a whole , or your destiny , will be a whole different person , and a different relationship to that
whether he &apos;s a devastating of a mind or a bunch of a bunch of a mind , it &apos;s irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of british columbia , and i believed that these forests are there to become a plastic of being there .
and that made me a different person as my friends under the most violent , who believe that these forests of the mid-ocean of the world &apos;s and the curved spirits are the most marked and the most profound spirits that are living in the world , wanting to support
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries .
it &apos;s a photograph i took only last april in the pacific the amazon .
this is a lot of a bit of the time that you &apos;ve heard of the most of you who have the most powerful , most powerful , the repertoire of the pig &apos;s repertoire .
what makes it fascinating is not just the most powerful potential of this animal , but it &apos;s going to be a really different way of doing it , and it &apos;s actually made out of two different sources on the one side , there &apos;s this wooden bar ,
this plant contains some very strong amounts of energy that the serotonin , and the very similar , very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the most sophisticated , as you &apos;ve seen this stuff , this substance that you &apos;re making out of various species also .
this powder is about being taken from a kind of a laser party , and the landing of the red paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to be able to make any bias , but the resolution of reality .
i even have with my professor , richard evan , who had the man who had the most powerful of the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the world &apos;s book , and i said that you couldn &apos;t be able to put these things as a hunting
but the thing about the technology is that you can &apos;t get rid of it , because it &apos;s in the human gut of course , of course , of course , of the brain , of course , called the gene &apos;s .
you can only be able to get into a certain variety of chemicals that the mao &apos;s computer &apos;s worth of oxytocin can be .
now the amazing thing is that the most important thing that are in the world &apos;s brain chain , are the same way that &apos;s necessary to be able to get the energy industry . so ask yourself , you &apos;re yourself .
how can these people find out of the 80,000 species of the world of 80,000 species of plants that don &apos;t find these two of these two pieces of labor , which is , if they &apos;re in this way , a kind of a kind of a kind of
we use this great euphemism , trying and error , which turns out to be meaningless .
but you say , &quot; the plant is going to say , &quot; the plant is going to talk to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the most violent , have 17 varieties of plastic , which you all recognize in great distance in the forest , which is a way of view of our eyes .
and then you ask them how to convert their online design and say , &quot; i thought you &apos;re going to understand something from plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you &apos;re adding every 17 varieties of the 17 variants in the lung and you &apos;re singing in a different fashion system .
now , this doesn &apos;t bring a doctor to harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than counting the world &apos;s disease .
now , the problem of the problem is that even the people under us who have the hard situation for the native people , they consider the most powerful and more powerful , but they &apos;re looking at the past , but they &apos;re actually limited to the past ,
so , the fact is that you &apos;re not going to remember the 20th century , in 300 years , or technical innovation , but rather than a era where we were present and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth either active or more ambitious
all cultures have always been involved in the dance with new organizational devices .
and the problem is not the technology .
the most popular thing was not to be less on sioux than they and arrow , and the arrow of tasks , when americans stopped being americans , as they end up with horse and their tasks .
not change and technology threaten the integrity of the computer &apos;s integrity . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of the rule .
and wherever you can see , you &apos;re going to find that these cultures are not the decline of the decline . these are dynamic living peoples that are displaced existence by visible forces that are being displaced by the way that they can be , and they &apos;re in
or if we go into tibet , where i &apos;m going to work a lot of work , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of the political dominance .
you know , the genocide , the most prolific extinction of people , is generally convicted of people , but the most important thing that the destruction of the lives of people are not getting is not just not a fool , but generally , and in general and the
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering of estonia if you haven &apos;t seen it on a level of water .
i traveled to a young colleague of heroin , and i went from heroin , and i was just as a result of the dismay of the statistics that i saw from the dismay of the statistics that i was hearing , and i was just seeing the face behind
the father of this young boy was identified as a followers of the prison .
that meant that during the chinese invasion immediately , he was killed immediately .
his uncle shoots with her holiness in the diaspora , people who brought people to nepal .
his mother was imprisoned when she was punishment -- for the crime of the wealthy .
he was in the prison of two years in prison to hide under her own , and it couldn &apos;t live until it couldn &apos;t live .
the sister who did this brave was got a laser in a museum of a computer .
one day she came up with a set of a set of paper , and for those of you , she had to have a heavy labor camp for seven years .
the suffering of estonia can be islamists , but the most important mind of people is a little bit more nuanced .
and at the end of the , we &apos;re really in front of a choice , and do we want to live in a world of the world &apos;s world , or in a world of diversity ?
margaret ornish , the great anthropologist said before she died that it &apos;s her greatest fear that we &apos;re moving towards a thread , and we &apos;re not just going to see the whole range of human imagination , we would see that we would see the whole range of
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species have been there for 600,000 years .
the most popular revolution that brought us to agriculture , and we &apos;re in this moment of the cult of the cult of the proton , which replaced poetry of the priesthood by the priesthood , and hierarchy , and then created a hierarchy of specialization , and was created
modern industrial world as we know it is not 300 years old .
now , this snake story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we are in the next millennia .
if we ask these myriad pieces of human beings to ask the sense of human beings , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we will address the possibility that we are : people with full consciousness , who are aware of the importance that all humans and gardens can flourish to be able to flourish and have great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took at the northern end of the mountain , when i went to the air floor , and this man , i told you a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the canadian government is not always very good with the inuit , and during the most recent years of the u.s. war , they were forced to move in settlements .
the grandfather refused to kiss this old man .
the family , the fear of his life , took him all the guns and all the tools .
now you know that the inuit don &apos;t fear the cold before the cold , they used them to their advantage .
the most popular of her sled were originally fish in the south of wine , made in the south of a plastic .
the guy &apos;s grandfather didn &apos;t fear the arctic night or the flying storm .
he was looking outside , he had his pants off , and he was going to be in his hand , and when the feces began to go to the sink of the world , he formed them in the form of a a button .
he &apos;s going to blow down the side of the mountain and when it was completely frozen , he was a dog with it .
he &apos;s the dog , and he &apos;s a tutor , and he took a certificate , and he was doing a fulbright , and he &apos;s a tennis scanner , and he was a different dog , and he was a different dog , and he was doing a
you can &apos;t do anything like that .
and this is a symbol of the resistance of the inuit and all indigenous species in the world .
the canadian government gave the inuit in april 1999 , in 1999 , the complete control over a field that is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new country , and it &apos;s called the internet system .
it &apos;s an independent area . they all control the whole of the water .
an amazing example , like a nation , a state , the most powerful , and can reach to the people .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have traveled to these distant goals of the earth , to realize that they &apos;re not even removed .
they &apos;re the most powerful of somebody .
they represent parts of human imagination that go back in past times , and for all of us , the dreams are going to be the dreams of the children , as the dreams of our own children are part of the experience .
what we ended up trying to do in national geographic is that we believe that politicians never do something .
we believe that the fact that we believe that we don &apos;t believe that we have a compelling thing , but we believe that storytelling can change the world and we &apos;re probably the best institution to make the world &apos;s best , and we &apos;re probably going to get
1.8 nations send our transportation care .
our magazines are reading by millions of millions .
and we &apos;re doing a series of travel in the world &apos;s field of view where we take our audiences to places like this cultural wonders , that they &apos;re blind from the time , and hopefully they will be able to take a look at the other one that
thank you .
what i first told you , as quickly as possible , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we call microsoft as part of a single record of a single year , and that &apos;s a very recent one , and it &apos;s a environment where you can
we see many , many geeks on digital photographs here , which you &apos;re zooming on and constantly modified , the pan , and the dawn of all the way to set up .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photographs of a camera , but this one is a scan of the library of congress and it &apos;s in a field of 300 to 300 years .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that &apos;s going to be a system like this can be captured in the number of a system , the number of pixels on your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of the design of design .
this is a game house of dickens . every column is a chapter .
to prove that it really is about a text and not a picture , we can do something like this to really show that this one real representation of the brain and a picture is not a picture .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a more , a more powerful way .
i wouldn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a very big case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a section .
and that &apos;s really the pleasure , and the good experience of reading a magazine or a newspaper is to read what a medium is with a couple of scales .
we also have done something on the corner of this particular issue of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a false ad with very high resolution that is much higher than a normal display , and we added additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technical consultants .
and this really reaches these ideas , these limitations for the space in the screen .
we hope that that doesn &apos;t mean a smooth and other nonsense -- that shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , the mapping is a really obvious application for a technology like this .
and i &apos;m not going to spend a lot of time here , except to say that we will also contribute to this area .
but these are all the streets in the united states .
the top on the top of nasa &apos;s head .
let &apos;s take a difference now .
this is even live in the internet . you can get it out of it .
this is a project called the name of the name , which is really two different technologies together .
one is a very good research , and the other is a very good research about the world &apos;s sake of a university of washington , who &apos;s in the university of the university of steve , in the prison of steve .
and rick ornish &apos;s research was done . a very good collaboration .
so this is live in the internet . it &apos;s driven by the internet .
you can see that if we can make this kind of point of view where we can penetrate through images and make these kinds of compounds of compounds .
but the spatial level of the images is actually important in fact .
the most common ones have taken these pictures together , and they put them in the real space that these images that are all in the near world &apos;s face of the canadian twin , they &apos;re going to be here , and they &apos;ve been able to put these
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ve got to show you other environments .
there are which is much more urgent .
i &apos;d like to show you a straight place of the original data data , and that &apos;s from a early prototype of the street that we &apos;ve been working on in summer to show you what i think it really is the punchline behind this technology that is the
we had to do it because of the lawyers , i want to worry about .
this is a reconstruction of the cathedral , accused of the whole computer with images of flickr , and just give them an opera lady in flickr , and they &apos;re just going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the top of the house , and they
so this is all the way that they &apos;re all in the way , and they all are in the way to get together with each other .
and we can navigate that very simple way .
you know , i never believed that i will end up working at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
i suspect you can see that this is many different cameras : everything is about professional standards of professional standards , a pretty large number of them that were all in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;ll find some of the weird ones .
many of you are covered by faces .
somewhere here , a series of photographs -- here you are .
this is actually a poster of notre dame , which was really recorded .
we can shift from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point is that we can do things with social environment , and it &apos;s going to be collected now from all of the collective stores of the whole collective memory of how , visual the earth looks -- and everything is connected .
all these pictures are connected to each other and it creates something bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes out of all the earth .
look at this as the sequel of the work of stephen earth &apos;s work .
and that &apos;s something that is through the complexity that people use , and the use of using it is increasingly becoming bigger .
their own photos are going to be with a dose of cow , which has a different person .
if somebody has been doing the hard , and all these sacred artists have identified and tell who they are all , then my photo of the permian is suddenly carrying up with all these data and i can use them as a point to get into this room ,
and of course , disgust all these are the immense rich models of each interesting , interesting part of the earth , which is not just through the oil images or the computer images and so on , but by collective memory .
thank you .
do i get you ? your software is allowed to be able to be in a certain period , within the next years , all the images that are used by someone in the world , basically , in order to connect with each other ?
yes . it doesn &apos;t make anything else .
if you want to make them in the other way between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think about the abundance of the crocodile information , which have many of these images .
as if you do a design for images , where you &apos;re putting sentences and the text of the website , many information is about what image that is .
but how would it be like the image of all your pictures ?
then the magnitude of the crocodile is the fog of the crocodile and the abundance that makes it really enormous . it &apos;s a classic computer model .
blaise , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , how i hope to be able to communicate with other things that you &apos;ve heard about , and i &apos;m going to try to make myself a few connections if you haven &apos;t noticed these .
i want to start with what i call &quot; official , &quot; as we call &quot; official . &quot;
the official of what ?
the official oil organization of all western industrialized societies .
the official business company works like this : when our goal is to maximize the common of our citizens , it &apos;s all about the most sophisticated of the individual of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom is good in itself , valuable , meaningful , a sense of the human premise .
if people have freedom , each of us are to do things for themselves , which is our most powerful maximize and not to decide for us .
the way freedom to maximize is to maximize choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more common they have .
this is , i think , so deep in our water supply that it would not be in the sense of trying to be able to question it .
and it &apos;s also deeply rooted in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what &apos;s causing us modern progress .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say a little bit about the more of the time .
there &apos;s 55 of the major in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t have the 10 extra extra spots , and 12 of them you could buy to make a big number of their own lettuce , in which the improbable case is not the $ , the $
so that &apos;s how the supermarket is .
and then they go to the top store , and they put a stereo -- speaker , a radio , a radio , radio , and they have a business store , and in this one electronics , there &apos;s a lot of stereo .
we can put together the other million different stereo , and we can put together the components that are offered in this business .
you have to admit that this is a big choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a young boy , because you could have a phone , you could have a phone , you wanted to have a phone of ma bell .
they rented your phone . they didn &apos;t buy it .
and one episode of that was that the phone never broke .
these days are over .
we have almost a an infinite choice of telephones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- the most cosmopolitan , and taskrabbit , and taskrabbit .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that until now in your business , you can be sure that you &apos;ll soon be .
and what it does is it &apos;s bringing people to the business and to ask this question .
now , you know what the answer is to this question ?
the answer is no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
in other aspects of life , which is very much more important than buying objects , the same explosion of choice is to be the same explosion of choice .
health care -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor and the doctor , we could do a do or we could make b .
a has this benefits and risks .
b has this benefits and risks . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says , a has this benefits and risks and b , and demand .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not it . &quot;
the result is -- we call it the patient autonomy . that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a shift of responsibility for the meeting of someone who knows something -- including the doctor , is not a decision -- and that &apos;s not the best
there &apos;s an enormous marketing marketing for people like them and me , and that when they think about it , they don &apos;t make sense because we don &apos;t buy them .
why do they advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , you &apos;re expecting us to call the doctor at the next morning , and to ask a change of the prescription .
something like this is a question of our identity now , as a result of the point of the point .
we don &apos;t unite identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re so often inventing how we want to .
that means that every day , if you wake up on the morning , you have to decide what a kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time where the most important one was that almost everybody had one and the one they were so fast , and then so quickly kids got like they could .
the only true choice was , &quot; who , &quot; not when , and not what they did .
now , it &apos;s just to have all of them .
i teach wonderful intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i marry ?
should i get married later ? i &apos;m going to have kids , or do i have a career ? &quot;
these are all the other things that are all about .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions regardless of whether that means to make all the tasks that i &apos;m going to give you and not a good grade in my class .
and in fact , they should do that . these are important questions to be asked .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl shows , with technology that allows us to work every minute from every single time on the planet -- until the most salient hotel .
there &apos;s a corner of that i &apos;m not going to tell you about , which is the work that works the way .
i &apos;m not going to tell you , because i want to use it .
so what it means is that the very least freedom of choice we have to make decisions , again , and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can see our kids playing football , and we have our mobile phone on a hip , and our blackberry on other hip , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and even if you &apos;re all down , every minute we &apos;re going to cut in our child at cut a child &apos;s , we should also ask , &quot; should i accept this call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even though the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; is it certainly going to be the experience of your child &apos;s worth of life , as it would have been .
everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , is a question of choice .
and the world we lived in was this .
so i want to say , there are some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world we &apos;re looking at now is this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to do something about what &apos;s bad about it .
all these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , a way of making it , is that he &apos;s going to be fooled .
so with so many options you can choose , people will be very difficult to decide to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this , for a study of investment in volunteers .
one colleague of mine had access to the top of the football system , the giant , giant , about a million employees , about 2,000 different jobs .
and what she found was a 10 year-old people who offered the employer to hold up the participation of two percent .
they provide 50 more of them -- 10 percent less employees , and they &apos;re just going to take five . why ?
because it &apos;s 50 more to represent the choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide what you should choose to put it on tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , of course , never come .
you know , that &apos;s not just the people who have to eat food when they go to the retirement , because they don &apos;t have enough money to do it , it means that they &apos;re going to miss the decisions that they &apos;re missing great amounts of their
they don &apos;t use to be in the span of 5,000 u.s. dollars a year from the bottom of the day , who would have been happy to reproduce their contribution .
paralysis is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it &apos;s that the world looks like this .
they want to make the decision really right if it &apos;s for all the eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment , or they &apos;re not going to be the wrong thing .
so this is the effect . the other effect is that even if we overcome the paralysis and make a decision , we end up happy with the outcome of choice than we had the opportunity to decide to decide less .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is in terms of the great choice of different forms of information when you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , which is a perfect thing , it &apos;s just a little bit of a decision to have , and it &apos;s just
the more opportunities there is , the more difficult it is to regret , that &apos;s disappointing for the choice they meet .
second , what economists call the most of us .
dan gilbert made a big point of this morning by telling how much the way we evaluate things , depends on what we &apos;re comparing .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternative to remember , it &apos;s just attractive properties of alternatives that you &apos;re arguing about , that makes you less happy with the alternative , which you &apos;ve chosen .
here &apos;s an example . for the one you don &apos;t have new york , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what you should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple of the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . they have everything for themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; damn man thinks &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my neighborhood is gone .
i could park right before my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks from the thought that he missed the possibility of day , a great parking parking .
so , the happiness of happiness , the happiness we get through our choices , is also when that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been chosen to have .
and the more opportunities to be able to make the more attractive qualities of these choices are going to take into the most attractive .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon makes some words .
he &apos;s going to make a statement of life now and maybe things about things .
but a more important point that he &apos;s doing is , always , you decide to decide , you don &apos;t choose to do other things .
and these other things like attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to be what they &apos;re going to do less , and they &apos;re going to do less .
third : the codes of expectations .
this has been struck by me when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i wear jeans , almost the whole time .
and there was a time in the only one that had only jeans , and they bought them , and they have bad control , they were incredibly reactive , and they were just getting laid out enough and they &apos;ve been beaten away , &quot; ok , &quot; ok
so , for a lot of new jeans , to buy the old jeans , i went to the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple of jeans , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the salesmen said , &quot; do you want a wet , easy , or a long way ?
do you want the buttons or one ? stone or acid ?
do you want jeans with holes ?
you want to cut down the bottom , and wake up , blah , blah , blah -- and so on , he said .
my jaw was down and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way that was the only kind of thing . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour of all these damn jeans , and blew the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best jeans i &apos;ve ever had .
i had better . all these choices had allowed me to have better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain it to myself .
the reason that i felt bad was to have all these available possibilities , my expectations for what a good few jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations , when it was just in a way .
when they came in 100 ways , they would have been a perfect one of them .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i used what i &apos;d been expecting to do , and what i was expected to do was to be in comparison with what i expected .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to add out of possibilities in the lives of people &apos;s lives , the expectations of people are likely to have the expectations of how well they will be .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even if the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because if you would , you know , you don &apos;t know what it is .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is , that was more than anything worse than anything worse than anything worse , it was possible for people to make a comfortable surprise .
today in the world we live in -- we are wealthy , industrialized citizens , with perfection than expectation -- the best for you ever hope to hope is as well as you would expect it .
they &apos;re never going to be comfortable because their expectations , my expectations , are fine .
the secret to the design of the world -- that &apos;s what you all came up with -- the secret to the world &apos;s brain .
i want to say -- a short moment of time -- i &apos;m married to a woman , and she &apos;s really very wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have better do it . i didn &apos;t have to get myself stuck .
but shut up is not always a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of a bad hair sitting in a bad hair when there &apos;s only one kind of buy that if you &apos;re the 28th , and you &apos;re wondering why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is , what would you have ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy one that is the disappointing , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
it &apos;s also clear that the answer is to ask the question : you .
they could have better do it .
with 100 different kinds of jeans in the cockroach , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , if people make decisions , and even if the results are good , they feel disappointed about it , they &apos;re willing to be willing to be willing .
clinical depression exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i think a significant -- not the only , but a significant business model to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experienced the because their standards are so high , and then they have to be able to be their fault .
and so the most important thing is that it &apos;s generally better , objective , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official oil company that we all think is right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that is better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choices than something more .
there &apos;s a magical amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we have missed this point for a long time to make our greater productive .
now , as a rule of policy -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a rule of law , which is about thinking about thinking about this , which allows all these choices to be able to make wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard of many of them whose problem is not too big .
your problem is that you have too little .
so the things i &apos;m talking about are a strange problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating about this and angry is , steve gorillas told you about how this expensive and difficult car seats didn &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy , that they don &apos;t help .
they &apos;re actually hurt .
it &apos;s worried that we &apos;re not standing there .
if something that makes people the ability to make our society so much choices to the societies in which people have shifted little choice , wouldn &apos;t just be improving the lives of people , but our dignity also improves .
economists call this a more powerful application .
so , the point is that it &apos;s all better -- not just the poor -- because all these big choices are so abundant .
finally , you read this cartoon , and you &apos;re looking at this cartoon , and , a more advanced person says , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know anything in this room . &quot;
impoverished imagination , a kind of a view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
the more i thought about it , the more i came to the view of the fish .
because the truth is that if you break the most of the time , it &apos;s all possible , you have no freedom . you have paralysis .
if you break the most of the time , everything is possible , it &apos;s lower happiness .
it increases the paralysis and lower happiness .
everyone needs a design system .
this is almost with perfect security -- potentially for the fish , definitely for us .
but the most important thing is that the most complex thing is a recipe for misery , and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before , about the human genome and what it might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we start from a new point : we &apos;ve been digitized biology and now we &apos;re trying to get from digital code to a new phase of biology by designing new lives and build .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask meaningful questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something i think many biologists have tried to understand and that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to simplify it to the minimum components .
we &apos;ve been discovering almost 20 years . when we sequenced the design of the design , the shift of the analog world of biology is to digital world .
now we &apos;re trying to ask , can we live life or can we make new lives from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma , which has the smallest genome of a species that can replicate itself in the lab , and we tried to do that , and we &apos;re trying to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it on about a hundred genes of the 500 , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
but if we look at these metabolic map that is very simple , compared to our . trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we look at all these genes we can eliminate one of the genes that we can eliminate .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to actually engage the same chromosome , which allows us to vary the individual components and to ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so , with the question , we started enriching chromosome ?
so , what does the chemistry make this really big molecules that never had before ?
and , if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ?
a chromosome is by the way , by the way , a piece of chemical material .
our steps at the ballooning of life were exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code is very slow , but yet , our last point is to put on an exponential curve .
we started with 15 years ago .
it actually took a few years of a radio review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out that it &apos;s very difficult to be very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters , but it &apos;s a very important process , so the longer you make a piece of money , the more mistakes .
so we had to develop a new way of putting these little pieces together and the mistakes could correct .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x .
it &apos;s a little virus of bacteria killing .
we made small pieces , made a error error and a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting stage when we took this piece of plastic , and we put this piece of plastic into a bacterium , and the bacteria started reading the genetic code and made viral particles .
the viral particles were then brought off from the cells and came back and killed and kill e.
recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said they understood this model right .
they laughed more than they do here .
so we think that this is a situation that is actually able to build the software in the software in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much further . we wanted to build a whole of the chromosome chromosome . it &apos;s more than a more than a more cosmopolitan letter of genetic code , so we thought we could build it in tapes from the size of the virus to
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information really has to be accurate .
when we first sequenced the genome 1995 , the most sophisticated base of a pair of base pairs was a mistake .
we found 30 mistakes in the business of 30 , and if we had used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to create pieces that are 10 letters long , and that &apos;s what i need to do with other pieces of pieces to build smaller amounts of carbon and build smaller amounts of water that fit .
we &apos;ve built unique elements here .
you may have heard that we &apos;ve built a lot of time .
think about it : we have a design code : a , c , g and t.
so , this letter -- these letters -- that letters are about 20 amino acids , and there &apos;s a single purpose for each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we only signed up .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we &apos;ve engineered the pieces that we could just break them off with enzymes , and there are enzymes that are going to repair that and bring back .
and we started making pieces , starting with a piece of pieces that were in the five to a little more and more educated letters , to put these together together to put these together , until the to get back to the ground .
in every step we &apos;ve produced these pieces in the surplus that we could sequence them because we tried to create a very robust process of what they &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we tried to get the point of the design .
so , this looks like a laser camera .
if we get to these very large pieces -- with 100,000 pairs of pairs -- then these aren &apos;t just growing in e. coli , and it &apos;s all the way to do the modern molecular biology . and so we used other mechanisms .
we knew about a mechanism called the world &apos;s climate plan , which is used to repair biology to repair dna that can bring these pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s a organism called the &quot; aw &quot; -- the three million rads of radiation .
you see in the upper field that its chromosome will just fall apart .
12 to 24 hours later , all of this has put together as it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely dried , they can even live in the vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure life can be in space and move to the search of aquatic conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there &apos;s a lot of it out there .
here &apos;s a video of the molecule that we &apos;ve made by using these processes -- actually we &apos;ve only used the design of the right design with the right design , we put it together . yeast pulls it automatically .
this is not a regular school system .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it with the oil system .
these are footage about a long six seconds .
that &apos;s the publication we &apos;ve done recently .
these are over the letters of the letters of the code , it &apos;s the largest molecule with the fabric of the structure that has ever been created by people .
it has a nuclear reactor from over 300 million .
if we would print it with a more of 10 and not distances , it would include the pages of the same genetic code , just to get this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we turn it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple with a virus , it &apos;s a very simple thing to deal with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier to be in the way that you &apos;re in the way that you &apos;re in the way that you &apos;re going to be , you just take the nucleus out and you have another inside , and that &apos;s exactly what you all heard about cloning
in the cell , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but only recently we &apos;ve shown that you can do a full filter of a cell to another and then put it into it .
we put the chromosome in a surface of a brain , and roughly , these two are the two as people and mice . we gave some of them to destroy this chromosome , we could put it with enzymes to destroy the chromosome , and we &apos;re going to
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this is the end , but we tried to bring something further .
this is the most popular of evolution here .
we &apos;ve all taken species of species here that have a second chromosome , or a third of the world &apos;s , every time , thousands of characteristics in just a second to a species .
so people who imagine evolution as a gene that has changed a lot of the biology .
there are enzymes that are called the most sophisticated ones that are actually being drawn into dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell was none , the chromosomes we &apos;ve added .
it was made in the cell and realized the other chromosome as alien material , and we had just had one cell with a new chromosome .
it &apos;s a blue because of the genes that we &apos;ve added .
and after a very short time , all the characteristics of the species had lost and converted completely into a new species based on the new software that we have given into the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;re running through .
it may sound like genomic logging , but we can , by moving the world &apos;s forward , things quite dramatic .
now , i &apos;ve been describing that this is not the most important thing -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i have argued that we may be able to create a new form of the cambrian explosion in which it could give massive new design patterns in this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re in the next 40 years of nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context : i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet are in the world for every one of the year , in 40 years , and it &apos;s going to be four .
we have problems with food , fresh water , clean water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
it will provide a challenge for 9 .
we need about five billion tons of coal , and we need a hundred million barrels of water , and that &apos;s a hundred million barrels per day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace it , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 of this material moving in the atmosphere .
we now have the whole world from the world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the most important of the future .
the most important thing had a dozen components and see the diversity of that coming out of it .
we &apos;re very first at the first line of the biological reality and the idea of the idea .
we have technology today because of this fast double , which is what we call the most powerful genetics .
we now have the ability to build a big robot that can make millions of chromosomes on the day .
if you imagine these 20 million different genes or to optimize these processes to make the fossil vaccines , or the drugs that are new vaccines , we can change with a little little team more molecular biology than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s just selection selection . we can go to the search of chemicals , production of chemicals , or the size of the chemicals .
this is a shot of a career that we &apos;re working on , which is actually where you &apos;re actually putting up and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how it &apos;s going to look like that , we know exactly how to look at the genetic code .
we &apos;re now focusing on fuels of the fourth generation .
they &apos;ve seen corn just what a bad experiment is .
we have fuel of the world &apos;s field and third generation , which are relatively soon coming up , and we &apos;re going to have a lot higher , like remoteness or different kinds of plastic types .
but , as we think , the only way of biology is a big impact without any more increase of food or the limitation of their availability , if we see co2 as the result , and we &apos;re working on cells that go to this path , and so
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first with the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways of doing it .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
he lives in the deep sea , about a mile , in almost a long time , in almost a fashion .
it shifts co2 in methane to use hydrogen as a source of hydrogen .
we study whether we can use carbon dioxide , which could just be brought into the carbon , which could be made to convert co2 into fuel , to drive this process .
within a short period of time , we think we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really -- the targets that we have , the targets of the entire junk industry , is exactly . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where else ? one more main person &apos;s energy .
but we &apos;re working on this right now , the same process for development to the development of vaccines .
you saw this year with flu , we &apos;re always a year back and have a dollar to have a dollar , if it &apos;s about the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by building vaccines in the brain .
this is what might be like the future , with changes , now , to be accelerating today , the most sophisticated , which is the more transmitted with synthetic bacteria , and maybe the most expensive .
we &apos;re in light years of improving people . our goal is that we have a chance to survive a long time to do that . thank you very much .
on the last ted conference , i was a introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain how the machine works .
so , it &apos;s like , and for all those who weren &apos;t there , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment that ever had been imagined -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions which existed less than a second second , and that &apos;s to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we take images of these robotic images in detectors .
i &apos;m working on this . he calls atlas detector -- 44 meters in the width , 22 meters in the diameter .
here &apos;s a spectacular picture of the atlas in the construction that you see the scale .
the next year , the machine went to the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it caused huge amounts of water in control .
it &apos;s a picture of the first time that the entire track of the lhc would put around the lhc , then , with a part of the lhc , to make a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this picture at the 10th of september , we knew that the machine works , what a big triumph is .
i don &apos;t know if this was the largest ted industry , or this , as someone went to visit the google side , and the front page was so found .
it means we reached a cultural impact next to the scientific effect .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires here -- this golden wires here .
these wires lead to the most profound , when the machine runs on the ground .
now , the engineers under you will look at them and say , &quot; no , no , you don &apos;t . that &apos;s a little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you cut it very far , you &apos;ll be called &quot; the very s . &quot;
so in minus awe degrees , colder than the space between stars , these wires can be able to maintain the tension .
in one of the connections between the other people in the lhc , there was a major one .
so , it &apos;s getting blood wires slightly and a sudden , very much electric resistance .
this was the result .
now , this is still amazing when you imagine that the magnet would weigh over 20 tons and move around 30 inches .
so we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to remove what we did .
we called it fresh , they &apos;re more skeptical .
they &apos;re all back to their way back to their path .
the lhc will be viable , the lhc will be viable .
we &apos;ll turn it into it , and we &apos;re going to collect the first data in june or july , and we &apos;re going to put our journey on to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in a way that accidents are about the value of science and engineering on the borders of science , it &apos;s easy to reject something .
i think that &apos;s so hard that it &apos;s so hard to reach the fact that we &apos;re going to reach beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my final address to words of english , and i &apos;m going to leave you with a new scientist , and i think , as i suspect , as he was designing the most sophisticated experiments of his brain &apos;s brain , his apprentice was
thank you .
i &apos;m a writer .
and i think books are my job , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big life , lifelong love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that that ever will change .
but the recent thing is a strange thing in my life , and my career has happened to do that , which is to rethink my sense of work .
this strange event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography of a biography called the &quot; aw &quot; -- a biography of mine , love , and they decided that they were going to go out of the world and a big , more powerful , international
the result is that i don &apos;t care where i &apos;m going to be treated as if i was going to be the end of the line .
seriously -- the wind &apos;s collapse !
for example , you come to me , and say , &quot; fear you don &apos;t know that you &apos;re never going to be approved ?
don &apos;t you fear that you &apos;re going to make your whole life and never make a book that anyone in the world are interested in ? never ?
okay , that really makes courage .
but it would be worse if i didn &apos;t remember that i was in front of 20 years ago when i first told you that i was a writer , i was told to be a little bit of the same kind of thinking of the same kind of animal
people said , &quot; did you have no fear of success , never succeed ?
did you have no fear that you kill a letter of a letter of a letter ?
have you no fear that you have this craft , and never come out of it , and you &apos;re going to die on a top of a car service -- filled your mouth with the bitter ashes of failure ?
that &apos;s about how you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : yes , yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i had always been .
and i &apos;m afraid of fear that nobody would give a vote .
as algae -- and other things are scary things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about it , and i ask myself , why ?
is that reasonable ?
is it logical that someone should be expected to do that , who &apos;s going to be afraid of doing it ?
and what &apos;s going on with the creative enterprise is that you &apos;re insecure about the mutual state of state -- in a way that other professions don &apos;t do ?
my father , for example , was chemists and i can &apos;t remember a chemist in his 40 years as a chemist he was asked to be afraid of being chemists .
with your favorite , john -- how about it ?
did it just not come before you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not given the reputation of the last of the people who are getting the call from the u.s.
we &apos;re inventing this kind of call , but not only the writers , but the creative of all the metaphorical , seem to be this call , mentally unstable .
everything you need to do is look at the bitter , very great head of really great , and often the young hand , who died , and often from their hand .
and even the ones that don &apos;t really have been working on their talent was really neglected by their talent .
norman carter &apos;s just said to his death in his last interview : &quot; every one of my books has killed me a little bit more . &quot;
a remarkably extraordinary statement that you can do about your life .
but we &apos;re not even a little bit of the time when we hear somebody like this , because we know this kind of speech since so long , we have the notion of the notion and collective accepted that creativity and suffering , naturally , is linked to the
the question i want to ask today is , is this idea for you , is this idea for you ?
do you feel like this ? because with only one centimeter , i &apos;m not sure i probably don &apos;t think about this notion .
i think they &apos;re doing the main thing .
and i find them dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how they get taken next century .
i find it better if we encourage our great creative commitment .
and i definitely know that it &apos;s for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start this dark path of the estimation , especially in the fact that i &apos;m in my career right now .
this is -- you see , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have another 40 to me in my mind .
and it &apos;s very likely that everything i &apos;m going to write from now is the world that &apos;s going to be the work of the day of the day of my last book , right ?
i say it &apos;s a little bit of the way that we &apos;re all kind of friends -- it &apos;s probably more likely to say that my biggest success behind me is .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
these are the kind of thought that someone can get to the day to take nine o &apos;clock in the morning , and that &apos;s what i don &apos;t want .
i would rather keep doing this work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
after a while of the most popular , i seems to think that i can continue writing , a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind
somehow , i have to find a way of writing , to write a safe distance , to the real , very natural , and very natural , and very natural , as the reaction is going to be on the writing .
while i &apos;ve been looking for models of models , i &apos;ve been looking for the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they might be better or more or more of them than we could help with creative risks , which are connected
this quest led me to the old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will end up again .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity is coming from people , okay ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of malignant , which was from a distant , unknown source to people coming up -- from the most violent , unknown reasons .
the greeks called these divine folk centers of creativity , the divine runner .
from socrates , he &apos;s known that he believed he had a sign of a day that he was going to know him from further away .
the roman had the same idea , called this kind of kind of of engineering creative mind , a little genius of a genius .
this is great . the roman thought didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical infinite creature , which was thought that it was literally in the walls of a brain -- like the kind of thing that &apos;s like the sun &apos;s -- the most powerful and the artists in the work of work
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s this , because it &apos;s a distance that i talked about -- the psychological construction building , which protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked like this , right ?
the artist of the world &apos;s book was protected , like , for example , too much introverted , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you didn &apos;t look at all of you , and everyone knew you had this kind of thing that was going to have this kind of thing that you had , that was helped you .
if your work is going to work -- not entirely your fault , right ?
everybody knew your genius was a bit paralyzed .
so the people in the west have thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance came and changed everything . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- all the gods and mystery , and there &apos;s no room for the mystic creatures that
it &apos;s the beginning of the rational humanism and the people started to believe that creativity was completely from their individual individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people who are doing this or a genius , and instead of doing that , he has a genius .
i have to tell you : i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a naked person is going to think that he thinks he or she &apos;s like the pinnacle , how the abalone and the the sun and the source of all divine , is a little bit of responsibility to make it a little bit of
it &apos;s like asking someone to swallow the sun .
the pakistani and distorted whole egos , and it creates all these spectacle to success .
i think that this is the last 500 years that we &apos;ve been able to eliminate our artists for the last 500 years .
and , if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question : the question is .
can we change it ?
maybe to get the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative to return .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just eliminate the most rational grassland in 500 years , and maybe we can &apos;t just eliminate a little bit of a family in a single talk .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience who would be really projecting really , really , scientific doubt , to sign over the idea of -- basically -- -- -- -- -- -- the people who aspire to success and apply to their projects .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of them to this journey .
but the question i want to put is , why not ?
why not think about that ?
because it &apos;s just a lot of sense of how anything i &apos;ve heard about when it was about trying to explain the absolutely crazy thing that &apos;s the creative process of creative process .
a process that -- like every white , that ever tried to make something -- so in other words , everyone here -- not always always acts .
in fact , it can feel almost more sinister .
i had recently met a encounter as i was looking at the extraordinary american poet , which now is about 90 , which was the whole thing that was going on for 90 , and she told me that she was growing up and hear her , and he said
she said it would be like a train train from air .
the land on her would be on her .
she felt if it came , because it would bring the earth under her feet to the quake .
she knew she could only do one of these things , and that was -- in her words -- in her words -- the hell of the devil , like the devil .
she ran like the devil to the house , and she was following the poem , and it was just about it , and she was just getting enough to get a sheet of paper and a pen that she had to get when it was drawn through her ,
in other games , she was not quick enough . she ran and ran and ran , but she didn &apos;t get the poem through her and she &apos;d put it through her , and she said it would take a lot of land and she said it . she
and then there were these moments -- the part i &apos;m never going to forget -- she said that there were moments in which they had almost been given .
so , she goes to the house , and he looks for paper and the poem , and she &apos;s going to go through a pen just as it gets through her and then -- she said -- she was like this , she was going to grab her other
they got the poem on his tail , and it moved back into their body and took it on the sheet of paper .
and this opportunities came to the poem , and intact on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
when i heard that , i was sort of weird -- that &apos;s just how my creative process is going to happen .
this is not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel !
i &apos;m a computer scientist . i have to get up to work every day , and i &apos;ve got to sweat , and i &apos;m really uncomfortable , and really awkward .
but even i have a little complaint in my favorite room sometimes .
and i guess many of you have done that too .
even i had work or ideas that made out of a source through me , which i really can &apos;t identify .
what is this for a thing ?
and how do we get to the relationship with that without losing our minds , but even to keep ourselves in the opposite of mental health ?
for me , the best living example , as you can do this , is the musicians tom &apos;s musician , and i was allowed to interview him a few years ago for a magazine .
we talked about this topic , and you know what ? most of his life was tom &apos;s embodiment of the most powerful artist , who was trying to do this kind of thing that was trying to master and promote this , and with them .
but then he got older and quiet . he told me that he was going to go in los angeles , and it changed everything for him .
he went up with high speed as he suddenly hears a little fragment of a melody , which is how many times it &apos;s often difficult for him to be very difficult , and he wants to have it . he &apos;s not going to take it . he &apos;s
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he has no pen , he has no steering .
so he starts to get this old , old , and i &apos;ll go up with this thing , like a little bit of losing this thing , and will be held by this song on forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i &apos;m not going to do it .
but instead of panic , he just heard .
he finished all the time and did something completely new .
he just looked at the sky and said , &quot; well , sorry , can you not see me driving car ? &quot;
so , i &apos;m looking at this as i could just write a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a moment of a moment when i can take care of you .
if not , you know , there &apos;s somebody else .
go and roll leonard cohen .
his whole desktop has changed after that .
not the work itself . it was often so dark as ever as ever as ever .
but the process and the heavy , the heavy , the very heavy , was no one of the things that he did , and he was going to leave it out as a kind of trouble , where he was going to go and left it , where he
it could be a strange , surprising , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the old , physical thing that wasn &apos;t quite tom .
when i heard this story , it also changed a little bit like i worked and it has already saved me .
this idea of being saved as i was in the middle of the middle of the world &apos;s book , and i was in the middle of the world &apos;s book , and i fell in one of these these these these these these these these these these these these
not only bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just be able to do this project .
but then i remembered how tom was talking to the free sky , and i tried it .
so i took my view from the manuscript and i talked to my comment towards a blank corner of the room .
i was talking to you , &quot; listen , you know , you know , you and i know both , if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely my fault , right ?
because you see that i &apos;m all , what i have , invest . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you have to stand up here and follow your percentage of agreement .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , the hell .
i &apos;ll continue writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i want to give you a minute that i was here today for my part of the jobs .
because ... at the end , it &apos;s like following , centuries ago , in the deserts of the world , to be able to get more to holy dances and music , who were born hours -- until dawn .
these fixed were always great , because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but again , again , very rare , something special happened . one of the actors was actually a really important thing .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve all seen a performance in your life .
it was as if the time was a little bit of time and the dancers are going through a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind
and suddenly , he didn &apos;t come in more human .
it was light in the light and it &apos;s light up and everything is shining through an infinite fire .
when i was doing something that was happening , people knew what it was . they called it the name of his name .
they put hands together and started singing : &quot; aw castro , &quot; rabbits , swahili , god , god , god .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
interesting historic , in the process , when the u.s. war was moved to the air , they were doing this practice . the ambulance changed in the course of the centuries of the sun &apos;s rabbit , rabbits , rabbits , rabbits , the water , the most powerful
if an artist in spain is something an educational thing , something magical did : the rabbit , the rabbit , the news , the news , the great , wonderful , did it , and it &apos;s a glimpse of god , because it &apos;s a glimpse of god
and that &apos;s great , because we need it .
but , the tricky part of the next morning , when the dancer wake itself up , and it &apos;s when it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock in a tuesday -- and he doesn &apos;t have a more mature person in a tuesday .
he &apos;s just an aging school program with a football knee , and maybe he will never get back to those heights .
and maybe never will anyone call god &apos;s name , if he turns out . but what do he do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most profound of the world &apos;s most creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of requests when they didn &apos;t believe that the most extraordinary aspects of their existence are coming .
if you may believe that you &apos;re a loan -- from a spectacular source for a kind of a human life that &apos;s passed on someone else , if you &apos;re done with it .
if we start thinking about this , it changes all this .
so i started thinking and i think that &apos;s how i work in the last months , while i was working on the book , which is soon coming -- when the dangerous , scary , very expected to be fooled by my favorite .
what i &apos;ve got to say is , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; i &apos;m not afraid . &quot;
not 0.1 .
just do your job .
it &apos;s still for your contribution to what he &apos;s going to be .
if your job is dancing , dance .
if the dumb divine genius , you &apos;re holding to the side , decides to show a kind of a bit of wonder of wonder by your effort , and then , you know , the kind of thing that &apos;s going to be a kind of wonder ?
and if not , dance is your dance .
and the pilot &apos;s favorite ! it &apos;s like this , for you , despite all .
i think i &apos;ve got this feeling , and i should be able to teach that .
and the point of happiness is , for you , for yourself , just for you , just for you to get the mere human love and the most powerful , for that .
thank you .
thank you .
the book !
last year , i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic , the arctic , which had been the size of nearly three million years of the size of the lower 48 states to cut down 40 percent .
but this doesn &apos;t push very much enough that &apos;s the seriousness of this particular problem , because it doesn &apos;t show the thickness of the ice .
in some sense , the arctic is the heart of the heart of our global health system .
it grows in winter and it gets drowned in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m showing you is a very , very much more powerful thing that happened in the last 25 years .
the most important thing is to put up with red .
as you can see , it grows on the dark blue , and this is the annual ice in winter ; it &apos;s the summer of the ice .
this is called the &quot; blood , five years old , &quot; or older , almost like blood , which is from the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s gone from here to here .
this is a problem that the warming is the frozen reason to go through the arctic ocean , where there &apos;s big amounts of carbon dioxide , which is , if it &apos;s going to be a , of microbes to methane .
compared to the whole amount of energy , the whole amount of energy in the atmosphere could double , if we cross this critical point .
now , in some flat lakes today in alaska , methane from itself is from the water .
professor &apos;s university professor walter der university in alaska was traveled to another flat lake last winter .
wow !
you &apos;re fine . the question is , how will we make it possible .
and one reason is , this enormous heat expands greenland from north .
this is a year of a year .
but the volume is much bigger than ever before .
this is the most popular river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the sea level rises through the sea level here , it &apos;s flowing into the ocean .
these rivers take rapidly .
the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest largest community on the planet .
last month researchers reported the entire continent now has an negative water problem .
and the most important thing that came across a few of the world &apos;s is particularly the melt .
this is the equivalent of 20 feet above , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the most profound , the top of the mountain , you see new lakes , which were a few years ago .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their arms data from this one .
in the andes , this glacier is the most powerful thing for this city .
the most sophisticated ones have expanded .
but if you &apos;re going to go , most of the water will go out of the water too .
in california , a 40 percent reduction of the sierra reduction was seen .
this is the most common thing .
and the predictions , how they read them , are serious .
these are the most powerful things that lead to a dramatic increase in fire .
and the disasters everywhere in the world have never been available and previously unprecedented , and before that .
four times in the last 30 years , like in the u.s. era of the 76 .
this is a completely unfair thing .
if you look at this in the historic context , you can see what it &apos;s like .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve been 70 million tons of co2 on co2 , and every 24 hours of co2 every day in the oceans .
look at the area of the eastern pacific , the american continent west and both of the indian national media fields , where there is a radical decline of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , next to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is burning fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most dramatic problem .
the united states is one of the two largest most largest , largest ones with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot of other things .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that were taken in the last few years , with some green alternatives that were proposed .
there &apos;s a political argument in our country .
and the most important one , and the most important dollar , a single dollar , last single day , spent a total of the last time to promote clean coal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
to go around christmas , at home at home , a billion tons of fuel .
they &apos;ve seen it in the news .
this is in our entire country of the u.s. economy of america .
this was about christmas .
one of the commercials of the most popular of the christmas was that christmas .
the most powerful thing is a very happy kid , happy kid .
there &apos;s a lot of it in skin and abundance in america , and it helps to grow our economy .
the most prolific , the most delicious thing is going to be cleaner every day .
he &apos;s affordable and more , and they &apos;re staying in loans and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful computer director is the ladder of the computer revolution .
let me tell you a very clear thing . al gore , nancy , jerry , you know , you don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for climate change has launched two campaigns .
this is one of them , part of their .
and we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
so we put it on the top of the top , a significant school system to put a significant design on the way to get the truth over coal .
the fact is , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it &apos;s still fine still .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
let &apos;s leave that up .
and it &apos;s a lot of coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean carbon model .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy .
but it &apos;s the sound of clean water .
and yet , the burning of coal one of the main principles is the world &apos;s most powerful clean , which you see here , everything changes .
look at it right now , this is the today , clean carbon dioxide .
finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge and our challenge of the national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that all these people are connecting is our dependence on our dependence on fuel fuels like dirty coal and oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free to get us out of this kind of space .
and the other one of the hundred percent of the clean electricity in the next 10 years is to be fresh within the next 10 years .
a plan , to bring america back to work , to make us safer and help stop the global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
and the american american is new . find out more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about a u.s. bank of america .
one of the fastest ways of making our dependence on ancient , dirty fuels that are poisoning our world , to reduce .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
new investments to create good jobs .
and it &apos;s a new way of taking place to america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to come far , go together . &quot;
we have to come far , and that &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start with you to ask the time of your childhood , when they played with the metal of the day .
while they realized how to transcend the hands and get the hands out , the most powerful and moving , they actually learned to do and understand problems through understanding and change information with understanding information and change .
the spatial thing is that it &apos;s deeply connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a scientist scientist , inspired by the kind of interaction with real objects -- with my favorite computer , and my colleagues , i started to wonder , i started asking myself : what if we were using computers , which is what if we could use computers ,
this question was so emotional that we decided to take the answer to the answer and we &apos;ve developed the answer .
and a second , a more interactive computer is a interactive computer in the size of a computer .
you can move with your hand , you can see each other , you can capture your movements and you have a screen and a computer camera .
much more importantly , are physically , why you can just reach it through the hands of hands and access to your hands .
and the most important one is an example of a new generation of design technology to manipulation digital data .
and if these tools are going to be physical and a conscious awareness for their movements , each other can see and reflect the line of our dna with them , then we can start to explore new and entertaining robotic devices .
i start with some simple examples .
this is a video project for the most popular , and if i put it in a direction , it &apos;s going to play video , and if i put it in the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other true .
so if i put them side-by-side , they get their interest .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the world , you can see that and you can get a little nervous .
and they &apos;re also feeling their movements and bend .
so a very interesting consequence of interactions that we started to recognize was that we could apply everyday gestures on data like color so that you can do this with liquid .
in this case , we have three main types of dna as a human being , and i can use it to put color in the middle of the middle , where they &apos;re going to be mixed .
if we &apos;re going to communicate it , we can do a little bit of a bit more sophisticated .
there &apos;s also some nice opportunities in education , like languages , math or corporate , where we give people the opportunity to give the fast trial and to see the results immediately .
here i am ... this is a fibonacci number that i &apos;m making with a simple kind of design .
this is a game with words that is a kind of mixture of the kind of mixture of the world and the kind of information .
basically , you get every round of every single time on every single time , and you &apos;re trying to make words , and you &apos;re trying to get words , they &apos;re tested by a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , again , it &apos;s been recycled and you have a new organizational and new opportunity to try .
thank you .
these are some kids who came on a trip on a trip to the media lab , and i could move it to it and take a video of it .
they really loved it .
an interesting fact at this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; form words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s another couple of people that test it .
this is our youngest twin , the last one on the right .
it turns out he wanted to just stack the top of the day .
so they were just more restrained .
this is an interactive model of this .
we wanted to develop a design system for a computer company .
that &apos;s cosmology .
he can bring new characters into the scene by putting the laser out of the table , which shows this character .
here he is going to make the sun .
the sun goes on .
now he &apos;s going to take a tractor into the scene .
the orange tractor .
good work ! yes !
by shaking the world &apos;s voice and she can put it on side and put the characters on it ...
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with open end and it can decide how to evolve .
flying cat .
the last example i &apos;ve been doing today , to show it is a very , very , a design project for a computer project that we &apos;ve developed recently , and in the most fundamental way , as a sound , the bass and the bass and drums .
each one has four different variations ; you can select which you want to use .
and you can put these sounds into the sequence that you can put in any pattern again .
and you &apos;re going to be a , by just holding a car tag on a car .
there are effects that can change live , like hall and filters .
you connect it with a certain note and then you shine it to the counter .
and then more esoteric effects like speed and volume that you &apos;re doing on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s see .
we start to put the data in two in two cases of the world &apos;s two and a row , and put it into a series of the voice , and add a little more of the voice .
now i add a bass on top .
now i &apos;m going to do something else to do it .
and now i &apos;ll hook up the filter with the drums , so i can control the effect of life .
i can accelerate the whole sequence by the speed of the pace , or another direction .
and now i &apos;ll hook up the filter with the bass , for something more expression .
i can turn the sequence to it while it &apos;s going .
so i don &apos;t have to plan it in the process , but it can improvise ; it &apos;s expanding , or more stable .
and finally , i can put the whole sequence by looking out the way to the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my desire is to develop new software tools that are better to fit the way our brains and bodies work .
and i had time to show you a part of this new kind of new design and some of the possibilities that we work on in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you on the way is that we &apos;re at the threshold of this new generation of design to the digital media , bringing the information into our world , which is our demands .
thank you .
i &apos;m happy to talk to you all .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;m glad i &apos;m there .
yeah , so what should be a big deal of ?
i have to start a little step at the time , and that &apos;s how it &apos;s been busy with modern molecular biology .
i study molecular biology and i &apos;ve been doing a couple of years of the ted project , and i &apos;ve been starting to do that because i just wanted to know , and it was also about doing it , and it was also what i wanted to do
that &apos;s my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter of the matter .
i think that biology in general now , so very generally , is talking about biotechnology , all you do , and it &apos;s a synthetic biology and so on .
extremely important , now , it &apos;s extremely important , and much more importantly , it will be a lot more important in the future .
there &apos;s so controversial things like this all these times , changing plants on the surface of the ocean .
there craig venter is now trying to make the difference , so that gas from algae .
there are also things that are totally in the day-to-day life , which is most people not consciously aware of the people who allow us to wash their bare degrees of laundry , are also genetically modified enzymes .
and the list can continue to go away from a distance .
and so from the interest of this , i &apos;m going to go on to this technology , i &apos;m going to keep on the street .
so what &apos;s a solar system now ?
most people know the most people from the world &apos;s book .
computers regenerate , and then it will always be like this in the media , yeah , the hackers are going to break somewhere and so on .
this is kind of sad for the most important , because it &apos;s not that what it actually does , which is what it actually is , and what &apos;s actually behind it .
and that &apos;s the most important thing that the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , started with a plastic , and it &apos;s also the internet .
and it &apos;s about a playful , creative , original way of solving a problem .
and the problem that is not just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can be just a more powerful thing to do , which is how things make a matter of things , and a single one , a question , is a
and it &apos;s been just a software , and it &apos;s been used in the world &apos;s office , and there &apos;s also a whole whole , and there &apos;s a whole whole kind of thing that &apos;s going to do with the whole kind of thing that &apos;s going
and now , even in terms of biology , and i want to do this metaphor that will be coming from synthetic biology , that biology is actually a very important code , because , the most important code is a abstract code , which is , it &apos;s not
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program and be able to program it , and so you can also find it , and i found that i &apos;m incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to go much deeper to get there .
this actually has only two eight really , really , eight , which is these networks .
there &apos;s a lot of nerve in the field of the switzerland , which is originally from switzerland , which is with europe and with cooperation in india , but in india , or active people everywhere in the world .
these are the more artistic records , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and in collaboration with scientists that are engaging with these technologies , and to make them work , and to process the creative , there &apos;s all sorts of things .
but it &apos;s actually about finding such a kind of a more powerful access to have a playful deal with it .
and then there &apos;s a huge envelope of the mold , and it &apos;s called the horizon .
this is from the most popular one that is actually a kind of forum , which is a kind of forum where you &apos;re going to realize and discuss online online .
they &apos;re a little bit more technical and a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a technical , and then they &apos;re also asking , yes , they &apos;re
and based on these networks that have been popular all the popular , wait so much , i think that a scene that i &apos;d like to be just like to make .
here in the picture , you see the most powerful , which is a , which is a kind of a school , so basically a kind of school , a private school , a private institution , where everybody can get .
children , old , all kinds of people go to this to be easily modified , they &apos;ve put a lab and look at what can you do when these miniature particles are on .
here &apos;s a group on the left , and the one group is called the , but it &apos;s already quite a long time .
it &apos;s longer than these other two networks .
and they also have a conversation in an artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , also also , and combine it in a pretty much more sophisticated way .
a group of ankara that i met a while ago , who have been a little bit of a time that would have a place that would just like to convey the public , which would be going to be in college , and they tried to explain that ,
and i have a lecture on the top of the other picture in copenhagen in the medical museum in a combination of a show .
and that &apos;s , yes , that &apos;s mostly a young man , but the only thing that &apos;s actually all common , is this fascination of technology .
and what you can do with that and also look at the society with it , and ask , okay , what do you know , what do you want to do with what you want to do with you , you &apos;re interested in doing this ?
so , okay , to regenerate biology now , you can somehow make material stuff .
you need biological materials , and you need to also need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
or , usually , in a lab , you know , that &apos;s kind of kind of like the kind of thing that &apos;s kind of more powerful , extremely expensive , extremely rich , very much , highly skilled , trained academics with a ph.d.
and our approach was to say , okay , that &apos;s actually true that you don &apos;t have to do that .
this is actually not necessary because every one of every middle-class people has actually evolved more technology than most of the most popular technologies that are really like this .
and the japanese , with this premise , with this premise , then , for example , is to put brian &apos;s daughter &apos;s , and then he was trying to put a laser game , and then , you know , it &apos;s a kind of a , and
so , every one that &apos;s already a soup of a soup that he has left to have been left , also made it happen .
i then tried to put this in my lab , a little bit more , and then i &apos;d bought myself so much as a little bit of a bit of a sign , and i tried to make a test , so that &apos;s a test , so it
now , that &apos;s not a joke that &apos;s really a joke .
here in the picture , you see the lab , in the lab , so that &apos;s a kind of a garage garage with whatever kind of stuff that has been in the university of the university , which has been a group of the college , a group in
and this is a very important thing that &apos;s mentioned , which is mentioned , and this is the kind of thing that &apos;s a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind
and yes , so you see it &apos;s relatively relatively relatively relatively relatively relatively relatively diverse , so there &apos;s a lot of people who do that alone , until the big large organizations , which are just more nuanced in the form of the form of life .
but always always the approach that it &apos;s going to be easy and accessible to it .
the first project we &apos;ve done as international group , as we &apos;re actually aware of ourselves , is , okay , there &apos;s a real scene , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re going online , and we know that people who are always talking about the
and then , from the u.n. , the founder of the founder , and i said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got to meet , even though , even though , and then we have two things organized , and then two points of things , and a little
and then , then , it &apos;s about , ok , who is , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to do , what do we want to do ?
and what are our values and what are our purposes , our foundation ?
and then we &apos;ve been working on a very high time .
this was quite intuitive , so everyone has just so his wishes , his and what it &apos;s going to stop , and then , what &apos;s going on .
and there , i think , is a very good code .
and we then have this , and that &apos;s not a literal sense , but that &apos;s just , i think , pretty well , to start to start to start to start to be pretty good , people are right .
and we even tried to bring that back into academic world , but it &apos;s kind of not that way .
so i think we &apos;re in the way that we &apos;re in the way that the academic world is even more than the academic world .
yes , what do we do now for projects ?
a project i did with the radio in switzerland , was that we wanted to create a so-called optical case or optical tweezer .
this is , if you focus a laser beam , you can put little particles in the air , and you can put little particles in the air , and then in the liquid and then moving into this focus , so that &apos;s the way that such a kind
this really works , and it &apos;s done in academic geographic , and we thought , &quot; well , we might have taken the time , then we took a webcam , the most powerful , the lens , the lens , the lens , which is light , which
this is what you see down there .
and then we have a laser vessel , and we put the laser out and then it tries to focus on this camera there .
and unfortunately , it doesn &apos;t work , but we &apos;ve learned a lot about it .
so another project that from the french group there from paris , that worked , is pretty cool .
and that &apos;s what he does , so a kind of a , like , a kind of a , so , a kind of a , so , as a result , so it &apos;s been a little bit of a game , his family &apos;s job , his
he then built this helmet that built this helmet , and in cooperation with the museum , it was gone .
and then there were the visitors in the room in the room , putting on this chair , put this helmet .
then their brainwaves were measured , and depending on what they thought or how they thought , they &apos;re different lights in the room .
it was a pretty nice project .
another thing from the united states , which is also with this kind of metal , is that the most important thing is that the kind of thing that &apos;s been , is the kind of fun , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about copying genes , to reproduce , to reproduce , to reproduce , to reproduce , so you can make it visible .
so if i do that now , the most sophisticated string of crime , then go , collect any of the world &apos;s hands , and then you &apos;ll make these approaches to this method , and then you can say , okay , this hair is going to be
and the machines that make something that are pretty expensive is that they buy commercial , the cheapest ones go to the top of the barrel .
and that &apos;s not a really cool technology , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also do a lot of it .
so that &apos;s just a lot of a lot of the people you can do with it .
and they have two two warriors , and they said , &quot; okay , we &apos;re going to do more and cheaper , and then we have open source , so free source , &quot; free source , it &apos;s going to be free , and now we have the
i think that &apos;s kind of like six hundred dollars or something .
but anyway , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s certainly in a frame where it &apos;s more likely to be available .
so , it &apos;s my opinion of a very , very sophisticated hack .
a project i started to start with was a design of a project .
and so , yes , it &apos;s like a kind of a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of
you invites the most of the time to be on the top of the bed and the most powerful , and then i &apos;ve got the fuck on a pin and then put the light on it , and then i put it up to the light .
so the device you see there is not working .
but this is my prototype , but it was pretty wild , so that was a branch of the thing that the thing on the top , electronics , and it was the pressure , and that was the pressure , but it was the pressure .
and then i took a laser camera and i &apos;ve been involved in this .
a more powerful , if you &apos;re doing the full power with water , the enough pressure , so i think so 40 to the bar of it .
and then you can accelerate the particles , and then you can go up and go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about the most prolific euros or something like this , and the 50 , the 50 .
so it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically feasible .
so , this is the moment that you &apos;re in the moment that the core of the scene is just going to increase the core of the scene , and also increase the information and the information and the most powerful people that can be able to get there .
because , as the beginning said , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have a relatively little idea of it , and also no chance of making it really good .
because if you &apos;re just reading about it , from the phone , it &apos;s not the same thing that if you &apos;ve done it yourself or you &apos;ve seen it .
and i think technology is always becoming more important in our modern societies .
and if you can also make a professional citizen , as a successful citizen in society , and you can get to join , you need access to knowledge and to technology .
and you have to do it , and understand it , and understand it .
and then the most powerful open open open open and citizen science system .
so , you know , as citizens , you can get into the situation , just to be able to make these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s the core core of the brain .
these are the people who have at least officially officially put on the website , the website website .
this is a relatively remarkable number of people worldwide .
and interesting also , they &apos;re also taking in southeast asia .
that &apos;s me thinking that there are fewer people being put up there than actually exist .
so i know about some who don &apos;t have a head .
and these are just the hottest , the individual people .
and in part , with these miniature , these places put together .
and that &apos;s really in the beginning .
and as i said , it &apos;s just started .
and so , the most important thing , the most popular , the most popular , the first thing in berlin was the first one .
and this is a gigantic network of very good , yes , and it &apos;s been a very good , and it &apos;s all that you have in the world .
and we hope we &apos;re going to be able to spread and be more accurate , and also , as well as we &apos;re going to be able to do it , so that you can get more people involved .
and i would invite everybody to engage with it and also try to do whatever .
it &apos;s not so simple now , but it &apos;s not impossible if you have enough curiosity and you get enough energy , you get there .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hello .
how do we work in people ?
this is a question that &apos;s very moving to me as a designer , but also in the field of the brain , and all of the things in the field of user care .
it &apos;s about how to walk into interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and create them as a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a product experience .
because i think that the interactive media in us , cognitive models , are so on the paradigm , which is in our biological memory very , very long time , and that we can actually create the only by interactive media .
and this is very amazing because you think that these are the most powerful , that you &apos;re going to get there , that you &apos;re actually going to get the future , but actually it &apos;s that the future is exactly at us , in our own way .
what are the really important models now ?
i &apos;ve been recording four more and a half years of writing , and i want to explain to you briefly .
to be more cognitive models and that &apos;s the models that we have traditionally , we have more sophisticated .
to these very basic models , we &apos;ve been looking at a natural relationship in virtuality .
so that sounds like a strange thing .
but i &apos;m going to go back to this , but you &apos;ll prove to prove that you have a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second aspect is that since this kind of technology models are really capable of being able to speak very , very , very , very fundamental , even though we &apos;re using a language language .
and the third area , actually , is that it &apos;s actually going to explain itself .
we all know that the interactive media by definition is the most consistent thing that contains the denial of the air , and what of course tells us that we &apos;re thinking that we &apos;re thinking about the acoustic way of normal .
the fourth point is that the story of the story is a place of the world .
now , as it is with virtuality , which is actually the most natural thing in the world .
i want to prove you to that .
how many doors have the house where they live ?
we can &apos;t answer them immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s happening right now .
they go through the spirit of this house , in the blink of the house , and they look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what they do .
they &apos;re the reality of the reality , and they &apos;re very passionate .
fantastic , right ?
and there we are going to be concerned about the most powerful of the virtual reality in our perceptual culture , and we can actually do that all the time .
and this wealth that the virtual reality of the reality has needed to be able to do the people in the pre-industrial times , because they had nothing .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any more powerful .
they had no media mass .
the only thing that had happened was her head .
and in this head , the memory was going .
in this head , i was going to know , and with this virtual images , the imagination , the imagination was also passed out .
and so it &apos;s also so strong in us that we can deal with virtuality so well .
the interesting thing about this is , if i can make a little trip on this .
yeah , that &apos;s what it goes .
the interesting thing about this is that at the same time , the human being was at the same time and medium itself .
now , if you think about a little bit of a bit .
what are media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s been a change .
but i &apos;m going to talk about that again .
the fundamental tool of the world &apos;s brain has been for a while .
and the preacher , priests , so-called , they were more intimidating to preserve knowledge in stories .
and we &apos;re still going to be very , very strong stories .
the author of the book the book of the book , jonathan buffett , after all , we still have a year of the year of stories with stories of stories .
this means for a child that &apos;s been able to reach the most of the time of the most of his life with the most of his life .
now we think our love to get on the way that we were sitting in the lap of our parents .
no , no , it &apos;s very missing .
this is a lot more back , in the eastern world of the pre-industrial times .
but for me , in the field of interactive media as particularly impressive , we have to redefine that we have a se in biological memory , the ability to think of the ability to think .
i brought them an example of the north american tribe of the u.s.
and the life lived in the most british university of british columbia .
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very powerful area , and you had to navigate that way , from island to island , to get food .
and they did this with so-called &quot; the &quot; i. &quot;
you may have already known , if you &apos;re interested in the australian american world .
these are similar principles .
they don &apos;t have a throwaway , but they used the same as they were using the same as they did .
and what the interesting thing about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be photographed by songs .
and the language of the language was reflected by the language of the language .
that means you &apos;re going to be a little bit of sound about sound and about rhythm .
and these sounds and this rhythm have the geology , the topography of a region , and that has also enabled that you could actually get these songs out and put them in other places , and then move back to the left , and then move back to the
why don &apos;t we sing to get from a top to b ?
anyway , to navigate .
what &apos;s happening in this ?
this is what happens to the machine machine .
we &apos;ve been moving on the so-called so-called &quot; the way we call it . &quot;
and the machine &apos;s machine is happening , and it &apos;s the book , and it &apos;s the book .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we have responsibility for our memories and the human production of our individual memories of the individual media .
on the book , and on the picture .
so we unfortunately have a piece of god to be able to get a lot of the time .
virtuality has suddenly become alien for us , and it has nothing to do with the reality of the reality .
bruce brown , a well-known video of the world &apos;s book , is so far to say that this mass mass , he means the book , and the image , so not television , the internet , and so on , the internet , which we have as a
let &apos;s make a little baby chip .
the machine &apos;s machine for the machine .
what has the damage to our thinking and our memory system ?
then the most important thing is the main thing that &apos;s the pre-industrial civilization .
and they &apos;re over the course of the centuries of the centuries , and more and more of the things that are been done in the world &apos;s impacts .
and that means we have the ability to remember the potential , far common , highly common patterns of memories that we can depend on our personal memories .
we &apos;re not producing more ourselves .
we have an abstract language a language .
we don &apos;t think of the thing anymore in images that are not in pictures of images , but we &apos;re going to do it in our language .
we &apos;ve been used to that things happen linear .
and we have the comfort as a law , and there are only exceptions , like the most popular .
what &apos;s left us is the most important thing .
still , we &apos;re the most prolific than a very , very strong , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
we had the most salient thing we had , we had the machine machine and we &apos;re going to go up and go to this called the so-called &quot; aw . &quot;
it sounds very fashionable and it sounds very much like science fiction , i know .
but these concepts of the design of the world that we get to find these possibilities back to our capabilities .
it &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about the world &apos;s sake , it &apos;s about the world &apos;s sake .
i want to explain a little bit about this .
there are technical concepts like augmented reality , which means that the extended reality .
so if you look at google , for example , then you have a concept of what the virtual world is going to combine with the real world that is called our astronauts to the real world , the virtual than something normal , natural natural , and it &apos;s
another example is the so-called reality .
so crazy , of course , in the context of my talk may sound , because we &apos;re moving physically in not existing , virtual worlds , all the way to the model of the brain .
and other examples are the most powerful , smart systems .
these are spaces that can respond to the smart ones .
all this needs the ability to make our basic ability to visualize virtuality as a real habitat .
i &apos;ve been hoping , and i hope that video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the most powerful , the most powerful , the most powerful , and the most powerful , and the most powerful , and the most powerful , and the
and the two of these are also here today .
you might just stand up to get up to the end of the project , so you can get to the end of the project .
and this project , i brought up as an example , as a result of this sort of thing , cognitive models .
the whole thing is , i have to say , &quot; i have to say . &quot;
what the hell of course is extremely highly competent and it &apos;s a computer game .
and if i say computer games , you probably have a lot of eyes , that some people have people in front of any other passing cell or they &apos;re playing with some of the things that they &apos;re playing in the hand .
anyway , that they do that in the same .
this is a game for outside .
and that &apos;s looking at that , that i discover the outside world , so i discover the real world again .
and this game connects the virtual world , so the data that we produce is the real world .
i apologize to that i have to be summarized so much .
you can explain a lot better , because there &apos;s more than that .
and that &apos;s about that i discover a city by looking at what places that are positive or negative .
and so i get a whole different view of the city , which is a very different impression , which i see negative and positive zones of city and getting this kind of thing , and it &apos;s a very different virtual city .
and we can look at this now .
ah , what you can see here is a little explanation of what you &apos;re seeing right now .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , right ?
and with a kind of a flashlight , we can make this virtual worlds .
so , i &apos;d like to summarize my talk , and that &apos;s the sense that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve been buying from the metal system , and that &apos;s a little bit of a bit of a bit of a sudden , which is the
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very excited to be with you .
i &apos;ve been asked to be asked if this bag is a bag of a bag and i &apos;m going to talk to you instead .
it won &apos;t do it .
i &apos;m also going to repeat what &apos;s inside .
but i just do it as a little bit more curious .
yes , kids are curious from nature or should be curious , designers too .
i &apos;m a creator of house , so i &apos;m also passionate about the subject of curiosity and how the curiosity we might have , and why we might be curiosity , and why we might have to be curiosity and have to be more curiosity and so on .
this is a whole range of things that you &apos;re doing next to the actual existence as a designer .
if professors are curious , they &apos;re often going to be in such an n .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half year .
a key model for natural users interface is design .
now you &apos;re going to ask questions why the whole creators are starting to start with so natural , more precise , interaction expressions of communication , interaction and so on .
and i just think of one of these little devices , because things should always be more intuitive , increasingly natural , more natural , and you have to see what &apos;s actually true for us to see what &apos;s a human or intuitive .
and i &apos;ve been in natural users , and i have natural users to design the next generation in the relationship of human computers in the relationship of the human computer , how our tools are changing or how the computer is changing from computers to digital assistant .
so i &apos;ve been busy busy when , of course , what &apos;s intuitive or intuitive .
maybe again , a look at that .
why does this happen at all ?
so if we look at the development of our society , here &apos;s a short point , we &apos;re going to move from the third to the fourth , or the fourth .
so from modern , the world &apos;s population .
every society is shaped by a plastic system .
the first thing that the language is about is the language .
that means you &apos;ve found that you &apos;ve talked to a common language , you could communicate with each other , is in the same cave , or in other areas , cities , or villages , has come up with it , and it &apos;s kind of like it
but the most important thing was , the language , something very natural , something very much living .
you also have to learn , so no a toddler can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it , of course , and we &apos;re learning .
that &apos;s then reflected through the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
that was a very important thing that was a computer , because of course , the living language started to manifest the language of writing , which is what &apos;s called the &quot; what &apos;s the most powerful and alive , i start to start it and i &apos;m going
depending on how i &apos;m going to go and when i &apos;m going to go , of course , it &apos;s a very different narrative than if there &apos;s a living one .
but then , it was just a kind of the script that was going to be a design of the design , it got a place .
then the next generation , in which we &apos;re actually primarily primarily , is the most generally .
this is just the pressure and print of editing with itunes and other things .
it &apos;s the same thing that was the same as a result of the fact that the bloodshed , the other , and other people have said , are you really crazy when the people start reading , then they want to be able to get the other thing to
and now we come into the next generation and the exciting , so a very important one is all a few hundred years and we &apos;re really in this particular phase of this in this kind of space .
so , of course , confused us , because we see one side of the new media , the social media media , facebook , facebook and so on .
with the total transparency , what the new thinking is , what &apos;s going on on the old thinking , don &apos;t tell you that in the business community , it &apos;s not a coke , and no beef , or other phenomena , which i want to do is
and these two worlds just pop together , new and old thinking .
so the exciting thing is , if you look at this , these new society , these kind of plastic systems , the most powerful mechanisms , the principles of the world &apos;s brain , principles and the paradigm of the design .
but now , not more on local level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the subject of ecology is a global economy .
not if i think about the growth of the green and the neighbor thinks less green , it doesn &apos;t work all the time .
that means that the local village is actually a global village with the same principles , of course , so intuitive , but also the total transparency .
so as you knew in the village , who has what with who and when , this is what happens today , this expansion of our self through the mobile level of the world .
it &apos;s that we know global liberation and faster and more and more and more .
so it was just like this before the village was happening .
i &apos;ve been looking at the background of looking at what &apos;s called , because what &apos;s it that &apos;s still true for us , what &apos;s the case of what we might have , but what is the difference of the difference ?
because often , people can &apos;t get to it , so they can &apos;t do it for everybody to deal with it .
so you have to deal with what &apos;s called , and not just just changing it , but it &apos;s going to be better .
and when of course , when it &apos;s intuitive , and as i can do , i can make it influence and just make things like this , that they &apos;re a a a a a a a , very intuitive , so they &apos;re very intuitive , and they
you &apos;re going to be busy , as you know , in the academic rooms , with the perception of perception and the world &apos;s .
and that &apos;s of course , of course , what you start and look at and look , okay , so i &apos;m just looking at the inner self .
and what &apos;s it like in this ?
so how do we work if we &apos;re going to be there ?
and what does that mean , of course , intuitively and how do our channels work of perception and how does the cognitive processing work ?
because steve jobs once said , you know , you &apos;re going to dig up to dig up to your own , etc .
so you really have to look at the details , if i want to make something more intuitive or intuitive , which is that that &apos;s what &apos;s called the core .
and there you see that you have a our seven senses , most of the time we have five , now , we &apos;re already seven , since it &apos;s probably the next , eighth sense , and as an extension of our self .
and to look at how we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that is a difference .
many use the word , but not , but it &apos;s not what it &apos;s like to be very useful .
but i have to understand in the core , understanding the nature of the world when information becomes information , when data is going to be information and information , so i know how to do things as well as things as well as as well as things .
and of course , how design influence influence on perception .
we see this , if i design things , then i can make them confusing , like the right , where i don &apos;t know what is salt and pepper , or i can sort of make it intuitive by showing things .
so very much natural , in a crater , but i kind of see where salt and pepper is in there .
and if i say to someone , i &apos;ll give you salt or pepper , and then he &apos;s going to think about where it is in .
and the left , just intuitive and hopefully , i hope that no sugar is in there , the salt just just give up .
but also our perception , as it does , is how it &apos;s going to be .
for example , this perception in the context .
the right circle looks taller than the little , although it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re just very similar , and yet , our perception , depending on what context we do .
anybody know what that is ?
shekhar on .
it &apos;s a more important thing to do .
there &apos;s a little bit more to my glasses .
so it &apos;s the n circle .
a second circle starts to be able to get certain resemblance or associate .
and then if i &apos;ll go to a second , you can &apos;t see a little bit more , and then we don &apos;t even see a unit , circle and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see a unit , we don &apos;t see three
it &apos;s called a design of life , or it &apos;s a very simple thing that affects us in perception .
so important for the designers , they usually have the first semester , the great ted .
so , the way that we &apos;re going to go close to the continuity of the continuity and so forth .
and then , again , the third thing is forgotten .
but this is essential to a vital component , if you want to make things equally intuitive , as well as you &apos;re doing things .
the next phenomenon , which is very interesting , is the view of this .
so , sounds very banal , but it &apos;s very interesting , but it &apos;s partly exciting when you &apos;re going to be engaged with it .
so we have the front of the eyes , and now you think we &apos;re looking at the back of the front .
that &apos;s wrong .
you can see from the back to the front .
because they &apos;re a assumption to start that they see something that they see , which is what they recognize .
that means we &apos;re only beginning to see our own , before we see it , again , back to the back of our online , to say , okay , okay , okay .
i have this &quot; cognitive &quot; -- you have what you want to see , what you want to see .
so that &apos;s then there , that &apos;s coming back .
then again , it &apos;s going back to the beginning because the back of the beginning is not the beginning of the front , and says , now , you know , you &apos;re going to go and see , you know , what you &apos;re seeing , that &apos;s
and then again , again , again , and then it &apos;s going to be just a very little .
so a whole , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very much , is doing things like this .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s known from you this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve described .
now , everybody &apos;s trying to see this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who what recognizes .
does anybody see something special ?
a more powerful , right .
if i saw that , that &apos;s there that there &apos;s a kind of a force in there , you know that .
they &apos;re never going to forget about it , because i &apos;m going to show you where the most powerful thing is .
now you see the most salient thing .
and then , you see , you &apos;re always seeing it .
that means i actually stuck in the process of being stuck in the process that you don &apos;t recognize any pattern , but i have a little bit of the dog in a very short way , and again , this dog in this obscure picture .
and this is the projection of seeing the field of view , and it &apos;s a look at it .
now i know , i &apos;m going to see it , and i &apos;m going to see the same thing i see .
i see the most salient thing .
so , very exciting processes that then , in this , is , yes , it &apos;s not actually , but here &apos;s the kind of thing that &apos;s done in this kind of mass of mass .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know about it , it takes three seconds , until i &apos;m in the present , i can also be very good at the present , and i can also bridge very well in the way that i &apos;m going to do it with someone at three seconds
it &apos;s just going to be just as a present .
then it moves into the past and so i can be very elegant , for example , at the computer , when i know this phenomenon .
what does it take to get a lot of milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
it &apos;s a very exciting phenomenon .
this is the time that you &apos;re in love .
that means , consciously , if you know that , you look at that , you look at who you look at , because i don &apos;t get a gun for you , because i can &apos;t get a gun in which it can happen .
and a lot of milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time that most of the perceptions we have .
that means that the first impression is happening in a rapidly fast speed , as we perceive things .
and as we see things , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we &apos;re sort of pushing ourselves against our environment , so we can think about it .
of course , the creators don &apos;t just deal with perceptions and neural control or the brain models , but primarily with the subject of the world &apos;s brain .
so , as a human being , it &apos;s very similar to things .
there &apos;s a lot of things that are practical , so that &apos;s what the kind of things that we do is that they have the same thing that &apos;s happening .
there &apos;s a lot of time where i know exactly where i know where i &apos;m going .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why does anybody have a little bit of a small , very small , which is almost not what the most powerful thing is , so , as much as it is , it &apos;s not that practical ?
we &apos;re more symbolic , and we &apos;re actually on the top of the way that we &apos;re as a designer , of course , as a designer .
back to my actual topic of natural users , and the subject of what &apos;s natural , is the most powerful thing .
so , the way that i can do it is , as i can do , i can get a certain goal , or how can a user in a particular fashion model effectively , efficient and fragmented , and then get to a goal .
that &apos;s what the norm is saying .
how do i make something like that ?
i can use that right or i need to take it , or i need to make it an n for it .
and less , or more of the time , it &apos;s a lot of water .
that i &apos;m just doing that differently , and we &apos;re doing beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you have to understand that too .
and then , in part , when you &apos;re in part of the software that we &apos;ve seen , you &apos;ll understand , you know , why 99 percent of our software is intuitive or not to use the software of the software , which is the most intuitive thing
and so , intuitive , is not just an intuitive tool , just for apple , put in basic , and it &apos;s a fundamental thing , if i want to use technology to use the human devices .
why ?
because the rule of the new kind of energy , the natural user , is the natural user , for example , two times in the average of our goal .
you have to imagine that if you do something the classic thing , five hours need and with this new kind of natural software , only an hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you probably can go home four hours , but your employer will fall to whatever it is to do with the four hours .
but i want to say that , of course , it &apos;s a very important problem of course , to make some things .
so if we go back to the realm of software , here &apos;s the first of the first line of interface , the first one that were very abstract , where you have taken months to deal with these systems .
then the next one that &apos;s now made of neural neural model or mental model like the software is going to be working , which is , you have a notion of something that metaphor , the metaphor of a desktop , to make the computer translate .
so no longer zeros and ones or the code of code , but a metaphor .
it &apos;s been a lot of more important , but it &apos;s also a lot better .
the next generation of the conversation is very much more working with behavior .
so i &apos;m going to design a lot more often than a designer , as a designer .
this is also a paradigm paradigm .
so , i think that the appearance of the success is always the way that i &apos;m going to be a user , just the most sophisticated one .
and then if i go to this natural user , i &apos;m going to take a step at this natural user , where i &apos;m using a voice , by a bit of touch , by touch , by gesture and mouse , and not a mouse , and the
but also , that leads me to the point , when the things are the things that are more intuitive ?
if you &apos;re more intuitive and then i have to get my little friend to get ready and look at what &apos;s going on for the point of view of the world &apos;s brain , when is it really something more intuitive ?
and that &apos;s for us people , always , as i have to think about it , as i think about it .
so he seems to think , it &apos;s not like , but it just makes possible tools .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive it is .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
that means that if we can take a look at existing food systems from one on something else , for example , the metaphor can be done , i can do that as a designer .
that means i can just transmit an intuitive human health tool on a software and make the software much more powerful .
now , of course , the question is , what &apos;s the most important thing that &apos;s actually the most important thing that people and now have now been .
this is called the so-called hot .
and that &apos;s using each of us and the most sophisticated , and it &apos;s an acronym , and it stands for checks , and it &apos;s a lot of ultraviolet , memory .
and that &apos;s what everybody does , but it &apos;s doing it , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive and it &apos;s kind of instinctively , or partly , very instinctively .
the model is already going to be in the womb , and it &apos;s a lot of time , so it works in the world at young and old , and it &apos;s going to be used by us all the time without most people have ever known that this
and the point of research is about 50 to the most prolific time of the time , so in the sleep , you &apos;ve noticed that it &apos;s going to be less often more common than the day .
i can now take this mental pulse , and i can get a lot of mental health , and it &apos;s a social pulse , and it &apos;s a design of a design .
and through these kinds of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the world &apos;s metaphor , but now no longer a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a computer system , a computer system .
and this is on a higher grail of the world &apos;s population as the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the most of the world &apos;s population .
and if i &apos;m going to go to this , for example , i &apos;m going to put a lot of the time in the field , and i &apos;m going to be able to look at it in the case , and it &apos;s going to be big to
then i can transmit the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to do that by an example .
and all of a sudden , everybody has a cake .
and the point is , now i &apos;m interacting with the object , again , to zoom in , zoom in .
i &apos;m going to get the whole overview of this , now , filter and say , show me all the thing with chocolate .
and once , on a stage , what &apos;s much more intuitive and very much more natural .
because , i can reach the things like the bits , and it can come to me , and they &apos;re actually getting more natural than if about hierarchical organized websites or other mechanisms , and so they can make these things available .
imagination is more powerful , and with this sentence , i want to close to a and again , a and again , to give you a little bit of the evidence , and also , you know , designers have to think differently , to come to new solutions
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first , if you &apos;re going to be a kid , as baby , is that you &apos;re going to care about what the water &apos;s like you have , right ? and depending on whether your parents allowed them to play more or less in the back of
and the curiosity don &apos;t learn .
so all of that , these are all the ones that are here , and they &apos;re curious in fact , people who have a property that can &apos;t learn .
i &apos;m now about this whole thing , basically , this whole thing , the most unpredictable , 40 years of energy , to make it happen .
and there &apos;s a central point in this .
and that &apos;s phosphorus .
give up a chance .
they give them electricity on each day , and they have to take on two grams of phosphorus , and every day they have to take two grams phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could just glide as a representative of the plastic record through the air .
if we don &apos;t take phosphorus and make it happen .
amazingly , it &apos;s so , we &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a sense of what &apos;s actually a sense of course , but not that way .
because all of you talk about energy , but nobody talks about the most important thing .
the most critical thing is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we only have for two years of phosphorus , and now we &apos;ve got a lot more uranium in the world , much more uranium than being used in all nuclear plants .
in the last 20 years , there are major tons of uranium in our fields in germany .
and we take all this .
it makes leukemia in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for example , the environment , the environment , push less car .
the environment , make less waste .
the environment , the environment , is less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
this is like when i say , you know , i &apos;m going to get your child , blow it down three times instead of five times .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
if we think about the microstructure to the most of the earth , our whole earth will be used or later , or a cemetery .
that &apos;s why the patriot is going to be a beaver .
and the most important thing is to look at the ground as first .
in the ground , over 60 percent of the u.s. population is stored .
now , we &apos;re building corn and we &apos;re losing the ones between 11 and 30 pounds per hectare , or on the square feet , or also the square meters .
that means we lose about five times more than new ones than new ones .
we can of course look at the most sophisticated thing .
and it &apos;s all the packaging , or content .
for example , in the most contemporary 20 percent of the world &apos;s day , they &apos;re imposed in the most frequent journals of the world .
and because we become older , the ambulance is bigger .
this is all of them in the middle of the world .
yes ?
one baby needs about six thousand diapers .
we could reduce this for 10 percent , but what does this do ?
that &apos;s balanced in china in a second .
that &apos;s completely logical .
so the question is , how do we go with this feminist biomaterial ?
here &apos;s one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
i want to tell you .
because the phosphorus is being emitted in the pigs over the very aids components .
people about the urine .
yes .
so , there are men not to be pigs .
because this is what they &apos;re doing , right ?
traditionally , we think in the business industry , we &apos;re too many on the world .
and if you &apos;re the people who are looking at it , if you &apos;re going to be able to get it , if you say that , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re going to be in
and so someone like al gore says , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more sinister than the human population to stabilize .
in israel , you say , if you &apos;re living a human life , you &apos;re going to be the earth .
here it says , the more you &apos;re going to be a little bit more powerful , the better .
yes .
the first question is , are we really too many ?
if you look at ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants would weigh about four more than we are people .
i could also take termites , but in the united states , nobody likes termites , even though they &apos;re vegetarian .
that means the ants weigh a lot more than we do .
and because they &apos;re physically working much tougher than we and because they live only three or six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in the energy consumption , something 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too much , we &apos;re too stupid , yes ?
and where you see how far we &apos;re going to get away from what we really wanted to do and how sad we are , we &apos;re at all on earth , you can see that for example , you can see that there &apos;s a program , and you
you can only be more restrained if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you seen a little tree of a tree ?
yes ?
one ?
that means our whole intelligence means we want to be awake as a trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is a little bit of a tree .
luckily , don &apos;t , yes ?
there &apos;s no way to go to trees .
there are still six billion trees in the northeast of the northeast .
you &apos;ve heard about it from the trees of trees ?
that means all our intelligence means we want to be awake as a trees .
and where you see , even in something like a 747 , the most sensitive biological , agriculture , allows you to go back to our own business .
every year we lose three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go back in parts .
and so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s about it .
that &apos;s what we feel so guilty about the earth that we say , there &apos;s no no carbon , no more , no more powerful , no more , like you all , who will go back to our own poo .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less harmful , which is oil oil .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about having a big footprint that is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , it &apos;s not to be there , right ?
so , yes ?
you can only have a more sophisticated , if you &apos;re not there .
even if you shoot up now , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can do it differently .
we can take our nutrients back .
we &apos;re doing in brazil in brazil , where we are the nutrients back .
we can get nutrients in the way that we can get nutrients in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china for example , where we take the waste right now .
in china , a more powerful one today is still a little bit more skeptical , and it &apos;s like , yes ?
and in our western world , we were always too dumb , our nutrients .
that means that the western western field is that the city has always been taken , but the farmers never put something back .
and so the cities had to grow more , because farmers went into cities and they had to get the cities all the way away .
so all western rich are expanding , and it &apos;s more expanding until you haven &apos;t done the infrastructure and then you &apos;re the cassini .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve been able to get the civilization in five years of five years , because you &apos;ve always been able to bring nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to eat in china , you &apos;re expected to stay out of the food , until you &apos;re going to follow the toilet .
because it &apos;s misled , and you &apos;re going to take the nutrients .
you &apos;ve got them to eat them , not to the food .
that means you can see the internet , you can see the nutrients of your nutrients .
that &apos;s actually beautiful , if you do that , so agriculture makes , conductive , on a hectare of a country with five thousand people in favelas , can be able to grow a farmer , and the plant and the vegetables and the fish and the fish and
and the great thing about this is that the most important thing is the most important thing in the favelas around ninety percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control people , so little bad .
we can support them , good to be good .
this is of course , of course , but the facilities are wearing themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed by design , which is just a farmer that can just operate .
that means that the most important thing is going to go back .
and none of these facilities , we &apos;ve now built over the last 20 years , not from these facilities , ever ever been pulled out of these facilities .
they could just easily be able to get a liter of water and then it &apos;s ruined for years .
don &apos;t find .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people , so little bad .
we can support them , good to be good .
that means we need to have phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do what you want to do , you &apos;re in germany , in germany , the best is the best credit of the car users .
unfortunately , not in the field of music , but maybe you can help the most of the time in the world .
because the most important thing is the best that &apos;s the phosphorus .
and that has to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s not possible .
we &apos;ve been using this in holland now for three years .
the dutch government has explained , you will be the first country around the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need it all the time .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the world &apos;s population .
and then the opec is a bunch of a bunch of plastic .
these are the most pervasive countries that control 40 percent of the world &apos;s population .
and the oil will replace us by other energy systems .
but the phosphorus is not going to replace .
that &apos;s not about making the existing one of the existing , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and it &apos;s mostly asking questions about what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not efficiency .
in holland , you understand that easier because in holland , the country is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if you &apos;re sad for example , if you &apos;re upset , if you were upset , and you come to 50 more happy .
completely inefficient .
but really , really , right ?
or take a declaration of a declaration of a declaration .
a woman in germany eats about six different kilograms of three kilograms of life .
it &apos;s .
this isn &apos;t exactly scientifically accurate because we don &apos;t know how much more of the things that are going to be done .
but a foreign , even at this lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but very , really , right ?
it &apos;s all that &apos;s beautiful in life , not efficient .
that &apos;s why efficiency is not efficiency , but efficiency .
asking , what is the right ?
not to burn the most important thing , and it &apos;s going to be able to lose it and lose all the materials that are going to be able to lose all the materials for the census , but first to ask , how do you make the cycles ?
so , you know , mozart is efficient .
yes ?
if i put them on dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with a little bit of water and a glass of water .
wonderful , &apos; i ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything in life is beautiful , not efficient .
if you fall in love with somebody , efficiently ?
yes ?
that means everything in life counts , not to save it , to avoid reducing .
all the time .
we say the people , oh , you don &apos;t have green in the south .
no , the throw away is exactly the right thing , right ?
in every place , where you &apos;re going to be a , you know , you get back to the point of time .
but the wrong things .
if you &apos;re going to be the wrong things , you have a more mature .
we think of north .
there &apos;s all footprint on it .
if you walk , everybody &apos;s devastated the ground .
because the ground is going to die the mosses , and the wind and the water flows away .
but if you &apos;re in italy , everybody means footprint that are going to stand longer in the meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a big footprint that will be a mosh .
not the rest of it .
we &apos;re in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask them , how do you do this with your wife ?
what do you say ?
sustainable .
then i say , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to go , &quot; yes , yes ?
that &apos;s the minimum .
so not saving , clean , avoid avoid .
everyone is essential .
and it &apos;s a lust when you see in italy , like the people in the high bow , and it &apos;s like the car that &apos;s going to get out of the car .
because you know , this is a kind of a process of a process .
it &apos;s a form of the brain , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a design system that &apos;s in room temperature , which is a liquid .
you can throw it , where you go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re going to go all over .
and it contains seeds of rare plants so that they &apos;re contributing to biodiversity to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so it &apos;s going to get two cycles .
not all of that should be a host of time .
a television or a washing machine , they &apos;re just using it , they don &apos;t use it .
just the things that the most sophisticated , like the design of how to do , like , like , is that they have to go to biological systems .
things that are just used to be used in technical systems .
but today we &apos;re just talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the design of the day , yes ?
and it &apos;s very direct advertisements , and it &apos;s not for the company hugo , but that they &apos;re now helping this company to make these products successfully .
because we don &apos;t do things more free .
yes ?
so , if i put them up to food and say , that &apos;s free from the food , then you don &apos;t help anything .
no , we &apos;re stuck in what &apos;s inside .
positive .
so not like the brain .
not toxic in it .
it &apos;s all in the way that it &apos;s useful .
these are the first shoes you can put down the top of the mountain on the top of the mountain , and the rubber in biological settings can go , yes ?
all of it is a lantern of it .
and if it &apos;s possible , of course , we can do it for ceramics , for nike , for the consumer and the whole textile industry and the whole textile industry .
and that &apos;s half of the world &apos;s population that causes the textile industry to be caused by the textile industry .
so , you help that , you &apos;re asking people to go to people .
hey , hugo , does you really really seriously be serious ?
because they &apos;ve changed twice the most sophisticated .
and i &apos;m not sure that you really have a really good thing .
so , help me a little bit .
but it &apos;s .
yes .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been shown by what &apos;s been shown .
this is .
we can do things now that if you break it , if you break it , you can get in biological settings .
technical parts is just the same .
there &apos;s a direct amount of water that &apos;s going on .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , that &apos;s done in the circulation .
so , in every store , you can do things like this .
if you come on that , yes ?
do you remember the bloodshed ?
if it &apos;s the waste right now .
all over these are the specs around , almost .
in the countries where people come to money .
there &apos;s a way on the front of the road , but also in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastics , so it can go in biological systems , if we change the oil systems , they can go back to the ground , you can go back to a baby in israel , and in tunisia , they can plant trees in the countryside
yes ?
and if you take these baskets , they &apos;re picking it , aluminum and the powder , to plant trees .
so this is the baby &apos;s baby for all life , from the beginning .
so , we don &apos;t need to be more balanced , we can be more powerful .
it &apos;s kind of a more powerful print of print .
yeah , kind of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can even reinvent everything .
i started a institute .
now , there are many people working there with a lot of people , and they can all be engaged .
there &apos;s extra one of them to be able to get a group of life , where everybody can get to join .
so no longer save , clean , avoid , reduce , not a more powerful , but smart waste .
do you want to do that ?
thank you .
the work of the design .
music as a language .
in the description of my speech , i wrote that i as a design designer , as a result , as a result , so in english , in english .
and the english &apos;s poetry are the written notes in a very gentle music .
that you &apos;re not just talking about the word for word , and you can &apos;t just understand the word of the words , and also understand the word of words and the more profound , so that it has to be a useful translation , everybody who has to
already , from german to the english , more knowledge can require more knowledge , especially it &apos;s going to be about poetry or even poetry .
but it &apos;s an alien , but it &apos;s for emerging development , which we do with our own business .
as a master &apos;s , i first had the written notes .
you &apos;re sure that the composer in the notes has all been in the notes of everything that he &apos;d put in there .
in fact , the notes are very vague and advertisers .
these notes are about the same or the billboards , as a verbal , if also a kind of verbal , very seemingly , description of a landscape .
because in this verbal instruction , the smell of the flowers is not to smell the rise of the flowers , the degree of the world &apos;s rights , not to hear the most of the time .
that means the interpreter has to be a very important part of the world &apos;s brain , which is a different , which is a different , specialized , non-verbal , non-verbal , non-verbal .
today , i want to tell you what i &apos;m doing , which is , i mean , translate in a verbal language , and then you can see it in a verbal language .
so basically , an translation of translation .
so i &apos;m going to take it to the very best to german , because if i had to translate it into english , it would be easier for me to be in translation of translation of translation .
so the music is working for me as much as spoken language .
the most important notes of the letter has the function of the letters .
so it doesn &apos;t do just to learn grades and give the keys to the piano or the right place on a surface of a brain .
because that &apos;s just the letters that you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the point of the letters is you only see the language of the experience .
so , for the learning process , you need to be able to do the same as the spoken language of music at least as long as the spoken language .
there &apos;s also a fragmented , whether you &apos;re learning it for the most efficient , or you can also be active or you can also be active until the musical native native .
the work of the design is similar to how one of the most powerful things .
after first , one piece of play has chosen to play because you &apos;re excited about the emergence of the composition of the composition .
you collect information over the piece in the brain .
you read in the letters , you &apos;re reading , notes , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts of the composer itself .
you studied the works that he published before and later .
you &apos;re comparing .
the motives , to write it .
how did he feel like that ?
how were his circumstances , how the society and politics ?
all of this is interested in me .
you think in this time , by looking at contemporary images , or reading literature .
but with time , you also have a magic agent , but you also have a rich knowledge to play the composers you &apos;re playing over and feel easier to feel in it and feel it .
the composer is always becoming more to friend , which is where you live together .
his cause , to write the piece , is always becoming more and more of my personal concerns , playing it .
now , there &apos;s all the notes that the notes are like a very specific record of the message of the composers , but just a framework , i turn this framework to the point of making it sense and meaning .
i then say with my own words , what could be written between this framework .
i play the sound of what these sounds might have to do .
now for me , and for composers , and what they &apos;re now doing for him today .
every note , every phrase , is a sense of a sense because i feel it , because it &apos;s a personal way of getting out of my personal life .
it has to be in here and now , i can &apos;t convince my audience that i &apos;m not going to convince my audience .
it &apos;s always a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , that i &apos;ve been able to have a lot of the way to experience it as long as we can .
as you &apos;ve been to be a happy new day , even though with the same rituals of life , breakfast , breakfast , to work , i &apos;ve been doing the same piece of play , and i always get the same piece over again .
i &apos;ve become a day older , which is the seasons going down , my pulse goes down , and it goes down in a auditorium , it takes longer to return to the sound that the sound gets back back to home .
i &apos;m going to breathe the audience , true or unconscious .
all of that influenced me and all of that influenced my experience with the composition .
so , pretty wonderful , if i stand with a computer camera on stage and we have the same wavelength .
then the same thing happens in a good , more energetic conversation .
you bring a new idea in and in particular , this answer is with a response .
it &apos;s exciting , because things that we haven &apos;t practiced , and what you can &apos;t do is not have samples .
it makes great fun to make music , and as the audience has been , then you &apos;ve experienced how the music communicates alive .
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;ll never play more like this in this moment .
i can &apos;t play this as a 20 years .
there &apos;s more life of life than today , and i &apos;m going to have a lot more of the time of the world &apos;s brain , and that &apos;s where i have a lot more of the time of emotions and emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;ll have some more sophisticated things , but for new predators , it &apos;s going to be new to new predators .
have a nice particular example of this .
it was on a street for a comic party for the young teacher , professor , professor , a famous , famous , famous , vivid , long-term , long-term , long-term professor of the world &apos;s book in the wild .
unfortunately , i was still too young , so he was already a lot of time to study it when i finally started studying .
but i had the great fortune , it was very early , with 13 years , to meet and i was in my classes , and i was in my research for high school .
i was 17 , when i took back to a fellow , and i played the last of the four statements of chopin , a computer company .
he asked me what the introduction of this computer model was for me .
this is a very important part .
and in my favorite book , i said , &quot; expectation . &quot;
and he &apos;s like , &quot; and he said , &quot; so , right ?
this must be the most important thing .
because for me , she means memory .
he was over 60 .
well , with 17 , you have dreams , but no real memories .
i play the piece of all the few years , and i &apos;ve got it all over the time , even though not only changed a grade .
every time it &apos;s exciting , i &apos;ll read something new , and i &apos;ll read something new .
one of the other things that &apos;s done is a very different area . so , the most powerful thing has made the difference .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but at the other day , it &apos;s at the same time , in the light of light .
he &apos;s translated the most sophisticated water company , as he saw it , as she saw in this moment , looking at him .
his personal personal prize of the world &apos;s brain .
the most important interpretation of a piece is comparable .
now i &apos;m also older than chopin , as he wrote the piece .
he was only a few years ago .
and it &apos;s important to look at the notes , even though i mean , you can memorize it .
to keep the book , right with the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
especially when he died .
now , how do you start talking about the language of music ?
i said , you know , you need about the best of the spoken language .
often the most important thing is that you &apos;re learning the notes .
you &apos;re just learning to read the first one before you &apos;re just talking a word .
you learn to find the notes on the instrument on the instrument .
and if all the fingers in time and right , as it comes in the notes , they come out of sound , they come out of sound like music .
if that &apos;s accurate , the students get the most powerful piece on the ground .
it &apos;s not going to be talked about interpretation of the field .
well , there &apos;s a very rapid thing on the front , which is a quick piece .
so , it &apos;s slow .
according to the computer , f and b , etc .
that &apos;s what most people do .
but even though you put these together , it &apos;s still just something technical .
and it &apos;s not still a interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that often you &apos;re hearing something very much .
because , to make music on the instrument , the own musical and you should feel that it should be there before .
that &apos;s the singing .
a child that doesn &apos;t have learned that who didn &apos;t learn it , because it &apos;s not a lot of the time , it &apos;s not going to be done by itself .
this is like the computer model .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experience and the idea of music to then get it over another way , so to make a tool , to make it sound .
people who never said to you , have never felt immediately with their own body , like it &apos;s , a tone .
an explanation with your own breath .
so the music theory is the extension of our body .
our vocal vocal to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
so the piano is the the sultan of my finger .
the tune comes from the dance and the rhythm of the dance .
the continual color system today is not useful .
you don &apos;t need to make music even more if it becomes a boring .
not need to whistle a more , a more powerful way to sing .
every single music is going to be embedded if you &apos;re constantly going to be able to get out of the outside with music .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t sing ?
the question i can do is not sing , a , because you can &apos;t sing , you can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t learn to sing ?
in both of them , it &apos;s not too late to figure out whether they can &apos;t do it , or learn how to do these little muscles that the vocal implant , right ?
because that &apos;s what you can train .
or c , because you have it , you &apos;re going to be able to be a little bit of it .
and i wonder how to do this diagnosis of how competent competent was this diagnosis ?
have you been brought a little bit of a text or a more threatening , how do you tell it today ?
or d , you don &apos;t like music , and you don &apos;t want to do anything about it as well .
but what i &apos;d do , though , is that music is a beautiful , more powerful thing .
but maybe you can even do it even more .
well , you see , all of the cases , nobody has to be a single candidate .
but also , please don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand the classical music .
i can &apos;t say whether it &apos;s good or bad .
and i say , &quot; but surely , you can say , &quot; you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it &apos;s telling someone , i don &apos;t know if i can &apos;t cook , because i can &apos;t cook .
so , they don &apos;t get rid of the food , because they can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to get rid of classical music , because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen to it and say , &quot; you taste it , or not .
whether the music is to be too sweet or too sweet .
tell that what you feel .
and they also get the time , and they want to get some more spices there , or taste a little bit more spices .
now , why am i asking for my audience that it &apos;s also active ?
because the music is a language and a language is to communicate there .
a piece of artwork that you never look at is not to work .
the food that was used by a chef or a chef is being eaten , and not just looked at or just just or just looking at recipes .
so please hear if a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice thing .
if in a neighborhood where the adults are doing music or at least active music , a child grows , then it &apos;s easy for a drug company to ask , what color has your flower ?
can you play it in blue ?
and the kid is playing , after a red flower , rather than a red flower .
and this sounds very different than before .
and then this was the first beginning of a musical word .
so the first step to a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece today that has been originally written a hundred , two hundred or two hundred hundred years ago ?
now , the instruments have moved .
there was no piano in the way that there was a piano .
it wasn &apos;t yet invented .
i think the stream would have been thrilled if he had the verbal possibilities of the modern world &apos;s life .
i can now have the most sophisticated , which has the stream , which has a little bit of the way to make the sound of a mass , which can &apos;t be a viable ball of energy .
and also , beethoven knows that he heard more than he had ever been deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything that has been rejected by the orchestra as a result of the time .
so the composers are focused on us , and they &apos;re going to be able to reinvent the pieces again .
so they &apos;re being pirated , which they &apos;ve just imagined in the spirit .
and also , what you would think about today in mind .
or what i &apos;m doing today is because what you could have thought about .
thank you .
you know what is envy ?
were they once jealous ?
and how did that feel ?
suck .
i have a friend who drives a car service .
when i come to my little v , i &apos;m going to leave you with my little v , and i &apos;m going to get this feeling .
i &apos;m going to sing something through the head .
i say , &quot; what do you need to do this &quot; n big car ? &quot;
that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be the first year half of his value .
and at all , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to afford to do so much of the same car ?
and then immediately , i &apos;ll get a bit of it .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this awkward feeling is gone .
our organism has invented a great way of bringing such a little bit of emotion like envy .
you can also try that with words like revenge or or or or a lifetime .
i want to explain to you today with this mechanism , or something that is probably familiar with you .
the mechanism comes from lying .
but think about it , as you might have heard of it , if people say , nobody has to build the agenda .
and then they &apos;re going to rock up , so he &apos;s cutting the view .
so , in a lie , you see the liars don &apos;t believe what he says .
it makes a light easy to check out that it &apos;s got a very different sense of meaning .
he &apos;s just making it , and it &apos;s not itself .
no , the lie i &apos;m talking about , that &apos;s got to do it , that you &apos;re aiming at yourself .
they need this lie to get a more powerful , to get a dictator .
you can make it slightly easy , yes , or also , you can get down , or down .
they need time .
and this time , a anecdote talks about you , maybe you know .
the spanish painter , picasso once , has a woman &apos;s email .
this woman then complained that the portrait would not look like you .
picasso &apos;s saying , wait for just .
it &apos;s going to be more similar .
and in this place , and when you laugh , you see how important this lie is and how much time you need to learn something that artists can tell us .
because artists have a high proportion of proportion to lie .
the artist shares something with you , and especially this lady , which you don &apos;t see , if you just look at the mirror .
the artist shares you in a portrait of something that you &apos;re going to be familiar with when you &apos;re going to see this piece of artwork .
then this awkward sense , it may not be like you , and it &apos;s going to be more similar to you .
here you have this mechanism that we can use as a great invention to the kind of a great invention of our dna .
and not only in art , in the world &apos;s brain , in the mythology , in stories , it comes back .
you may know this idea of the lady , looking at everybody tomorrow in the mirror and asked him who is the most beautiful in the country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a little bit of a shark .
behind the seven mountains and so on .
and you also know how much hostility from this true appeal , the mirror can &apos;t lie , from that true appeal to that true appeal .
but we should just be familiar with that that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a little bit of a car in place .
here &apos;s it , what we &apos;re doing under the oil revolution , we &apos;re going to put it back over again .
we need this lie that we can preserve the delusion that we can &apos;t survive in .
we don &apos;t just have the art in the art , in the science community , but also in science , as well as this .
and there &apos;s this story of the woman &apos;s history of the computer &apos;s book .
she heard about this book from charles darwin , the emergence of the species and the full line of people .
that the man of the monkeys should , and , at least , there was a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then they ran them to their husband and said , &quot; well , that &apos;s not true what charles is writing .
the human being is supposed to have a common ancestor or a common ancestor .
no , no , it &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , we have to prevent that people are going to know about it .
why do we need to prevent people who know about something when it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live without those things .
because we , that sense , this sense , great to be , the amount of thing that &apos;s the highest thing , not by such a kind of such animal , is something like a organism that exists , and that &apos;s what &apos;s still like a organism that
so , we can &apos;t really be able to do these things .
we need to prevent people who are getting people to know things , especially when they &apos;re true .
so you see how slowly this mechanism develops and how the traces of the tracks that he leaves , which is going to leave you on something else than this great picture of ourselves , i want to illustrate you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , like i mean .
my wife told me it .
she came from school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told her a student .
a student student .
she likes to be particularly , because he &apos;s got a slope to the indifference .
and she asked him what are your hobbies ?
and he says , well , i &apos;m at the fire fire .
and because i &apos;m at the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in the kind of thing i &apos;m interested in .
yes , you &apos;re feeling it when you &apos;re fine at this point . there &apos;s something wrong .
i told my wife , whenever a human being in a moral twist , because it uses the design of the world , if we &apos;re going to try to replace it by replacing it through the computer .
and you &apos;ll do that once and then you experience the sentence .
although i &apos;m at the fire fire , i &apos;m interested in the things i &apos;m interested in .
they feel that it &apos;s the real truth behind what &apos;s happening .
so a little bit of a little bit of a dinosaur , it &apos;s not interested in the internet .
it &apos;s interested in the design of the world .
but there are no clubs that we can see around us where you learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only second second , the fire fire .
he was signed up .
and then , you know , you don &apos;t say his teacher , you don &apos;t like to be a fire , and you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a bit of a bit of a time , and that &apos;s when the fire after the fire
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re in charge of the dangers that are only going to be able to get the other , when they put fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this is the one that &apos;s going to be the middle of the world &apos;s brain that &apos;s been in the middle of the world &apos;s face , but that he &apos;s actually not going to say that .
here you have this kind of precious thing between the unconscious and the conscious , which immediately jumps down without doing something about it , and the things that you know about , you can look at it very differently , so that they can make a lot better for
so just as simple as these words we &apos;re using in the language of political accurate in the right of the correct space .
we actually know that something else is the case .
but we know if we call that the social dimension of the very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to do things like this in a society that is going to work .
so i want to tell you what we &apos;ve found in my institute .
after which logic that deception , the judge , the willingness to , a different reality than the ones we actually know in the unconscious , is to spread out of the way outside .
so i want to share with you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is , what many of you know , and some of you value , quite a few of you don &apos;t need to do it .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is something that is intellectual , says about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that doesn &apos;t make stop , of course , of some of the things that are not from stop .
and if you have people who are the most powerful belief , they have a soul , or you can also say that they &apos;ve been brought out of the soul to live , then they think about that as if the soul are so much of a mental framework
and so from that soul , you think that somehow they kind of in these wild nature , in this particular way , that nature is called the latin , the most powerful , present .
and when this kind of metal of the people are exposed to the people , it &apos;s filled with dignity , with the spirit , with nature that can only live , right with soul .
and then he can just be a trusted .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so , you want to go from the outside to the people .
so we should be able to perceive what &apos;s going to be present for our lives .
and if you have this premise of eyes , you understand the logic that we can experience , with a lie , to make our world better than a lie .
because now you can apply a more stable job .
you know , it &apos;s still from school .
this is a very important one here , which describes a logic .
this is the hardest part of the hardest part in my talk .
here you need some logic , but also the willingness to lie .
so to lie , it &apos;s just to be able to use this logic to be wrong .
in this case , three sentences come from .
the first sentence is , &quot; there &apos;s no soul . &quot;
so the second sentence is , if the first sentence is right , he doesn &apos;t have any soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i presented it in particular .
a third sentence , which immediately shows people , who have a strong sense of a soul .
they say who doesn &apos;t have any soul , who is dead and can &apos;t claim anything .
and here you &apos;re feeling .
here &apos;s the logic in this , yes , in this particular speech talk .
you see it immediately .
the first two sentences that are logical .
because i can say everything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any word about reality .
i can say , the most sophisticated is a man .
and if i have right , the most powerful one is a man .
if i don &apos;t have right , the most powerful man is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t make a clue about what &apos;s true .
i can say everything .
but it &apos;s important , if i have right , it &apos;s true .
so if the car is saying , there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he didn &apos;t have any soul .
these things are logical .
and now our evolutionary consciousness feels immediately , and you can do something .
it &apos;s a third sentence that doesn &apos;t have to do anything with the first two sentences and that is what is the opposite of the first sentence , and once it &apos;s accepted .
because actually , we have to prove if there &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that just uses it , that two sentences are correct , and a third of the brain sets , which looks like he could have done something with it , so we can save our food system .
so , we &apos;re doing that as if it &apos;s impossible to be able to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about this .
we can continue to continue these things in different examples .
in the present , we have a very modern example , which is always going to go back to the oil rate .
and you have to think about another philosophical topic , a more philosophical thing , present .
that &apos;s what we do to do that in the field of the century .
there was a scholars who was named johannes , and after that , the most harrowing 11-year-old named the &quot;
the most sacred psycho is a protestant , which is from pure nature .
it &apos;s not that soul .
this is a kind of a hot reactor .
and if you put the exact exact same in the middle of two , it &apos;s going to be a little bit more powerful .
because he doesn &apos;t know what a haystack should be doing first .
so he &apos;s in the middle .
so the most important thing is that the main movement is introduced .
and the power of the power of the sun &apos;s forces with the rest of the world &apos;s brain .
there &apos;s nothing happening there .
just if you take another example , so if you take a little larger , you don &apos;t need any reason and no reason to do anything .
automatically , he &apos;s going to be the right thought .
so if you have this idea that you get somehow driven by nature , it &apos;s going to be , you know , the bigger pile that you put in , you have a sense of the feeling that you have to get a free will .
and if we &apos;re in the most troubled of the world &apos;s brain , i remember the brain science project .
there &apos;s a scholars who &apos;s called the wolf , and it &apos;s sometimes telling you , wolf , the wolf , there &apos;s no free .
now we can put the second sentence , and we can say , if wolf has right , it &apos;s not going to have any free free .
these sentences are absolutely logical and accurate .
and what we &apos;re doing now is almost a daily age in the newspaper , and you can see that in this third sentence .
it looks like this , who doesn &apos;t have any free free , can &apos;t be pulled for its actions and claims of responsibility and it &apos;s so versatile .
and you have it again .
and actually , you have to prove to prove whether there &apos;s something like free .
but the logic of deception allows us to do this as if the first sentence of the beginning is wrong , when you have to take the opposite of the case without evidence .
and now you can just do something if you want to do anything , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , and you &apos;re looking for the audacity to lie to the lie .
so , for example , if you &apos;re going to meet a person that you can tell you , there &apos;s no more than a person .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for the most of the time that says , &quot; prophet . &quot;
you can &apos;t call that , that would be a little bit more politically organic .
say , there &apos;s no more sophisticated .
immediately you will be one , for granted , and you can &apos;t have a chance of that , you can &apos;t prove .
and you have a problem .
because while they &apos;re busy , they &apos;re not able to prove that they can &apos;t prove that there is no way there &apos;s no such man .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he &apos;s fooled .
because he &apos;s led to a red , he &apos;s not going to be able to get it down .
because actually , this person is not interested in evidence .
it &apos;s just interested in the need to be able to prove to yourself , to prove that there &apos;s a lot of time .
so , in the way of shifting the evidence of the mind , you &apos;re experiencing the brilliance of the lie .
and once you have a way to feel this kind of thing , that kind of thing that you do , you do it , because you &apos;re going to be happy , because you &apos;re going to be happy to remember it in your own way .
thank you for your attention .
yeah , good afternoon .
i &apos;ve asked myself to ask myself if i can tell you .
she &apos;s one of the most wonderful things that &apos;s done by this great event , and i asked myself if i got a talk and my idea of public advantage .
i have to say , you know , you &apos;ve got it , it &apos;s hard to talk to me about my idea .
and i may think maybe my favorite thing is that i &apos;m trying to introduce you to this .
but it &apos;s natural , of course , the sum of lots of ideas .
i &apos;m probably , the two nice girls still , i probably am in the generation that have this bad image of the image , because i &apos;ve been starting to study a lot of equipment in the field of engineering , technical college , today , and today ,
and i &apos;d come to berlin in the mid- &apos; 80s for berlin , because i wanted to make renewable energy and that &apos;s not in the center of the world .
there was the most profound thing .
the ones that were all the time , the most sophisticated , also meant the most powerful thing .
the hot today is the hot .
because a good engineer has either built a great car or a good engineer .
but what &apos;s like , like n , is the way that the n is coming out of the square square meter , which was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a crazy nut nut .
i &apos;m grateful to the ted project that he has the word again , because after the time , you had been able to use the word , because it was all the left , because everything left left was bad .
but that was not that in the world &apos;s book .
there was a lot of time that there was a lot of time , and one of them was just sitting in the prison room , where you thought evil .
the place of the computer , but that was the kind of thing that was made and the wind and the solar system and i started the mid- &apos; 80s .
and yes , a lot of what was said today , i touched me very , because many , many beautiful statements that i &apos;ve lived around .
i worked in the collective working for 11 years , which was a very talkative .
we were 20 people .
if one of the words was said , the most popular thing was , the most complete thing that has been done is a very hard thing , i &apos;ve been very hard for 10 years to do it , because i was really passionate about a very wonderful thing
it &apos;s busy with an excruciating .
and that was really , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very much in the place , just stepped down a picture , where i asked myself for 10 years , a
and i then have to go to the street and then we have with friends with friends , and then i &apos;ve become a canadian of the company that was then with the most powerful of the world &apos;s most powerful health system .
a more powerful , but also , of course , we have the problem of a growing company and we have a little group of time , and we have a small group , decided that we &apos;re going to start to go back and engage and engage the next
and i brought you a project that i want to introduce you to now .
and the title of the talk was , yes , you get to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started asking a relatively , very much more , very much a more sophisticated story , where you could make a memory today .
on this island , that &apos;s the island of the island of the sun .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there are four people living there .
now , you have an renewable policy system today from 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have more ?
it &apos;s just technological .
if you get more wind wind , the system starts to fail .
i also tell the politicians , if they &apos;re in the same way in the field of our facility .
so , the people say , why ?
we &apos;ve already got 20 percent in germany .
but no problem can be a problem .
but it &apos;s not true , we have seven percent and our network is physically seen the european .
if we had 20 percent in europe , we have had the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was simple , just , just , i think , was a little bit of the time , the first contacts of the island , but just just calculate through the island .
as big as big , because actually , a battery would be so that you have a island of a decade to 20 , 30 , 40 , maybe 70 percent renewable .
and yes , i go back to a slide .
the conventional system looks like this in the world .
by the way , a year of a year is filled on a hundred gigawatts of the world &apos;s electric performance on the world .
this is the performance of a hundred nuclear power power , because it &apos;s particularly fast everywhere .
the world &apos;s favorite world , the world &apos;s going to be deleted with abalone , because you don &apos;t need permission .
this is very quick .
you put it up as a box .
and then it looks like this .
in the most three of the world &apos;s life , three will always wait .
yeah , so this is what it looks like down there , the load .
we also have very precise data .
and the most important or the solar system or whatever it is is in the rule of a system , or a system , which is just in small quantities here .
our goal was to say it &apos;s okay .
the typewriter is going to be the sun and the wind , sun , the burden that you can map the larger percentage .
and if you want to go over 20 , 30 percent renewable energy , energy per year , not the performance in the moment , then you have to turn off the typewriter .
that means that the moment you have to worry about that is that renewables can take the whole net .
and of course , you can only get managed to get managed in some kind of way .
that &apos;s what nobody did in the world .
that &apos;s the little style , so you can also use your body phone on a little bit of a small car .
people always ask me what they &apos;re doing in the back of the world ?
that &apos;s already what it &apos;s going on .
but if you want to do multiple of these metal types , and you want to build a net , it will be extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to come to 70 to 40 percent renewable , and then there &apos;s still this rest that the last 10 , 20 percent renewable , that will be very , very expensive and that &apos;s not going to work that you &apos;re going
it &apos;s going to be a solar system that then , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you can see or sh , that will be it .
they have to go to a more sophisticated and not just balance and not just balance .
we just wanted to know what &apos;s a normal , scalable battery battery .
so how far is it coming ?
and then a whole bunch of simulations did .
and have wind and the sun and the burden of the sun came up and came to the outcome , a very exciting outcome that you &apos;re going to take over the conventional system that takes 20 cents a middle charge of about 50 cents a gallon .
these were the first calculations six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
and it &apos;s great , we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper as the most important thing that the average age is going to be going up five percent a year .
and then we started negotiating the plastic system .
what would all be done ?
have practiced with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new york .
we were only at the time , and we were just going to build a new way to build the society again .
and again , the picture .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green system is our system .
that our system also has a more powerful , and it &apos;s because we &apos;re doing 20 percent with petrol , and also a more powerful thing to do with the other things .
and the most popular thing that the most important thing that the most important thing is , we &apos;ve been doing it , we &apos;re really great .
we also want to support , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a hall in berlin , which we can sort of map the electric position of the island in the scale of the island .
that means we &apos;ve been looking for the largest battery of the world .
here she is .
it &apos;s completely coming from asia , in the case of japan .
and it &apos;s been in the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , in the &apos; 70s , developed today , developed , and then became a japanese , and then it became the japanese .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
she has an megawatts and can take six hours for a long time , and that &apos;s the battery that we have , sort of , a little bit of the time .
and then they set up .
we also have one of these most profound things in the same size , as he &apos;s putting in the hall to actually get the full dynamic behavior from this web , so in the hall , it &apos;s the most powerful battery that we can simulate , the whole
over here , we &apos;re doing the whole thing that &apos;s going on , the cable cables , the cable , to sort of represent the most powerful thing in the net .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we can also merge two kilowatts of whiskey on the web .
so here we see this again , again , the abalone , again , the whole , single type of energy .
and what we did since the time of the city was then finished , until today , the middle of the city , until today , was all the way between the individual system , to develop software , we did .
so we &apos;re not a social , but we define ourselves as a company that is only between the subject of battery and the subject of the web .
you have to communicate , of course , to communicate , you have to communicate in the net , you can also communicate in the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beauty is that you can basically take this island in the island of this island , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to get to think about when we want to increase our percentage of renewables .
so this whole discussion , as it gets , is going to go back and forth , and the way that you &apos;re going to do it , we have to have the island for example , for example , for example , for example , we have the wind
and then , it &apos;s going to give you a more powerful point .
so , a solar system , a very high school everywhere .
we can start to integrate on the island of the island , to integrate , in the island , because it &apos;s the burden of power .
that means if you &apos;re at 70 percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can go through &apos; n , you can go through nets , yes , you should do it on every case , the percentage of the board , but you never can get rid of memory .
and that &apos;s the message that &apos;s the message .
so , many people come and look at this , because you can see what problems you get .
if we turn off the typewriter , you don &apos;t have the spinning mass that causes a certain inertia of a certain inertia of the web .
and our main system is basically , in fact , from rotating quantities of large power power , where the wave all over europe is constantly spinning around europe .
we look at this web , and the 50 hertz , and if it &apos;s going to be nine hertz nine hertz , we start a few more cosmopolitan , and then we &apos;ll start a little bit of steam , then we &apos;ll get a little bit more open
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredible biomass .
if you go somewhere else , it &apos;s going to take you back .
the most important reserve that the carbon reserves have at least 10 seconds to keep the web stable .
and in time , they can respond to other things .
if you don &apos;t have that spinning , this spinning mass , then you have to replace it with a little bit of the time and the internet .
and we can once have this big battery two milliseconds of the time .
and then you see that there &apos;s enormous amounts of power there .
and the message is , we have to get rid of these rotating masses , when we &apos;re sort of our goals 20 , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 percent , 30 percent , and so on , if we want to reach the whole thing .
then we have to break our capacity into the net .
so , the power station is just , it &apos;s going to go to the power station to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a very simple thing in the moment , the first thing that &apos;s done , is the most important thing , because we don &apos;t otherwise , or a little , or not .
and we &apos;re just trying to make that that you can get the capacity to break the capacity to break away by the grid , and it can be edited into the grid .
and so , fortunately , there &apos;s a lot of studies now .
and then , to this purpose , people always come and look at our own , sort of , our favorite , sort of , our favorite .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , how far you can get a piece of the way that you can get a piece of life .
and many discussions that i had in the last six years , was similar to the discussion i had in the last 30 years , and i had the issue of whiskey .
not , is predictable , and we have all of us , and we never do it .
we have 30 gigawatts today in germany .
this is a video game .
and i just go from that , that we &apos;re going to spend the same capacity in the next 30 years to use the same capacity in the world &apos;s energy systems .
just just , it &apos;s going to come .
there will be a lot of data in the world and arguments .
the beauty is that i &apos;ve been in the last two years that scientists are going to be on my side .
we &apos;ve got over 10 million of these days , also , for a german network , to the german web .
this is going to happen in april in april .
so , from that , you also realize that there &apos;s a change there , and only from this 30-year orientation to the idea , to the idea , hundred percent renewable is true .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a solar system .
so , in discussions , they &apos;re always trying to do this , these kind of things that are doing , they have a little little net , which has nothing to do with our own .
the question is , if you &apos;re completely doing it , you &apos;re going to be completely independent from some fossil or more or more of them , and they &apos;re going to be able to be a island of the world , and they &apos;re a island .
then they just use what &apos;s there on sun and wind there where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a nuclear energy supply , and i &apos;m plato , that they &apos;ve said , solar energy .
and that &apos;s what we do , and it &apos;s the way that we get in the talk , the talk of the ted , that you can be a collective , and you can use solar power , a little together .
and yes , i just want to encourage you to be able to be quiet in the sense that you can be quiet , and you can have a vision .
and you really have to stay pretty tough , but i think it &apos;s going to be .
thank you .
when steve lopez , a little bit of the los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he was going to see a wonderful music .
she came from a man , an african-american , a little bit of rough , a homeless , homeless , who had been playing on a violin , which had only two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from the book of the article , it was later a book that was turned back to robert atwood , and jo &apos;s new , jr , and jamie &apos;s chief , who was at the top of the day ,
nathaniel left in juilliard , suffered a breakdown and 30 years later , he lived in the streets of the street row of the los angeles of los angeles .
i recommend reading the book , or to watch the film , so that you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that came between these two men , but also how the music was able to make this connection , and how it was the instrument that helped the
i met mr. floyd in 2008 , two years ago , in walt disney hall .
he just had a demo of beethoven &apos;s first symphony and fourth symphony , and came behind the stage to imagine .
he talked to a very high and barren note about yo-yo ma and hillary clinton and the way the dodgers never could do it in baseball series of the baseball series , and that &apos;s because of the dodgers &apos;s first violin of beethoven &apos;s fourth symphony .
we came to speak to music . and a few days later , i got an email in which nathaniel was interested in me .
i have to mention that nathaniel was a medical treatment , because he was already treated with electricity and with the plastic and ordered and ordered it , a trauma that has been following his whole life .
as a result , he &apos;s very prone to this schizophrenic stages , and that &apos;s sometimes so bad , and he &apos;s going to go back to the streets of the street row , and it &apos;s been exposed to the streets of the street row , always that
and in fact , nathaniel , when we started with our first class in walt disney , began to have this crazy thing in the northeast of his eyes and worked completely lost .
he talked about invisible gillian and smoke and how someone was going to poison up in sleep .
i was afraid not to be , but i was afraid that i could lose him , that he could sink into one of his states and i could destroy his relationship to the violin , if i started talking about scale and the other exciting forms of the world
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven &apos;s .
and while i played , i fell in the eyes of the eye , and i was going to be a complete change .
it was when he was under the influence of a invisible drug , a chemical response , which was a catalyst .
and the institutional anger turned out anger in understanding , and you &apos;re terrified of a quiet curiosity .
and as through a miracle he took his violin and started playing some little clips of the sound of a few of the pieces and then asked me to end up with it : &quot; -- whoa , &quot; the head of life , the head of life .
we started talking about music , starting from bach , and , from beethoven , , and , of course , the other other species of the other , from the street to the street , to the very top of the street .
and i realized that he had not only known a single knowledge of music about music , but it also connected to her very close personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i know just from my colleagues in the bass of los angeles .
by playing music and talking about music , it was a confused man , confused man who had moved through the streets of los angeles , a football musician , a musician , and he had a musician , in juilliard .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for nathaniel , music means emotional health .
because the music allows him to be his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and the creativity of the real estate .
and so he &apos;s so on his gallup condition .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
this is the reason why we make music : we do something that is in all of us deep inside , our emotions , through our artistic lens , through our creativity , actually form the reality .
and the reality of this expression is all of us , and it &apos;s inspired , inspired and collectively .
so what nathaniel set up , the music came back into a community of friends .
the power force of music brought him back into a family of musicians who understood it , and he was looking at his talent .
and i &apos;m going to keep with nathaniel , no matter whether in walt disney , or in the row row , because he reminds me why i became musicians .
thank you .
bruno &apos;s : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i &apos;m going to have to get to the ted team .
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i just loved two .
this first , that was more like a passionate kind of genius .
it was a beautiful fish , a good consistency , a good consistency , a story of a menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was being rejected in a corporate world for the highest highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel like selling it to sell him .
i had a relationship with this beauty about several months .
one day , the ceo of the company called , and i said , &quot; if i could go on a book about sustainability , &quot; i was thinking about the farm .
&quot; of course , i said .
here was a company trying to solve what this unimaginable problem for our cooks has become . how do we keep fish on our oars ?
in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve planted the ocean as we &apos;ve acquired forests bare .
it &apos;s hard to be the destruction of the destruction .
90 percent of the great fish , which we love , the tunas , the most sophisticated , the most profound , the downs , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , you know , it &apos;s going to be a lot of nasty , or bad , a part of our future .
many arguments about it . the environment , most of you , the most of you , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take a big disadvantage . a big disadvantage .
he has a training of 15 to one .
that means that 15 pounds of plastic is needed to get a pound of a pound .
not very sustainable .
it doesn &apos;t taste very well .
so here was finally a company that tried to do it right .
i wanted to help them .
the day before the event , i called the boss of the pr company for the company .
let &apos;s call him don .
&quot; don &apos;t say , &quot; just to have the facts right , you &apos;re famous for that , so far outside the sea , that you don &apos;t get thrown in the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far outside , that the waste is distributed from our fish , not focused . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this is a little bit of the time of the ted phase , he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
and in the same phase , great .
&quot; the next thing to do ? what feeds her ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . put on .
and at this evening , i was in bed and thought , what is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , short , just before the event , don &apos;t do .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you like , for example , what are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to be an object .
now , i &apos;m going to put a couple of people in the company . nobody could give me a permanent answer to the senior biologist , until finally , i finally had the senior biologist .
let &apos;s call it as well as don &apos;t call it .
&quot; don &apos;t i say , &quot; what for example are sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some of the things that he said , and then he said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to go . &quot;
i said , &quot; do you know ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , feathers , skin , dirt , dirt , dry and dry . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your life is chicken ? &quot;
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
&quot; well , these are about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t don &apos;t do that , to feed chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the line and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i &apos;m going to get off this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a computer maker and a nuclear drum .
that &apos;s me .
no , i actually have a little bit of fish in this fish , because , i swear to god , the fish , which was looking for this conversation after chicken .
this second fish , this is another kind of love story .
it &apos;s romantic art , the way you know the better you learn to know your fish , you all love the fish .
i was eating him first in a restaurant in a restaurant restaurant .
a very big journalist had spoken for a long time .
it &apos;s kind of a sense of engineering .
he came up with a bright , almost more , almost a white white white color .
the chef had him .
wait twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can make a fish so well after it became a fish ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
we call him an unprotected . actually , he &apos;s an intimidating .
and no , he doesn &apos;t cook the fish and he &apos;s not a chef , at least on the way that you and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at the heart of la la .
this is a very uplifting place in the corner of spain .
it &apos;s near the mouth of the river .
until the 1980s was the farm in the hands of the mother &apos;s hands .
they were growing up on what they were basically in wetlands .
they did that by putting the land out .
they built these complicated roles of channels , and they release water from the land and out in the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t do that that they did not work economically .
and the green was a disaster .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds to do that , which is a lot of birds .
and so in 1982 , a spanish company has bought the land .
what did they do ?
they &apos;re going to track the flow of the water .
they literally cleaned the lever .
instead of using the water , they used the channels to get the water back back .
they &apos;re making the channels .
they created a 11,000 acres of water -- the internet , the shrimp , shrimp , shrimp , shrimp , and he &apos;s got an agile , and his company the ecological destruction completely covers .
the farm is incredibly .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen something like that .
they stare out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is the most powerful channels and these density , lush march .
i didn &apos;t have a long time in there at all .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts , charles darwin and a subset of &quot; a crocodile to kiss . &quot;
okay ? we were fighting and fought through the wetlands and i &apos;m going to go and see glucose , and i have glucose to my knees , and bud keeps a single arm .
this is what he &apos;s going to get out of a rare fashion .
now he &apos;s mentioning the most populous of lawns .
and here , here he sees a pattern of concentrate that reminds him of the most salient giraffe .
it turns out that mckinsey has spent the biggest part of his career in the national national park in africa .
i asked him how to become a computer scientist .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes and falls in more talk from rare birds and algae and weird and bizarre .
and you don &apos;t understand me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the most powerful community , in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was love in love .
and my head was weak about this kind of delicious piece of delicious fish that i had at the time .
so i cut him up . i said , &quot; bud , how does it taste your fish so well ? &quot;
he showed up the algae .
&quot; i know boy , the algae , the powder , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what are your fish ?
how is the most important ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me that it &apos;s such a wonderful system that the fish eat , what they would eat in the wild .
the ones that are the ones that reproduce , the dependencies , the harbor , that &apos;s what fish feeds .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely unfair .
there &apos;s no food .
the one of the things that you &apos;re not feeding is that your animals are feeding ?
and i went to this site with a psychopathic walk around , and i asked him , &quot; for a place that seems to be like , &quot; well , for a place that seems to be , &quot; how do you have to be , &quot; how do you
in the moment , it was like a movie movie would have a computer movie .
and we had the bow around the corner and we offered the most incredible look , thousands and thousands of pinker , a literally pinker carpet that &apos;s so far the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look your blood bills , pink .
they &apos;re going to be . &quot;
so , i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; bud , do you not have your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and we &apos;re going to go to birds .
now , last year , 600,000 birds were over 250 birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s now the largest and one of the most important private gas systems in all europe .
i said , &quot; bud , is a good job of a good job , not the last thing you want to have on a top of a car ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building a lot of fusion , not intense .
this is an environmental network .
the most important food is eating the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the replication .
so the more the enemy the same is the better system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rethink that . one farm that doesn &apos;t feed your animals and a farm that measures their success on health &apos;s health .
a more powerful , but also a more mature .
oh , and by the way , these are not even the same as that we have in the beginning .
they breed in a city of 240 miles away where the most important thing is to the cost of the water .
every morning they fly 240 miles on the farm .
and every night they fly 240 miles .
they &apos;re doing that because they can follow the white white line of the highway .
seriously .
i was introduced a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked up a little bit .
i said , &quot; bud , fly up 240 miles to the farm and then fly 240 miles at night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me when i was quoted by the whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like a throwaway job . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this kind of nylon taste , flavor taste .
i almost never cook with it .
and yet , when i tried to put them in this restaurant in the hospital in the hospital , they didn &apos;t feel like they were doing it .
she liked sweet and pure , when you would take a bite from the ocean .
i mentioned the psychopathic and he &apos;s going to be a freaking .
he said , &quot; the skin works like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last defense , before something happens in the body .
it &apos;s evolved in evolution to tear up the contaminated dissection . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no control . &quot;
okay . one farm that doesn &apos;t feed their fish . a farm that measures their success on success .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm that doesn &apos;t have a farm , he &apos;s a huge , because the water that comes through this farm is coming out of the stream .
it &apos;s a river that leads all the things to be , and it &apos;s going to be that it &apos;s going to be a chemical , and it &apos;s going to be a chemical pollutants , flow of ultraviolet power .
and when it &apos;s fought through the system , and it &apos;s the water cleaner , it &apos;s a clean , as it is called the water .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not only a farm that &apos;s not feeding your animals , not just a farm that measures your success on health &apos;s health , but a farm that is literally a more nuanced , and not just for those fish , but for you and me .
because when the water is going to be the water , it &apos;s in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;m going to take you , and that &apos;s what you should do , because this love love , how romantic , is also an explanation .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future good food , whether we &apos;re talking about the world &apos;s or the world &apos;s sake .
what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food actually good taste .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit radical .
we &apos;re not a plastic system , we &apos;re not going to be a pilot . we &apos;re masters .
we love farmers . we love small amounts of dna . we talk about local food . we &apos;re eating organic .
and if you say that the things that are good for the future is somebody who &apos;s in the future of good food , and says , &quot; hey , people , i love the world &apos;s , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;ve already made enough calories to feed the world more than just feeding the world .
a billion people are starving today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of the inequalities in the distribution , not the gas emissions .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because she &apos;s the logic of our favorite , the last 50 years of the last 50 years .
feed crops to herbivores , the chemicals on the earth , chicken on the earth , chicken on fish , and the whole time has the agribusiness , and the whole time we feed the agribusiness , how awful can that be ? &quot;
this was the cause . it was the kind of thing . it was the business business of american agriculture .
we should call them what they &apos;re , a business in a corporate , a business industry , which is just allowing the basic environmental capital to make that production .
this is not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our main system is endangered , not because of the most sophisticated , but not by the other way of being developed .
not by the latest health and industrial systems , but by fertile land , not by pumps , but through fresh water , not by the hydrogen , but through forests , and through the forests of the ocean , and it &apos;s through fish , and it &apos;s through
you want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that allow each community to feed themselves ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the most sophisticated for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
capital , chemistry and machines are in charge of it , and it never really made a good thing to eat .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is that in two billion years , that &apos;s related to that .
look at an automatic farmer like batman .
businesses who are not the worlds for themselves , they were doing , rather than a matter of food , they &apos;re making the food care rather than just intense , farmers who are not just making it , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , experts
because they are the ones that are experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i ever will be .
you know , that &apos;s my right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to illustrate you today , it &apos;s that the total data we consume is greater than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking about it , i think that they can think about how we can use information that way , that the pattern would
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical star model after age .
the program i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called the most powerful and what i can do with a certain cause of death , and we can say accidents .
and i immediately see another pattern that makes it possible .
and that &apos;s because in the field of the world , people are active , and they &apos;re over here at the time .
we can move one step further and then line up the data , and see that the most common and cancer is the usual suspects , but not for everyone .
now , if we go on and look at age , we &apos;ll see 40 years or younger , we &apos;re going to see accidents that are actually concerned about people .
and who &apos;s looking at the most powerful is true of men .
so you see that this is a very , very much of the information and data in this way , and it &apos;s very closely remembered in a living environment .
and if we can do this for data why not for content itself ?
now what we &apos;re now here is the most of the dollar &apos;s team of &quot; sports &apos;s &quot; that ever been printed .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it to my talk in their rooms .
with a more difficult , you can be immersed in a decade .
you can dive into a particular year .
you can jump directly to a certain copy .
now , if i look here , i see the athletes that appear in this issue and the sport .
i &apos;m an lance armstrong &apos;s orchestra , so i click on this here , which is where all of the people who are told me to show the unfinished sachs .
now , if i want to get a snapshot of a snapshot , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at anything with the subject of palm ? &quot;
so i go back to a step and i go back to the perspective .
now i see greg plastic .
and so you get an idea of that , if you were looking at this kind of information , more prevalent , wider , vivid , you don &apos;t look at it or be in dongguan , you don &apos;t just look at it or be in dongguan .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
it &apos;s something between and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to take a little further on this idea , which is a little bit crazy .
what we did here is we &apos;ve taken every single type of dna and it &apos;s reduced to a little summary .
the summary contains a short , a symbol of the area that comes from it .
i just show the top 500 of the top of the glass .
but even in this narrow view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately , we get a sense of the themes that are on wikipedia at the top of the glass .
i &apos;m going to choose the government &apos; government .
now , after i chose the government , i know that the most important thing that &apos;s going on most of the time magazine is the time magazine .
this is really important , because this is a realization that doesn &apos;t exist in a single fashion .
that &apos;s just to see if you go back and look at the whole thing .
so , basically , looking at a particular one of these summaries , i can go into time magazine magazine , and all of us see it in the year , and all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i know that the majority of these are the majority of the world . some of them come from science . some , even less , come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can jump and look at all the ted prize face .
you see , we &apos;re looking at the net , the first time it &apos;s really a net , not just side , but much abstract .
and so i want to show you what a little surprise might be .
i just show you the new york times website .
so , the use of this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can look at websites with it -- and we bring these pieces of pieces to each other .
so i can go back to a step , and right to a specific unit of manipulation .
so this is important because you just look at the way websites look at these kinds of websites in this way , and the whole way to look at the same way in the same way .
so i can zoom in in my course in a particular place .
here &apos;s the one of the total demonstration i &apos;ve been given to here .
and i can sort of get anything i &apos;ve been looking at today , again , again .
and , again , when i step back to a step and look at everything , i can put my journey into my journey , maybe i went to the search of my life , and here , i went to the search of the city , and here ,
and i can go from here to the side and get them to call back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used again , and every time it makes it bigger than the sum of the brain .
in the moment , in this world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the oscar &apos;s car .
we &apos;re talking about drowning in information .
what if we could turn this situation around and put the internet on the head , so that instead of going from one to another , we can start to go from many things to many things , and see patterns that would otherwise stay otherwise hidden ?
if we can do this , then this past , we can get a new source of ways of making information .
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge of that .
and if we know , maybe we can even pull out wisdom from that .
so i hear , thank you very much .
i grew up with a science portion of science fiction .
i went to school with the bus to school , every day a day .
and my nose kept in a book , a book , a computer project that my thoughts in other worlds put in the worlds , and in the way my deep way to put it in my own , fuzzy curiosity , it &apos;s fuzzy curiosity .
this curiosity also showed that i was not in school , through the forests , and the forests were collected , and &quot; samples , &quot; frogs and snakes and beetles and beetles and the bugs , and it was going to be a lot of time , and it
i was totally troubled , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world and the boundaries of the possible sequence .
and my love to science fiction seemed to be in my environment , because at the time , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and we explored the deep sea .
jacques cousteau came to our living room with his fascinating shows that animals and places and a world of wonder showed us that we could never have imagined .
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s really good about at the time of this kind of thing .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and since it wasn &apos;t video games , there &apos;s no video games with imagery , the whole imagery in the media landscape , had to create the images in my head .
we had to have all of these . if we read a book , we took the description of the author and put them on the screen in our heads .
my response to that was drawing and paint from aliens , aliens , stars , robots , and all of that .
in math math , i was constantly caught from the teacher , as i hid , in the textbook , in the textbook .
creativity had to be kind of out .
and what happened is something interesting . because what i was fascinated with , to jacques , was the idea of a completely unknown world here on our planet .
i certainly never would have a alien world with a spaceship , and i was quite unlikely .
but here was a world that i could actually enter here on earth , and it was as fascinating and exotic as all i &apos;ve been introduced to what i was doing as i was reading these books .
so i decided to be 15 , scuba divers .
the only problem that i was living in in a small village in canada , 1,000 miles from the next ocean .
i didn &apos;t leave that frustrated .
i was going to see my father , until finally , a computer company in buffalo , new york , and he had been discovering exactly on the other side of the border where we lived .
i made my favorite school in a pool of the middle of the winter in the winter in the winter of the winter in buffalo , new york .
but the ocean , but a real ocean , i got two years later to face when we went to california .
since then , in 40 years , the ones that are now , i &apos;ve spent about three hours of water under the water , 500 hours of in istanbul .
and i learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the ocean , is so rich in the ocean , as rich as we can really barely imagine .
the imagination of nature doesn &apos;t know borders , in contrast to our own , more powerful human imagination .
and for today , i feel the deepest awe of what i see on my dives .
and my love to the ocean is holding , with the same intensity as ever and ever .
when i was a prisoner , it was a job of the fan .
this seemed the best way to tell my inner urge to create stories with my need , to create images .
as a child , i was constantly drawing comic books and so on .
so movies of the way , images and stories are brought together .
of course , the stories i was looking at , from the computer , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens , &quot; and &quot; the &quot; abyss . &quot;
in the &quot; abyss &quot; i could get my predilection to the most underwater and the walking with the fan .
so , basically , my two passions .
something interesting happened in the &quot; back &quot; to solve a problem of this film -- and that &apos;s what we had to create as a kind of liquid air model -- we did a computer-generated animation , we &apos;re going to play on a computer-generated animation , and we
what came out of that was the first computer-generated computer-generated that ever was in a movie .
the film didn &apos;t bring money to the fact , he just played his costs , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience on the world was like mesmerized from the magic , which was going to be swallowed by the magic .
according to arthur clarke , the law is really the same technology and magic of any other way .
so they saw something magical .
and i found this incredibly exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s really going to be involved in the way that you &apos;re going to be in the air industry . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , still much further .
together with the food campaign , we made the guys out there , and the guy was going to be liquid metal , and the success was completely dependent on how this effect would come .
and it worked . again , we created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same . but we have a little more money in the movie .
from these two experiences based on this , a whole new world of creativity is a whole new world of creativity for the internet .
so i started a company with my good friend keene who was at the time of the best ted and the most powerful , and she was called &quot; digital tv . &quot;
the idea of this company was to be analog processes with visual printers , and start to start with digital design models .
we also did this and we managed to give us a chance of a chance .
but the mid- &apos; 90s discovered that we were in the field of business and we found the company that we had , which we actually started to do -- too slow .
i had written this piece , &quot; avatar &quot; that the bar in things that are visual effects and the effects of the whole , with comparable human beings , with selfish human , expressive characters that were made by using the technology , and the world should be the
but the bar really came back to the very same . and people in my company told me that we weren &apos;t able to be able to do that .
so i moved that and i did this other film about the big ship that &apos;s going on .
i was selling this as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship . &quot; it became a giant epic epic , a passionate movie .
but i was really longing to be the real train of the titanic .
so i made the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
i believe you , by saying , &quot; we &apos;re going to go to the train . we &apos;re shooting the real train .
we &apos;re going to show it in the movie of the film .
this is hugely important . it &apos;s a good job for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund an expedition .
sounds crazy . but it &apos;s going back to that , that the human imagination can create a reality .
we actually created six months later , in which i was in a russian , early , four miles under the north atlantic , and i started to look at the real titanic through a plastic model .
this was not a movie , no , no , no , it was .
so , that really blew me up .
and the guidance of this was enormous . we had to build cameras and the lights and everything .
and i fell like this , like this , a very , very , very , kind of , a game of play .
well , they were also more competent and more sophisticated planning .
you go up into these capsule , you go down into this dark , hot environment , where no hope is on saving , if you don &apos;t get back to it .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as if i &apos;m in a museum of a book .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was obsessed with the deep sea of the deep sea .
anyway , in the part of the thing that &apos;s related to curiosity , it was all . it was adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that could not give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could create , and i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside the window .
in some of the following expeditions , i saw creatures in the lab , and sometimes things that i haven &apos;t seen before , sometimes things that nobody had seen before , and for the science of the time , when we saw them , they didn &apos;t find words
so that &apos;s really what i really did , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met a slightly unusual decision .
after success , i said , &quot; okay , i want my favorite prize to a filmmaker in hollywood , and i &apos;m going to get a little bit of a time for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we started to go to &quot; the &quot; design &quot; and research with the team of research .
we went back to the titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which was a design of a steel system .
our intention was to look at the interior and the inside of the ship , which was never been done before .
no one had the internal exploration of the brain . you didn &apos;t have any means for it . so we developed the technology .
and so i &apos;m sitting there , on the deck of the titanic , in a refugee , and you see pollock that this is quite similar to this , and i know that once the band has played there .
and i fly with a little baby camera through the back of the ship .
i &apos;m actually committed to it , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i &apos;m physically within the titanic of the titanic .
this was the most powerful form of a laser that i ever experienced , because before i put on a corner , i always knew what was going on in the car &apos;s office , i was going to run the film for months when we were writing the film
so the set was a very accurate copy of the developer of the ship .
so that was a very strange experience .
and it made me realize that this was a little bit of the way that you use such a little bit of energy , and so you can get your consciousness into the vehicle , in these other forms of existence .
it was really immensely profound .
and maybe a little view of what might happen in some decades if you have a little bit of time to explore something or to do other things , in all kinds of different forms of information that i can imagine as a design tool .
after these expeditions , we started what we saw down there , really appreciate how to see this incredibly amazing animals , which is basically alien , but here on earth .
they live with help of pest .
they don &apos;t exist in a sunlight of reference , like we do .
and so you see animals that are right next to 500 degrees centigrade that they can survive there .
and i was also interested in the same time , and i was also very interested in the most of the time of the world &apos;s life .
and so i ended up with people who are interested in doing the space and to do the nasa and the right thing to do , and they &apos;re going to be the right , go through russia , go through the mission of the mission , and then take
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it was going to be that i took a little bit of the deep sea in the deep sea .
i took them and i put them up to the world , and i &apos;m going to go up there , and the world &apos;s , the people who were interested in such extreme situations , i took them to the sources of things that they could take around and
we did play , but actually , science , more specifically , said , &quot; well , &quot; -- it &apos;s a lot of time .
so the circle of my existence as a child &apos;s own life , as a child , was when the child , and the real estate .
in the course of this voyage , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m certainly thinking , a director has to be able to be a leader , like a computer designer or something .
i didn &apos;t understand much of leadership before i put this zone up .
because at a certain point , i had to say , &quot; what do i actually do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
this is a complete film that makes us not a cash .
we &apos;re just playing the costs of the control . from fame .
all of you think i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and i would have a rock on a towel on a towel .
i &apos;ve all got these films , this piece of notation , for a very small audience .
no glory , no honor , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re doing it for the task to be the challenge , and the ocean is the most powerful environment that exists . you &apos;re making it the most powerful , and because of the strange connection , which is coming up when a small group of people form a
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who have worked for years , and sometimes we were two to three months on sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the probability of the one that you have , because you have a job that you can &apos;t explain to you .
if you go back to land , and says , &quot; we had to do it , the most poetic , the most profound , and the whole thing that the whole technology , and the trouble , the human performance , if you &apos;re working on the sea ,
there &apos;s a connection , and it &apos;s an unprecedented respect .
so when i came back to turn my next film , &quot; avatar &quot; tried to use the same leadership , which is that you make his team , and that &apos;s what makes respect in return to respect .
so this is actually changing the dynamics .
so i was back to a little team of unknown terrain , and we did &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technology that hasn &apos;t had before .
incredibly exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we became a very , a new family , a second family .
so , my way of making films is completely changed .
there were people who were saying we had this kind of thing that was really good at the planet , and we &apos;ve been transported to the planet .
for me , it was more a kind of a kind of a design way to do my job , which has changed the actual process , which has changed in the outcome .
so what can we do from all of this ?
what lessons are we learning ?
i think the first thing is , the curiosity is .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the chance of your team is more important than all the world &apos;s favorite .
i come to me young filmmakers who say , &quot; give me a advice , how i can do something like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t even do you .
that &apos;s already going to get other people . don &apos;t do it yourself , bet not yourself . but take risks for you . &quot;
nasa has a kind of a design of the question : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in art , and in the process of exploring an alternative , it has to be an alternative , because there &apos;s a more nuanced thing there .
no important effort , the innovation was expected to have been adopted without risk .
you have to be willing to take risks like this .
this is the thought that i &apos;d like to give you on the way to get on the way , failure is not an alternative , but it &apos;s not . thank you .
today i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and perhaps that might be something that &apos;s going to be because my favorite group in the foundation is mainly about vaccines and seeds to make things that we invent and deliver to the poorest 2 billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than for any other on the planet .
so , the fact that the world &apos;s brain is that their crops are not going to grow over many years , and we &apos;re too much too little rain . the things are going to change as their fragile environment cannot be able to sustain .
it leads to the most profound . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , a climate change is going to be terrible for you .
and also , the most important thing for you is very important .
the fact is , if you could reduce the price of the price , the energy is far worse at the most effective level .
well , the most important thing is that the time is like that .
in fact , the most important thing is called the energy movement .
the main thing that the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , had a rapid case in the south bronx , and so we have refrigerators , air air , we can make a modern materials and do so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s cut the price down -- we &apos;re going to go to a new barrier and the barrier with co2 .
co2 warming the planet and the equation for co2 is actually quite clear .
they add the carbon footprint , which leads to the most powerful and a few very negative effects , and effects on the weather and maybe worse , which is the very indirect consequence that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt and collapse all the systems .
well , the exact relationship between a computer model and the net , and where their other follow are , there are some of the things that are the most of the favor of the world , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certainly ambiguity about how bad these consequences are going to be . but they &apos;re extremely bad .
i asked the most of the times , &quot; do we really have to go down near zero ?
does not half or a quarter of the one ? &quot;
the answer is , until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue to climb .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different to say , we have a quarter yards of high truck , which has to go under a three feet , and then you can basically put it underneath .
this is really going to have to go down , zero .
now , we &apos;re going to run a lot of carbon dioxide , over 26 billion tons .
every americans about 20 tons of people , people from poor countries , less than one .
in average , it &apos;s about five tons of for every planet on the planet .
and somehow we have to create changes that lower that in zero .
it &apos;s been up there .
just different economic changes , and we have to go from the rise of environmental prices to reducing a reduction to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of inorganic . they have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that you want to get towards zero and that will depend on the number of people who are using the average energy for service and the co2 energy
so let &apos;s take a look at each factor and think about how we get this on zero .
probably one of these numbers must come very close to zero .
now , this is basic algebra , but let &apos;s go through it .
we first have the population .
now , mysore billion people live .
and it &apos;s about nine billion of these days to move on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new vaccines , the most powerful and more powerful , we might be able to reduce 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time , we see a slope to be 1.3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
it &apos;s all that we eat , food that we eat , clothing , heat .
these are very good things , and we &apos;re doing this , almost every one of the things that are available to the planet .
it &apos;s great that these number goes up .
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we might be able to make selective replication and use less use , but in average , this number will increase every year and double more than double , and so more than double the service of services .
here we see a very basic service . there &apos;s a lot of light at home , so you can read your homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their online rights under the bottom .
now , at efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s finally good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go up .
because of various successes in the field of brain , through other kinds of information , through new ways of technology , there are many services that make some of the energy services to save 90 percent .
in other services , as the manufacturing of the design , 65 ninth : in 1926 , d -- &amp; lt ; d : in 1926 , in the middle of the world , in 1926 , the box of improvement is very much smaller .
in total , if we &apos;re optimistic , we may get a reduction to a factor of three or maybe a factor of six .
but at the first three factors , we &apos;re now at 26 billion tons of dollars , and that &apos;s just not enough !
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 that is going to be a unit of energy .
it turns out to be a question of whether you can get this on zero .
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every single car system for electricity today is co2 , except renewables and water companies .
so , what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need to be more reactive .
now , if i use the word &quot; wonders , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and services is a miracle .
people here contributed to many of these wonders .
usually there &apos;s no deadline that you need a miracle to take a certain date .
usually you &apos;re just following the next thing , and some people come , not .
but in this case , we have to get more and a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how can i really get that really get that ?
is there a natural dispute , a demonstration that &apos;s going to be the idea of people here ?
i remembered last year when i brought mosquitos and liked the people .
the idea was really tangible for them , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
and for energy , i fell here .
i decided that the back of fireflies would be my favorite contribution to the environment here .
so here &apos;s a couple of natural fireflies .
you &apos;ve got me told that she doesn &apos;t bite . you can &apos;t even leave the glass .
well , there are all kinds of things like this , but they don &apos;t get a lot of them .
we need solutions , either one or a few of the people have a unimaginable scaling and unimaginable government , and even though there are many directions where people are looking for , i really see five , which are the big demands .
i left tides , and i went to the tides , and we dropped fusion and biofuels .
this may be a moderate contribution , and if you expect better than i expect , it &apos;s great , but my theory is that we need to work on all of these five , and we can &apos;t give them more significant , because they &apos;re scary , because
let &apos;s first look at the burning fossil fuels , burning from either coal or natural gas .
what you have to do there is maybe just , but it &apos;s not . you need to have all the co2 , which comes from the fog , you can get out of pressure , and then you &apos;re hoping that there &apos;s still going to stay there .
there &apos;s some of these things that are going on on a 60 percent -- 80 percent of them will be able to get very difficult , and it &apos;s going to be a very difficult way to get the carbon care , and a really challenging problem for the
who will make it sure ?
who can guarantee something that literally many billion times larger than any kind of garbage , you can imagine from the other kind of garbage and other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a tough thing called a tough thing .
next : double , patent .
it has three great problems . the cost of most of the countries are high , and the question for security is that you really feel that you can &apos;t go wrong , despite the human involvement , that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the trash ?
because although he &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that might be soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work .
the last three of the five i put in .
it &apos;s the renewables , as they &apos;re often called .
and also , even though it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need a fuel -- you have some drawbacks .
one is the density of energy that makes these technologies dramatically than the power of power .
these are the most powerful , you talk about many of the world &apos;s data , 1,000 times more area than a normal power station .
and also , these sources are going to be fooled .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem all day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be any day and so on the wind doesn &apos;t waste all the day .
so , if you &apos;re dependent on these sources , you have to have a way to get energy in times when you &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s great data here . there are challenges in transmission . if we say that the energy source is outside the country , you don &apos;t need to just have the technology , you have to also have the risk of where different from it comes from .
and there &apos;s the most profound thing .
and to show the dimension , i &apos;ve all been able to look at the kinds of batteries that are made , and the computer , computer phones , mobile phones , for everything , and that &apos;s what i used to do with the amount of electronic energy ,
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that will be a factor of 100 better than the approaches to the time .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
that &apos;s what happens when you try to get these pieces of sources over , we &apos;re going to take 20 percent -- 30 percent of the rest of the rest .
if you want to be 100 percent on it , you need an incredible amount of energy .
now , where should we go : what is the right approach ?
a manhattan project ? how do we get to the target ?
what we need is a lot of companies working on it . hundreds .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
so , in many of you will say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think there &apos;s a lot of people who have already been involved there .
bill big has multiple companies , among other things , called a &quot; adorable world . &quot;
and the other thing that &apos;s great about the world &apos;s research is to invest in dozens of companies , and what &apos;s interesting , and i &apos;m trying to support it .
nathan myhrvold and i fund a company that , perhaps surprisingly , is to follow the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in the world &apos;s brain ; it &apos;s called , liquid , liquid .
the development has stopped in this industry a few times ago , so it &apos;s not a great surprise that some good concepts are lying around .
the most important thing that you do is you think instead of one part of the world &apos;s brain , one percent , the most important , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the most powerful one .
this is a pretty crazy idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it , but you could never simulate reasonable simulate , but since there was modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , you can simulate it , and see that , yes , it &apos;s going to lead a long-term job
and because you burn this 99 percent , it &apos;s a lot better .
in fact , you burn the waste , and you can actually use the waste of today &apos;s waste as a matter of cyber reactors .
instead of breaking the head , they just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is used gradually , a little bit like a candle .
you see it &apos;s a kind of column , often as a traveling wave reactor .
that really solves the most important thing .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s burned today , so it &apos;s called the uranium uranium .
the u.s. spends hundreds of years .
and if you &apos;re cheap , and you just get a lot of fuel , you get enough fuel for your rest of the planet .
you know , there are many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to come forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
how should our testimony look like ?
now , let &apos;s go to the goal that we have to get to , and then we talk about the design .
many talks about 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
it &apos;s really important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be produced in poor countries , and still something agriculture is going to be , hopefully , and it &apos;s going to be clean to the cement and cement .
so , to get this 80 percent to do the world , the countries like china , including the world , is completely changing .
the other grade says if we use the technology technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
this is great .
this is going to change a shift of this .
if we go back from there , how should the 2020 review of the 2020 ?
it should be again the two elements .
we should use the most sophisticated use to bring reduction to the way . the less we will be the lower , the lower , the lower temperature , and the temperature also .
but actually , this note for the things that we do is not fully to lead to the big bang , just right , or even less important than the other that &apos;s the speed of innovation for these breakthroughs .
we have to track these breakthroughs with the very root and we can measure that : in the field of entertainment , in the field of food and business .
there are many great books to this topic .
al gore book &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david &apos;s energy &apos;s energy system , the hot air force . &quot;
they really go through it , and they can make a frame where this can be discussed wide , because we need to support for all the pages .
there &apos;s a lot of that coming together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very high wish , we &apos;re going to invent this technology .
if you just take me one wish for the next 50 years , i could pick the president , a vaccine , and i love that , or i could choose that wish , which is , that &apos;s the case that is going to take the hope , i
this has the largest impact .
if we don &apos;t get that wish , the dig of the long time is going to be terrible and the long time people are getting terrible between the united states and china , between poor and rich , and almost all of these two billion of these two billion
so what do we need to do ?
what is the power of what &apos;s going on ?
we need to use more research research for more research research .
if countries are meeting in places like a nuclear record , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about co2 .
they should discuss these miniature steps and they were shocked by the ridiculous few funds that are spent for these innovative approaches .
we need to control carbon dioxide , carbon taxes , and trade &amp; amp ; trade , something that creates a nuclear reactor .
we need to spread the message .
we need to have a conversation more rational and complete and a complete thing , and the things that are going to be done by the government .
it &apos;s a very important wish , but i think we can meet it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . just to understand a little bit better -- first , can you give us a notion of scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to get the simulation on a supercomputer , all the great scientists we &apos;ve made , we just need a few million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it &apos;s really useful , you &apos;re only in
the difficult step is building the first parking , more billion , and the place that is actually building the first of these first of these .
once the first thing is done , when he &apos;s going to go like that , it &apos;s all very clear , because the economic energy is so different as the energy of the world as we know it .
to understand that right , which means to build deep in the ground almost like a vertical column of nuclear fuel , that uses this child &apos;s process and then starts working on the bottom , and then continues to go down ?
so , the fact is , right . you have to use the reactor , so there &apos;s lots of people and lots of control , which can go wrong . this thing is going to be a thing where you open it and make things . that &apos;s not
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can use it for 60 years -- think about a column -- that you &apos;re buried without all the complexities .
and it &apos;s going to be there and it &apos;s going to be 60 years long , and then it &apos;s done .
a more powerful one , which offers a solution to the garbage .
so , yes , yes . well , what happens to the garbage : you can sit in it -- you can sit in a lot less waste with this method -- then you take it and put it in the next reactor and burn it in the next reactor
and we start by taking the waste , which is already exists , which is in these twin spots or the reactors , and that &apos;s our favorite .
so , what this reactors was a problem is that what we put in our and that is reducing the most dramatic dramatic model in the process of this process .
but while they &apos;ve talked about these kinds of people around the world , they &apos;ve been talking about these possibilities .
where is the biggest interest , what really makes it really ?
so , we &apos;ve not been able to put it on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting amounts of interesting for everything that &apos;s called the nuclear , and it &apos;s a lot of interest , and people of the company were in russia , india
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is a kind of thing that was made .
this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a little reactor and some countries have built this , so everybody who &apos;s done a quick reactor , a very rapid reactor for our first .
in your mind , do you think of it , and the way that you really get to life ?
so , we need one of these , we need one of these most popular things , the things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to use it .
this is basically the deadline that has been given us the most sophisticated point that we need to follow .
and , you know , the most powerful , if everything is fine , and that &apos;s a big wish , that might be easy .
and fortunately , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of things that , as you work , when their approaches works , they can do that for their pilots , to get to work for their pilots .
and it would be best if it could do multiple , because then you could use a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
and the great amount of breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
so , the most important thing is , a key thing is most important .
it would have been without the most important thing , but it &apos;s the power that makes it more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we know that we don &apos;t know how well this one , but there are the modular method , that &apos;s another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid water system , which seems to be a little bit difficult , but maybe the people say that .
and so there &apos;s different , but the beautiful thing is that a million times a million times as much energy as you say , we say , a design and so , if you can deal with the problems and the cost , the impact , the impact ,
if that doesn &apos;t work , what then ?
we need to introduce a lot of time to try to keep the difference to the target ?
so , if you get to this situation , it &apos;s as if you eat too much , and a heart attack is a heart attack . what you do ? you may need a cardiac procedure or something like that .
there &apos;s a research research called the most recent time that &apos;s going to be able to delay the kinds of techniques to delay warming , so we would have been given 20 or 30 years longer to get us to the rest of us .
this is just a more powerful thing .
you hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you don &apos;t really want to work on insurance , because maybe you &apos;re going to go to the only way that you &apos;re eating , because you know that you will save the savings .
i don &apos;t know if it &apos;s smart , if you &apos;re the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a discourse in a lot of time , whether you should have the things that you should have , if things come faster , or even more , and
climate change : have you got one or two sentences for you to convince you ?
so , the skeptics , well , the skeptics is in very different camps .
those who do scientific arguments are very little .
do you say that there are negative effects that have to do with the clouds that are moving things ?
there are very , very few things you can say at all , which is a chance of a million .
the dominant way that we think about aids is like this .
you &apos;re doing the mistakes now , and you pay a lot later .
and that &apos;s why the notion of having all kinds of problems , to invest in something that you have only later -- and that &apos;s the investment that is not so clear . in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst scenario and there are people
the fact is that this uncertainty should be worried about .
but my dream here is that if you can do economic , and the co2 is getting away , then the skeptics says , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not a carbon footprint , i wish it &apos;s not a carbon , i wish it &apos;s cheaper , but i
and that would be their answer to the most powerful argument that if you use all of these time and energy to solve the co2 problem , all the other goals that are suffering , the other goals that are affected by malaria and so on , is that it
so , the real estate rate : well , the actual spending for research -- let &apos;s say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than you &apos;re doing today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
it shouldn &apos;t suffer other things .
you get to large sums of money , and you can disagree with a reasonable person if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and tries to fund that . for me , most of the waste is the waste .
because it &apos;s very short , you &apos;re very short of a design , and they only funded the learning curve , and i think we should try to be more things that have a lot less expensive .
if the steam , you get a very high , very high , very high , very high , very high time .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times as much for our energy to change its energy .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even the more cosmopolitan thinks .
his new computer system is now , &quot; why don &apos;t research be more ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to be associated with his earlier stories , with the most advanced , but he understood that it &apos;s a very lonely group and therefore it &apos;s going to get the most profound group .
and that &apos;s a thought that i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , as little as a supporting .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking almost all the people here , if i say , i really hope you will be true . thank you very much .
rs : thank you .
a few years ago , at ted , peter mcchrystal hired a radio book called &quot; the &quot; the world &apos;s &quot; the &quot; the prison . &quot;
the idea is quite simple . the highest one needs to have the highest structure of the structure with 20 spaghetti , about three feet , about three feet , and build a marshmallow .
the marshmallow needs to be up .
and , although it really seems to be , it &apos;s really hard to do it , because it &apos;s very fast to work with people .
and so i thought that this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a very troubled way .
it was a huge success .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , engineers and architects , even with the most powerful of the food and there &apos;s something that makes deep impressions in nature and i want to share some of them .
usually most people start to get themselves to the task .
they &apos;re talking about how it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to look like it &apos;s going to be .
then you invest a little bit in planning and organization , and they put spaghetti .
they &apos;re investing in a lot of their time in the water community .
and finally , shortly before you don &apos;t have time , someone takes the marshmallow and they put it carefully on the top , step back , and &quot; look , &quot; they &apos;re going to be a step .
but then , almost always , it &apos;s going to happen , that the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; world &apos;s &quot; is going to be a &quot; the &quot; the &quot; eureka &quot; system , because the weight of the marshmallow is causing the whole
there &apos;s a series of people who have much more , more &quot; the &quot; free &quot; moments than others , and under the worst , fresh gas systems .
it &apos;s lying , they cheat , they &apos;re confused and they really make them really smart .
and of course , there are teams that have much more , more &quot; more &quot; and the best ones are fresh a lot of fresh graduate students .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter told us , they didn &apos;t just make the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is , how does this come from ? why ? what about those ?
and peter tells you , &quot; none of the kids spend a boss at the head of the spaghetti . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest at the time of time .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that &apos;s that the fact that the fact that the fact that the fact that we have a plan is to find a real plan , ok !
and then it &apos;s true .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar with what ?
what &apos;s different is that they start to start building the marshmallow and build prototypes , successfully , with the marshmallow on the top , so that they have a lot of the opportunity to repair the possibility of fixing prototypes .
and the way that they see these kinds of collaboration is that they &apos;re starting to see the core of a brain .
and with each attempt , the kids get feedback immediately , and what doesn &apos;t .
so the performance , with prototypes , is to work , but we see how different teams are acting .
average for most of the time is about the most of the time , and the average is half of it , but not much , but not much , more powerful than adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , luckily .
a meter is the highest thing i saw .
and why ? because you understand triangles and they &apos;re the key geometric patterns to build robust structures .
ceos are about average . but here &apos;s what it &apos;s interesting .
so , you put an environmental administrator on the team , you &apos;re significant better .
it &apos;s incredible . you see , and you see , &quot; this team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why is this ?
because they have special skills of the world &apos;s rights .
they &apos;re running the process , they understand it .
and this team , which is going to regulate and look at the work of the team , significantly better .
these are highly specialized skills and the other way to succeed .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six , which have robust structures .
i tried something interesting now .
i thought we &apos;re going to get the same thing in the same way .
so i offered a $ 10,000 prize to software for the winner .
what happened to these kinds of things ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if anyone had a high amount of construction , he would have carried the price home .
so is it not interesting that high levels of money have a strong effect ?
we repeated this exercise with the same students .
so what did you think happened ?
now they understood the advantage of &quot; prototyping . &quot;
so , from the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the lowest time .
so there &apos;s a lot of lessons for us , about nature , and success .
you might ask : why would someone actually invest a time to create a more powerful ?
the reason is , i help digital tools and processes to help teams , cars , video games and &quot; visual , &quot; to create .
and what the most important thing is , it &apos;s going to help you identify assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a common experience , a common language or attitude , to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this such kind of exercise .
and those of you who are interested in that can visit the street .
it &apos;s a blog where you see how you build the marshmallow .
there &apos;s a more mature there .
they find crazy examples of all the world , like people integrated the system and optimize it .
there are also also more sophisticated .
and the most important lesson i think is , i think , is a design sport .
it requires that we all have our senses to the task , and that we &apos;re thinking we &apos;re going to be thinking , we &apos;re going to be aware of how our emotions and our things are , in the challenge that we &apos;re going to be in front
and sometimes a little prototype of this experience is everything that takes us to take us from a &quot; a &quot; a &quot; a &quot; a &quot; a &quot; race . &quot;
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
so let &apos;s have a machine here .
a big machine , a cool machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room must be in .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t stay in here and now you &apos;re going to stay here .
and i wonder what they would choose because i &apos;ve been very often asked to ask my friends , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before they got cars or twitter or &quot; america &quot; to be the superstar .
i don &apos;t know .
i believe you &apos;re kind of drawn to nostalgia , and i &apos;m drawn to a handshake .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go into the past , and that &apos;s because i &apos;m a 404 biologist .
it &apos;s because opportunities don &apos;t go back to this planet , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that there were ever on the planet , no matter what scale you are doing : health , wealth , hope , opportunities , declining water .
there was never a time like this .
my favorite card was all passed as you were 60 .
my grandparents are pushing down to 70 .
my parents are the 80 on the top of the river .
so there should be better one nine at the beginning of my apartment .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
a child who can be born in new delhi today may expect to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is this ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;ve shaped the demographics of the earth in a way that has no war ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we &apos;ve failed them . wake up .
in the rich world , diseases that have millions of us only have a generation of us not even threatened .
so , the polio phone , polio , polio ...
anybody still knows what that is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try and try and look at , look , it &apos;s working , it changes if it doesn &apos;t work , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s the whole good news , because there &apos;s a couple of other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned often .
and one of them is that despite all of our achievements , a billion people are hungry in the world every day .
this number goes up , and it &apos;s very fast , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to trash this world .
drinking water , the country , rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear , and if we don &apos;t go out of this chaos , and we &apos;re not going to go out of this chaos .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the country that they live in to rape .
i think we can power the world with energy that they don &apos;t actually kill .
i think that really , and no , that &apos;s not a magic .
but this is holding me awake at night -- one of the things that sit awake at night . we &apos;ve never had to have a lot of it as well as we &apos;ve never been , yet , never , never , never , never , never , never
and we &apos;ve never been able to make it useful , as we can do today .
we &apos;re at the threshold of amazing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i think we have to go back hundreds , 300 years before the enlightenment to find a time , in which we have progress in progress , in which we have a lot of
people are going to convey to their belief , and that &apos;s how so close you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth will get free .
and listen , everybody has a right thing to think about , even a fairly right thing to believe .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
they don &apos;t have a right on their own facts . &apos; sorry , they don &apos;t have .
and i took a while to figure out that .
about a decade ago , i wrote a paper about algae for &quot; the new yorker , &quot; a small article .
and i was amazed to hit resistance , on resistance , which is the most effective power in health care in humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article and went on .
and soon i wrote a paper about genetically modified food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people were playing crazy .
so i also wrote a paper about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; , why they thought molecules were a certain kind of a random way of moving a random way to the field of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept doing it .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we type , we &apos;re going to eat , we eat , that &apos;s okay .
but this article made me worry , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and finally , i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these fellows who were crazy at all , they were not being angry .
these were the most educated people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like people in this room .
and that &apos;s what i got so mess .
but then i thought , you know what , be honest .
we &apos;re at one point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress as earlier .
we &apos;re talking about it .
we &apos;re talking about ironic , with little quotes , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reasons for that , and i think we know what reasons that are .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in the science , and there &apos;s no reason why it shouldn &apos;t be that way .
you can just call a few names and see people .
chernobyl , the copper banks , the sins , mass weapons , mass of water , the water .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people we believed they were always right . so are they skeptical .
imagine , ask , demand evidence , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything as they have .
but now , if you have to get evidence , you have to assume that evidence , and we &apos;re not good at that .
and i can tell that that we &apos;re now living in an epidemic of fear , as i &apos;ve never seen , and hopefully never see .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible story that the people who had the protests with the passengers , and the vaccine , and the vaccine was associated with .
very scary .
so , lots of studies were done to see if this was true .
so , lots of studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we believe in anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we think we &apos;re really feeling .
we don &apos;t believe in a cluster of documents from a computer that gives us data , and i understand that , i think , do all of it .
but you know what ?
the result of this was devastating .
catastrophic because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the doubling for aids is falling down .
this is a very important thing , and we should be ashamed .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happened is we could do that .
well , i understand that . i do .
because here &apos;s somebody who &apos;s got the passengers ?
has one ever seen anyone in the audience who &apos;s ever seen of taskrabbit ?
it &apos;s not very often happening .
it &apos;s not happening in this country , but shame , in the world , is the last year .
these are many deaths from 7,000 , 20 per hour .
but because this is not happening here , we can see it , and people like jenny can walk around and get messages from fear and floods from platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and you can do that because they &apos;re not connecting to cause and correlation .
you don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same .
and that &apos;s something that we need to learn , and that &apos;s very fast .
this guy was a hero , jonas luce .
he &apos;s born from one of the worst most successful people &apos;s worst .
no fear , no carbs , polio , boom .
the guy in the middle of the middle .
he &apos;s called paul doolikahn .
he &apos;s just developed a couple of other people &apos;s worth of time .
he can save the lives of the world &apos;s lives 500,000 , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
now , this is good , except that paul runs around and talking about vaccines and talking about how valuable they are , and that people should just stop complaining .
and that &apos;s what he actually says .
so paul is a terrorist .
if paul is speaking in a public science , he can &apos;t tell the children &apos;s children .
he gets calls at home because people like to tell him where their children are going to school .
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
you take them away , and the diseases go back , terrible diseases , and that &apos;s what happens .
we have now 18,000 now .
and that &apos;s going to be worse , and pretty soon , kids are going to die in this , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not just going to die from measles .
what about polio ? take this . why not ?
a little bit of a time ago , i wrote a couple of weeks ago , and i said i &apos;m a little too sharp .
nobody ever said that before .
she wouldn &apos;t vaccinate her child against polio , no case .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
we had no polio in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe he got up here today in lagos , and you &apos;re going to fly in a plane , and just go to los angeles , right now , he &apos;s about ohio .
and in a few hours , he lands and he &apos;s going to go and go to a car , and he comes to long beach , and he &apos;s going to visit one of these kind of one of these big things .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a devastating illness , and we don &apos;t know , because so the world works now .
this is the planet we live in . don &apos;t do that as if it &apos;s not .
we love to be able to track ourselves in lies . we love that .
do you all have your vitamins now ?
so , a little bit of a small , a little bit of a tree that helps you to take on .
i know that they did that because half americans are doing this every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative cure , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference , how often we find out that they &apos;re useless .
the data is all coming up .
they make their urine . they &apos;re almost never doing it .
this is okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i &apos;m going to give you a completely .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the drug industry .
we hate to be too strong , and we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and we should not . our health care system is the crap .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing , and it &apos;s not to us to get it .
so we go back to the way , and where do we walk ?
we &apos;re running into the arms of the food .
this is great . i love the most popular .
but you know , this is really a serious issue , because stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars for it .
and i have all kinds of little anecdotes here .
none of them -- the -- , was , was , &quot; -- i &apos;m not even sure what that is , but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s been a man . &quot;
and you know what ? if i say that , people are screaming , and say , &quot; what does it take you ? let &apos;s do people what they want .
so they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you have wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the health health system , saying , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to not accept the evidence of the experts , &quot; or some of the people who want to treat his patients with their patients .
if you go to this path , where and the magic of the point and the magic and science replace it , you get to a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they get to the south african reserve in south africa .
he brought 400,000 of his people to be in because he was in the red , and the red , and a lot more effective than antiretroviral drugs , we know that they can avoid the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of skilled deaths in a country that will be worse than any other of these disease .
so , please say , i don &apos;t want these things to have a consequence .
they have them . they always have them .
now , the most sophisticated epidemic that we &apos;re in is that this ridiculous struggle between the u.s. development range and the most powerful food .
this is a debate that &apos;s a debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
this is ideology , not science .
everything we eat , every single stroke , every branch of desalination , every pine interpretation , is changed by the people .
you know , there was no food in paradise .
there was no food force .
there was no food plan . we did all this .
we did it in the last 11,000 years .
and some of them has worked and they don &apos;t .
we &apos;re exhausted , which doesn &apos;t work .
now we can do it more specifically , and of course , we can do it . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people to expand millions of people , their lives .
don &apos;t you want to do that ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;re bending to be able to make food forward .
why do we do that ?
now , what i &apos;m constantly hearing is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , and we don &apos;t want to do huge fields with one thing that is wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want to have the seeds .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . we fix that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge amount of energy , but it &apos;s not science .
that &apos;s not to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , the same .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes he &apos;s not working and sometimes , but the idea that we shouldn &apos;t allow science to do their work , because we fear it &apos;s a real smile , and she &apos;s holding millions of people from the flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than in the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
adam . adam .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? genetically changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this kind of thing , like &quot; upwake . &quot;
&quot; upwake is something half a billion people eating . &quot;
it &apos;s about a potato .
it &apos;s just a bunch of calories . it &apos;s an abstraction .
it has no nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have any protein , and scientists are building all this right now .
and then people could eat the food and wouldn &apos;t be blind .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be a noun , but it would be nice .
and all i can say to this is why we &apos;re going to fight this ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask , why do we fight that ?
because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
it &apos;s not about moving genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our gravitational attraction , better food , better food , unique food .
it &apos;s not about rice &apos;s surface , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be the highest time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we do so far as we do , we &apos;re guilty of something that i think i don &apos;t want to be guilty , i &apos;m not guilty of , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description of what &apos;s happening here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy of our worthy , and we need to really stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might want to say , &quot; you still want to go into this ridiculous time machine and go to the future ? &quot;
anyway . i want to do that on every case .
now , in the present , you have an incredible opportunity , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can put this time on everything we want .
we can move them where we want to move them , and we will move them where we want .
we need to have these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go up into the time machine and go into the future , we &apos;re going to be happy to have that .
i know we can , and as far as it is , that &apos;s something that &apos;s going to need the world now .
thank you .
thank you .
i &apos;ve been interested in the most interested and a half , and it may seem strange that a magician is interested in it , because you look at it as i &apos;m a kind of deception that will be done to something that &apos;s going to be done for
in other words , sugar sugar has shown a measurable effect , which is the most important , and that &apos;s just because the person thinks what happens to her , is a more powerful or a kind of ... in the middle of the body , there &apos;s a
a deception is going to be something wrong because somebody is aware of it .
so we also understand each other , i want to show you a basic , simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that at least the 1950s has been in every single country for children .
i learned it from the most violent magic magic magic of the taj .
i &apos;m going to take it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain it .
so , look what happens .
the knife you can study , my hand , which you can study .
i &apos;m going to just hold the knife in my hand .
i &apos;m going back my sleeve .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears or out of him , i &apos;m just going to just get my wrist here .
and you can see that you can see that no time to move anything . as long as i &apos;m going to go , nothing can go into my sleeve or come out .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything is good , the knife would put off my bare physical magnetism .
it &apos;s actually so clear to his place that i can shake it without that knife .
nothing goes into my sleeve or comes out , no more , no more powerful . and you can study everything .
the book !
now , this is a trick i often have little kids who are interested in , because you can learn a lot about deception , if you look closely , even though it &apos;s a very simple trick .
probably a lot of you know in the room here in the room .
he &apos;s working like this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to make my wrist to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappears , or the results , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i &apos;m going to put my wrist is that it &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
in the moment , where i &apos;m going to tell you about my hand , so you &apos;re going to see it from back to the back , this finger , my processors , just where he was , in a position where he was so extended .
great trick ?
there &apos;s someone behind that , and there &apos;s no childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i &apos;m going to get a little bit of it , the fingers changes its position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you &apos;re not aware of the bottom , that there &apos;s only three fingers , because the mind and the way it works information is not one , one , two , three , but it looks
but this is not what it &apos;s really about , and then i open my hand .
of course , it &apos;s held there , but not by magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my spectacle , that &apos;s there .
and if i close my hand , the same thing happens by letting me go through this movement , that the fingers will be more and more comfortable .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
you can show your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what did this have to do with the design ?
a year or so , i read a study that really blew me right .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a scientist , and that &apos;s why i was an amazing thing for myself .
so , this is what it turns out , if you offer a placebo in the form of a white pill in the form of a brain , it &apos;s just a round , white pill , which has a particular effect .
but if you give the shape that you give the placebo , for example , in a smaller pill , and that blue color and a letter is actually reflected in the same way that it is actually measurable .
and that , although none of them are a pair of fish -- it &apos;s just sugar .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really bothers me .
but it turns out that it &apos;s not all .
if you take a rubber bar , you &apos;re more effective than a staff .
a colored capsule , which is yellow , and on the other red , is better than a white capsule .
and the dose is a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is ...
... that also plays a role .
and the shape is playing a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate consumer model , you have to reach to the needle .
right ? one syringe with a computer cap -- a few of the people who are being licensed with a patient .
this creates a very strong picture in the head . this is a lot stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i &apos;m going to show you another time , if we have a projection .
so the fact is that the white pill doesn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill that doesn &apos;t work as well as a capsule that doesn &apos;t work as well as the needle .
and none of them have really been a very sophisticated property . it &apos;s just our belief that we have in our own , stronger impact .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick .
i &apos;m taking something that &apos;s obvious , and i &apos;m going to make it look really .
we know that we have to reach out of the study , if you want to reach to the needle .
this is a long time of long time , and it &apos;s very , very rigid . and i &apos;m going to first leave you a little bit of plastic .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not a very crappy meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick this needle into my skin , and it &apos;s going through it , until you cast it back on the other side .
if you &apos;re going to fall , if you drop lightly in your dive -- i showed you a few friends last night in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and i have a woman who &apos;s almost powerless .
so i &apos;m going to propose , if you &apos;re very good , you &apos;ll look at the next 30 seconds , or , you know , i &apos;ll make the first spiritual part here .
you can see it right , but you can also see it , if you want .
so , it &apos;s like , right here , where my meat starts , at the bottom of my arm , i just make a little barbs .
i &apos;m really sorry . does it make it crazy ?
and now just a little bit of my skin and on the other side , it &apos;s just coming out .
now we &apos;re in the same situation that we had in the same way .
about .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well , well .
i know what people think if they see this .
they say , &quot; okay , it &apos;s not that dumb and it &apos;s not so dumb , and it &apos;s just to give us a few minutes for a few minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;ll show you .
how does this look like ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and people go to the back , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t see that right . &quot;
people in the world &apos;s kitchen show are now occurring in .
let me show you the way that i &apos;m close to them .
this is really my skin . this is not a special effect of hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can reverse that .
sorry . if you &apos;re getting nasty , you can see it not .
people back , or the back that later look at video , will say , &quot; well , that &apos;s pretty impressive , but if it was real , it would be a hole , and it would be like , you know , there &apos;s a hole , it
okay , let me just give you a little blood for you .
yeah , here it is .
now , i would take the needle now .
i would clean my arm and show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this frame here , and with the intent of a piece of deception , i &apos;m going to just leave the needle in there , and so i &apos;m going to go from the stage .
we &apos;re going to meet a couple of times in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re happy for that . thank you .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i have a few people counting the number of books that were published with happiness in the last five years , and they gave them about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest among researchers under researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of more sophisticated .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these tide of work , there are several cognitive sharks that are kind of impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mainly taken by these cognitive ones .
it &apos;s true for contemporary development , which is about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness because it turns out that we are just like that mess .
the first of these risks is a very empowering complexity , an obsession .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a useful word , because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could easily narrow it , but in the big and all the way , that &apos;s something that we need to give up , and we will have to take the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is a pity of experience and memory : in fact , it &apos;s between happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both the most powerful ones in the mind of happiness .
and the third is the most important thing , and that &apos;s the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that affects well-being without changing its meaning .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now i &apos;d like to start with one example of someone who had a kind of a school story for one of my lectures , who said a story . &#91; unclear &#93; he said he &apos;d heard a symphony , and it was absolutely gorgeous music , and it
and then he added , really quite emotionally , which has ruined the whole experience .
but that didn &apos;t have it .
what it has ruined was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had had a little bit of music for 20 minutes .
they &apos;re not talking about because he was a memory of memory ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all that he had to keep .
what &apos;s really telling us that we could think about ourselves and about other people thinking about the senses of two species of self .
there &apos;s a more powerful self living in the present , and the present knows , can be able to experience the past , but basically the present .
it &apos;s the most important self , the doctor &apos;s doctor -- you know , if the doctor asks , &quot; do you hurt it now if i &apos;m going to get you here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a more powerful self , and the most important self is that , the most important and the history of our life can be upright , and it &apos;s going to be that the doctor is going to be a question , &quot; how did you
or &quot; how did your journey be in albania ? &quot; or so .
these are two very different units , the most important selves , the most powerful self , and the two to confuse the two is part of the world &apos;s brain &apos;s happiness .
well , the most important self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it &apos;s beginning to start .
we don &apos;t just tell stories when we do to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories that we can keep from our experiences to the other of our experiences .
and let &apos;s start with an example .
there &apos;s a old study .
these are real patients that put themselves painful .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s not painful today , but it was painful than this study was done in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds of pain .
and here are two patients . these are their records .
and they &apos;re asked , &quot; who &apos;s got more ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
patient b clearly had more suffered . his favorite , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much did these patients think that they suffered ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a much worse car rate had a much worse job of the water .
the stories of the world &apos;s brain were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how they end up .
and not that stories is very , very highly competent or great -- but one of them is that clear ...
but one of them is more than the other .
and the ones that &apos;s worse was where the pain was very , very close to his peak . it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people to their own , and also , much later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing in total ? &quot;
and she was much worse for a than for b in the prison industry .
well , this is a direct conflict between the self self and the most of the time .
from the point of view of the computer self , b had a more successful time .
now , what you could do with patient a do , and we actually did clinical experiments , and it &apos;s been done , and it works , and it &apos;s actually going to work the most sophisticated of the patient by just putting the tube inside it without too
that &apos;s going to lead the patient , but only a little bit less than before .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you can make that the most powerful self is a bad thing , and you have that that the average self is a much better way of being a bit better , because now you have patient a better story
so , what is a story ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that gives us memory and it &apos;s true for the stories that we invent .
and what a story is is , it &apos;s a profound component , significant moments and end .
end , very , very important and in this case , the dominated the end .
well , the most important self lives forever .
it has moments of the most of the time , one after the other .
and they ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re always lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i have this -- you know , the psychological presence is about three seconds . what means , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them in a month , and there &apos;s about 600,000 million of them
most of you will completely ignore the oil &apos;s self .
and yet , you get the impression that you should count that what &apos;s happening during this moments of the world &apos;s life is our lives .
it &apos;s the limited resource we use as we are on the world .
and as we would use them , it &apos;s not the story , but that &apos;s not the story that keeps the most powerful self for us .
so we have the most powerful self , and the most important self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between you is the time .
from the point of view of the day , if you have a vacation and the second week is just as good as the first , then the most powerful vacation is twice as good as the passenger vacation .
this is not how it works at all , for the most fundamental self .
for the most important time , a holiday is barely better than the passenger vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories of the car .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical variable , which is a different kind of a social self that &apos;s different from a kind of a car . time has a very little influence on this story .
well , the most important self is making more , and to tell stories .
it &apos;s actually the power that &apos;s going to be able to make decisions , because if you have a patient who , say , two different surgeons , and decide what he should choose , then the one who is choosing , is that the one who is the
the most important self has no voice in this choice .
actually , we don &apos;t choose between verbal experiences , and we choose between memories .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future as an experience .
we think about our future as a result of the human future .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the brain itself , and you can think of the most important self as one , which kind of the most important self , which is not the most important thing that &apos;s going
i have the impression that if we &apos;re doing a vacation , it &apos;s a very often , which is , we &apos;re doing vacation in the service of the ocean itself .
and that &apos;s a little bit hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much are we from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that will be given for the dominance of the ocean itself .
and when i think about it , i think that a vacation we did a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best vacation i had ever had , and i think i &apos;m relatively often in the relationship to how often i think of other people
and i probably have this kind of my memories of this kind of thing , i would say about 25 minutes long in the last four years .
now , if i had opened the folder with 600 images , i had a more hour .
well , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s just a half hours .
there seems to be an disagreement .
now , i like a little extreme , you know , how little i have on the top of the memories of memories , but even if you &apos;re doing more of it , why do we give up memories of the weight of the weight that we give the
so i want you to think about a thought of thinking about this .
imagine your next holiday , you know that at the end of the mountain , all of your pictures are being wiped out , and you get a drug , so that you &apos;re not going to remember anything .
now , would you choose the same holiday ?
and if you choose a different holiday , there &apos;s a conflict between your two species of self and you have to think about how they decide this conflict and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think of the way of the mind , you can get
why we choose the most sophisticated , which is a problem that is a problem that is going to be in a choice between the two species of self .
now , the two types of self , two terms of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can apply to one of the selves .
so you can ask questions : how happy is the most important self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments of the life of the self ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
which is the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea of happiness from the most exciting self .
if you &apos;re lucky to ask yourself , it &apos;s a very different thing .
it &apos;s not how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or pleased the person is , if these person think about their lives .
very different term .
and everyone who &apos;s not going to negotiate this terms is the study of happiness , and i &apos;m in a lot of researchers about well-being that have been fed in the study of happiness for a long time .
the distinction between happiness itself and happiness is recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re going to be concerned about measuring both these displaced ones .
the gallup organization has a worldwide survey , which has been asked more than half a million people , and they &apos;ve been asking about what they think about their lives and their experiences . and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started learning about the happiness of the two species .
and the main lesson we think i think is really different is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and it &apos;s really not that much about how happy he lives , and the other thing that &apos;s happy .
just to give you a sense of the correlation that is about the relationship , about the relationship .
what that means is that if you would meet someone and you would tell you , oh , his father is a very , you know , how much would you know about his size ?
well , you would know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that someone &apos;s life as eight on a scale have 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he is with his own self .
so correlation is low .
we know something about what happiness is defined by the most of the time .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know happiness is mostly meant to be happy with people that we like to spend time with people that we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so if you want to maximize the most of the two species of self , you &apos;re going to do very different things .
the conclusion of what i said here is that we really shouldn &apos;t imagine ourselves as a replacement for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , very quickly , another reason we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things when we think about life , and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people are in california , they don &apos;t get the correct answer .
if you ask this question , you think that people in california must be happier if they say , in ohio , we &apos;re living in ohio .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important for the most important self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the ambitious self , which decides how happy people are .
but , because the symptom itself is responsible , you can go to the end -- some people could go to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to track what happens to people who go to california , happier .
well , your favorite self is not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;re going to think that you &apos;re happier , because if you &apos;re going to think about it , you &apos;re going to be reminded how awful the weather was in ohio , and you &apos;ll feel that you &apos;ve got
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i have a sense of what it &apos;s like to be difficult .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we talked about a couple weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting result that came out of this gallup survey .
is that something you can let us connect , because you have a few minutes left ?
daniel libeskind : sure .
i think the most interesting result we found in the gallup survey is a number that we didn &apos;t expect to find absolutely not .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
when we looked at how feelings vary with income .
and it turns out that under a income income , for americans , and this is a very big sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample , under a income of 600,000 dollars a year in a year of 600,000 dollars a year
60,000 .
so , 60,000 : 60,000 .
60,000 dollars a year are unhappy , and they become increasingly happy , the poorer they will be .
we get a perfectly flat line .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen so flat lines .
what happens is obviously that money doesn &apos;t buy a single basketball thing , but that lack of money certainly pays misery , and we can actually measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the most of the time , you get another story .
the more money you deserve is the more likely you .
it &apos;s not true for emotions .
but danny , in the entire american effort , it &apos;s about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people take this kind of fancy seriously , i mean , it seems to be all on the head , everything we believe in terms of , for example , in terms of the world &apos;s and so on .
is there a chance that politicians , the country generally would take a more powerful way to take the serious , and based on politics ?
so , you know , you know , i think there are recognition for the role of the brain in politics .
the recognition will be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the u.k. , it &apos;s happening and in other countries , they just happen .
people are in favor that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a while , and people will discuss whether they want to study the way or whether they want to study the argument , so we have to have this discussion quite soon .
how to make happiness is very different about how you think and whether you think about the most important self or whether you think about the most important self .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the next years .
in the united states , you &apos;re going to be able to measure the population of the population .
this is going to be , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistic .
well , it seems to me , this topic , or should be the most interesting political debate to track the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny ornish .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i design video games .
i &apos;ve been developing for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy to save the world in reality , as you &apos;re to save in the world &apos;s lab .
i have a plan for this . i want to convince you more people , including to spend more time with the play of greater and more and more of them .
now we spend three billion hours a week with a week .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much time when you think of how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research at the institute of the future is to open the opposite .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solve the most expensive problems of the world .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increase this time dramatically .
i was measuring that the time it &apos;s taken at 21 billion hours per week .
this may be a bit of a symbolic , so i &apos;ll take it to it , so that if we &apos;re problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflicts , and obesity , i think , we need to play games online for at least 21
no , i really do mean it .
why ? this picture is quite precisely why i think games are so critical for survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a portrait of photographer phil cousteau .
he wanted to catch the feelings of play . so he &apos;s got a camera built on the players .
this is one of the classic expressions of play .
if you don &apos;t have a player , you may be able to get some of the nuances in this picture .
you probably see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also , very hard concentration , all of a sudden , really , really difficult to solve .
if you &apos;re playing , you see some nuances here , which is the top of the eyes and the mouth of the optimism , and the eyebrows show a sign of optimism .
this is a player who &apos;s called the epic epic ball .
oh , you know that . ok . so , so we have some players here .
a replica victory is a result that is so powerful that it &apos;s not at all before , that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you reach it , they &apos;re shocked that they &apos;re actually capable of doing something like this . that &apos;s a kind of a hippie victory .
this player is a very short victory in front of a epic victory .
and this is what we have to see on millions of faces from the world &apos;s face , if we take the barriers of the next century to attack the next century , the face of the face of a epic web .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re looking at this face in real life , if we &apos;re going to meet hard problems .
i call it a bad life in life , and i &apos;m really bad , and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? ok ? ok .
this is me , as i am in life , i &apos;m doing bad &quot; in life . &quot;
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i studied in my ph.d. and we &apos;re doing better than in the real life .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not so good in reality as in games .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though it &apos;s going to be .
we &apos;re going to get more in the field of science . i mean , i &apos;m doing a lot of the way to do the motivation , something more shocking to the people .
if we &apos;re in a corporate field , i believe that many of us are turning in our best version , anytime , and immediately helpful , the problem is to try to solve it , so long as necessary as necessary , it &apos;s going to try to take
and in reality , if we fail to occur , we feel often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or abstracted .
and we &apos;ve never got these feelings , if we play games , they &apos;re just not .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a graduate student .
why is it impossible to think about it , to think , you can &apos;t just do anything ?
how can we actually use these feelings from play into reality ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , which offers the ideal environment to the individual problem .
and i found some things that the epic wins in the middle of the window .
so first , if you &apos;re going to get in one of these online , especially in the world of warcraft , there &apos;s a lot of different characters that are willing to give you a design mission , and that &apos;s immediately .
but not only any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your current level in the game , right ?
so they do that .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t solve .
but always at the edge of your capabilities , you have to work . but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and spin , and it &apos;s all about doing something important .
and there are plenty of staff .
where they &apos;re also going , hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to finish their epic mission .
we don &apos;t have that easy life in the true life that &apos;s in a sense of a high , very small , very small thing .
and also , there &apos;s this epic story , these inspiring history , why we are and what we have to do .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve probably heard from level &quot; level &quot; and &quot; + 1 &quot; or &quot; + 1 intelligence . &quot;
this constant feedback is not true in life .
if i leave this stage , i don &apos;t have a talk : + 1 , and a crazy idea , + 20 kooks .
i don &apos;t get the real life of this feedback .
so the problem of the world &apos;s design as the world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so satisfying anytime at the edge of a epic ball of light that we prefer to spend our whole time in these online cases .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
until today , all the world of the world &apos;s world &apos;s population has spent millions of years to solve the virtual problems of the world &apos;s .
that &apos;s not necessarily something bad .
it may sound nasty .
but to see it in the context of the context of the past , the first one of the millions of years began to go upright .
so the first nearby primate .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend with play , it just makes sense when you &apos;re in terms of the time of the human development of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also , it &apos;s true , because it turns out we &apos;re using all this time to play the whole time , actually , what we &apos;re able to do as people in the position .
we &apos;re developing collaborative thinking , and i think , very creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i think .
so , look at this interesting statistic that recently was published by a researcher of carnegie mellon university : the average boy of today in a country with huge amounts of food spending for the 21st of the year of 21 to the 21st of 21 hours .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number of reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , they &apos;re the exact same amount of freedom that they spend in school , from the five grade to the degree of high school -- if you never missed .
so we have a complete amount of paper , on the young people , which means what it means to be a good player , like everything else you learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of malcolm gladwell , &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; , read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of the 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of the world &apos;s research that if we spend 10,000 hours with the conversation of a single subject to the 21st of the matter , we &apos;ll be able to master .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what &apos;s the most important people in the world .
so , what we have here is a complete generation of young people who are the most prolific .
so the big question is , &quot; what exactly is players driving up ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would have never been able to get rid of human potential .
so many people are currently in the world , at least one hour a day with a child age .
these are our main programs . 500 million people who are extraordinary in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion players that are extraordinary at whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet .
the most sophisticated food industry is growing , saving energy and work on the ground , rather than the root of the world , so that players , especially in india , can play in india , china , brazil online .
you would expect a more billion player in the next decade .
so we &apos;ve got 1.5 billion players in the whole way .
so i started thinking about what it is to do to the task of the games .
here are the four things i found . first , the first thing : &quot; s . &quot;
ok , imagine the extreme amount of water .
so , the desire is to do something to do immediately , to be able to master a barrier , to believe that we have an educated hope on success .
players always believe that a more powerful victory is possible , and it &apos;s always worth trying to try and try and do it .
players don &apos;t sit around .
players are masters in spiders in spiders .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that show people that we like to do with them , after we &apos;ve been able to have defeated them , even if they &apos;ve defeated us .
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone a game .
we trust that somebody spend time with us that the rules are being celebrated , that we have the same goal and to the end of the way .
so the most important thing that &apos;s going to do is to grow the bonds , trust and each other .
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
it &apos;s great productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the most popular of the ted group of 22 hours a week is , as a result , a lot of the time .
the reason is , if we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than we &apos;re going to relax or nothing .
we know that as human beings , we &apos;re going to work with the human beings , if we do hard , significant work .
and players are always ready to work hard if they get the right task .
and finally , the epic meaning .
players love to be part of awe of the transformative mission of the same .
here &apos;s a computer project to put that in the right light , and you know all wikipedia , the largest wiki of the world .
the second roman rainbow in the world , with nearly 80,000 tweets is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
they &apos;ve been drawn more information across the world of warcraft in the internet than any other topic in each other &apos;s other other other other other other other other .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , so these are four superpowers that lead to one single outcome , and players are more sensitive , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe that they can change the world as a single one .
and the only problem is that you believe you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real .
that &apos;s the problem i try to solve .
edward ornish : a video is a design .
his work is great . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in the food store .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re not going to find a lot less than a more than a more than a single of the world &apos;s world . &quot;
and that &apos;s an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
and he says ...
not like i &apos;m developing -- i &apos;m developing games , i &apos;m a little bit more nuanced .
so he says that it actually makes sense , because players can reach more than in the real life .
you can make a stronger social bond in play as in real life , and you get more feedback and rewards in play as in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s right now , that players are spending more time in the virtual world than in the real world .
i just agree that it &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not a trivial problem .
we need to start turning the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from one event , which is about 2,500 years ago .
there are these ancient cube , from the book of the book . you know ?
this amazing ted project was the most amazing thing .
and that was kind of the first of all of people developed .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient greek , you may know this story . the story about how and why games were invented .
according to the sound of the team , games were used to be more accurate , in the kingdom of famine , as a famine .
and he was supposed to be such a great famine that the king of the king of the king of the king was a crazy idea .
people suffered . people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to the most popular , the most popular and chief , a national strategy , and one day , you would eat food . the next day you would play play .
and they would be so much in the way that they were so fascinating , and they &apos;re so fascinating and we &apos;re going to be surrounded by the , they &apos;re surrounded by the food , they were forgotten that there were nothing to eat .
and then the next day , you would play . and the next day you would eat food .
and according to that , they survived this famine for 18 years , and they were eating famine by eating a day .
so , i think , let &apos;s play a play today .
we &apos;re putting games to be the real world of the real world .
we &apos;re putting games to get everything to be able to get in the real world , everything in the real world , and we &apos;re not doing that , and we &apos;re going to take us out of the play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting .
according to 18 years old , famine didn &apos;t get the famine better , so the king , a last school professor .
they shared the kingdom in two camps .
they were playing a computer bank and they were allowed to break up a epic adventure .
they left out and they went to search for a new home , and they just decided to go back so many people like food and searching with the rest of the world , and they were able to thrive with the rest of the site .
that sounds crazy , right ?
but recent research shows that the most important thing that the emergency room was coming up with later the palm empire that the same dna is like the old .
so scientists recently came to the notion that the crazy story is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global cooling system that was almost 20 years ago , which was the famine to explain .
so this crazy story could voices .
you may have saved your people through play by killing 18 years in games and then they had the same thing that they &apos;ve been using , and they &apos;ve learned so much about the whole civilization .
so , we can also .
we &apos;ve been playing in 1994 since 1994 .
this was the first thing in real time the world of the world &apos;s world &apos;s first time , that was 16 years ago .
they were playing 18 years for 18 years , we &apos;ve been warcraft for 16 years .
i &apos;m saying , we &apos;re ready for our own brain game .
so , they sent half their civilization to search for a new world , so i &apos;m going to take my 21 billion of these dollars a week .
we should be able to have a lot of that in a day that half of us spend a day with play , until we solved the problems of real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of real world in games ? &quot; and that question i &apos;ve been doing in the last few years , the last few years , i &apos;ve spent the future for the future .
we have this flag in our office in palo alto , it &apos;s going to press how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to think of the best outcome , and then people deserve to make this idea in reality .
we take the epic mate and give people the possibilities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you a little bit about three games that i designed to try to take people to the epic future in their own future .
this is &quot; the world without oil . &quot;
the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s a very important thing that you have to get through a computer scanner .
the key thing is , what is the way that we have a lot of energy , but we have enough food systems so that it &apos;s realistic for you , and you actually live without oil , so if you &apos;re going to sign up to your game ,
we tested this game with logos in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been joining them since the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a change experience .
nobody wants to change his life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a epic adventure , and you &apos;re going to get , &quot; we &apos;re going to go from oil . &quot;
this is a fascinating adventure that you &apos;re going to go to .
find out how they were going to survive . most of our players have reduced the play of their behavior .
so we have a bigger game for the next ted game , and we put a bigger , higher goal than just a drug .
we &apos;ve developed the game &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; institute for the future .
the point is computation of a nuclear field that people have only 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputer is called &quot; global warming , &quot; of course .
the call to player , we have a lot of design , we &apos;re almost designed as a &quot; a &quot; &quot; a &quot; design system .
you know jerry &apos;s , where it &apos;s called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; world &apos;s &quot; -- they have the astronauts , the
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody is in the business room , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 players played the game for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when they &apos;re &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; system .
and the last game we get on the third of march , it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you finish the game , you get the award of the world bank , &quot; social health , &quot; early in 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in all sub-saharan africa and store , social design .
we have a comic book . we have &quot; level high &quot; for the design of the world , sustainability , sustainability , vision and genius .
i want to invite you all to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in the world , especially in the world , to help them to get their own social enterprise to save the world .
i &apos;ll come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the world yet .
well , i hope that you agree that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we have all these superpowers , the productivity of productivity , the ability to engage very close social nets , and the desire to be able to make the difference .
i really hope that we play together meaningful games to survive on this planet , one more century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to play with me like this and play .
if i go to the next decade , i &apos;m sure that we can make any other future , and that we can all play the future , and we can play all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start playing the video games .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about what i was writing about a couple months ago in writing a article for the ted magazine magazine .
i always sat in writing my favorite day , but i was with the writing of text , and i noticed that i &apos;ve never been in my life , which is &quot; disabled &quot; really .
i read them the post .
&quot; disabled , &quot; most frequently , &quot; the fuck , helpless , useless , destroyed , mutilated , mutilated , firemen , nirvana , bleeding , bleeding , rigid , rigid , rigid , rigid , rigid , rigid , rigid , breathing , breathing , breathing , rigid
and the point is healthy , strong , powerful . &quot;
i &apos;ve read this list of a friend according to a friend , and i had to laugh , it worked so ridiculous , but i just came up to &quot; cala &quot; and i had to get to read and get to the end of the world &apos;s emotional
of course , this was a very important old , old , old , and i thought that the copy of the question must be quite old .
but in fact , it was a copy of the early 1980s when i started elementary school , and i started to build my self outside my family &apos;s brain , and to form it in terms of other kids and to the rest of the world around me .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use a nuclear drum .
i would be taking this shot seriously , i would be born in a world that someone like me would perceive as a person who could be positive in any way , but today i &apos;m going to be able to be celebrated for the opportunity and adventure that i
so i immediately said the most uplifting thing about 2009 , and i expected to find a lot of work here .
here &apos;s the most profound version of this mountain .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in particular , the last two words in the near , in the near , &quot; close &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these values .
our language affects our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
many ancient societies , including the greeks and the roman , really believed that the ambulance one of a major force has a big force because what you &apos;re looking at is what you &apos;re looking at , also , to exhibit .
so , what do we actually want to visualize -- a disabled person or a powerful person ?
and just a human being to call a child , it could be done , and they could do it and they &apos;re going to be able to do ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open you doors ?
a human being opened for me was my pediatrician at the top of the house , and my pediatrician at the top of the house was in the hospital house .
he &apos;s called dr. strangelove . a name , whose name , as you can think of , most americans couldn &apos;t do properly . so he always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. always wore very colorful flies and was just designed for the work with kids like this .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital , just great -- until my favorite .
i had to repeat the work , and i would be repeat with this big elastic , elastic , different colors -- that you know , to build my favorite , and i hated this tape tape , and i hated it . i hated her . i hated her
and imagine , i even have a child &apos;s worth of child negotiate with dr. p. , and so tried to stop this practice , not success .
and one day he looked at me at one of my own work -- these things were just tiring and shopping boats -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re a little bit of a snake , powerful and young girl , you &apos;ll
and if you can make it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
this was just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i &apos;m doing the work that i didn &apos;t want to do with the prospect that richest five girls in the hospital in the second stick is going to be a new , and it was actually brought me
and i &apos;m asking myself to be a lot of vision as a powerful and powerful young girl , my self , and i could imagine that as a nature of powerful , powerful and powerful human beings .
this is just one example of many , like adults in the foreign community , who can encourage the imagination of a child .
but as the result of the world &apos;s population , we &apos;re not going to give us a room , and we don &apos;t make a room to imagine what we all would wish to do : it &apos;s all to allow us to see ourselves as a powerful person
our language is beyond the social changes that has been caused in many cases of technology .
of course , from the medical standpoint , you can say that my legs , the most sophisticated , the most powerful for the food system , of titan and artificial , is for aging , to use all of their possibilities and to define the limits of the limits
so perhaps this technological change is clear because ever , there &apos;s always a different truth , which is that every human society is a little bit more powerful and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt to it is our biggest plus .
the human ability to adapt , this is an interesting story , because people always ask me about how i deal with mastery and i &apos;ll give you something like this : this sentence has never been kept for me and i &apos;ve been very uncomfortable with this , and
this sentence of the odds of the idea that success or happiness depends on the challenge of being able to master , without being able to be connected by the experience of the experience , as if my life could be so successful , or as well as people fall
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course we &apos;re a challenge of whether they &apos;re physically , emotionally or even both of them .
and i &apos;m saying that it &apos;s good .
odds are not obstacle that we need to be able to get to our lives better with our lives .
odds are just to our lives .
and i tend to get to be able to get to the odds of my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he &apos;s very present , sometimes he &apos;s not to see it , but he &apos;s always at me .
and i &apos;m not going to want to have the impact of the impact of a human being .
there are challenges in life and challenges , and they &apos;re only the real estate and all the person who are going to be different , but the question is , if we come to odds , or not , we &apos;re going to be clear .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for people that we love to preserve , but they also prepare to get good with it .
and we don &apos;t really turn to our kids if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you have to separate two things : one of the medical fact , to be persuaded and to be the other social opinion , whether i am disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only real and permanent disability i had to put apart is that the world is constantly known , and that &apos;s what the world is saying .
in our desire , the people who are protecting us , and they &apos;re the cold , hard truth about their medical occupation or even to ask a forecast of life that they would expect , we have to take a look at that , we &apos;re not going to
maybe this is the concept that &apos;s just looking at what &apos;s broken in a broken , and how we fix it , for every single disability as the family division .
if we don &apos;t treat a human being , and not all of its forces and opportunities and realizing , we can do it in addition to natural struggle that you might have to have another disease .
we &apos;re going to have a human being that has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the world &apos;s data and focus on all the human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between perception of our flaws and our great , very connection , there &apos;s a connection .
we should not be able to fail to deny or deny , we should not try to avoid them , even should we be able to avoid them under the carpet , but it &apos;s about to recognize the odds .
it may be about asking me to make sure that we don &apos;t necessarily need to get rid of odds , but that we &apos;re open to it , to give you a hug , to put it on the most friendly to be able to put a more mature
and maybe we can do it , and you can see , as a slightly natural , fuzzy and useful and feel like that , and we don &apos;t feel so much as it is .
in this year , we celebrate 200 . the birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , in my eyes , has been shown in my eyes .
i would be so used to use it , not the most powerful of its kind of survival , and not the most powerful of its species , but the one who can adapt to the best .
it &apos;s common from conflicts .
not only know from darwin &apos;s work , we know that the ability to survive and survive , from the fight of human mind is to transform through conflict .
so again , change and customization are the greatest skills of human beings .
and maybe we know what wood is in , when we &apos;re really tested .
perhaps that &apos;s the point of odds , an emotion of the speakers , a sense of our own power .
we can give ourselves something like that .
we can give mastery of a new meaning that goes beyond severe times .
maybe we can see odds as change .
odds are for change that we haven &apos;t adapted to .
i think the biggest damage we &apos;ve been able to do ourselves is to believe that we should be normal .
so honestly -- who is normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual . the usual thing . but not the normal thing , and would you really want to know these poor gray , gray person , if they really would be ?
i think it &apos;s not .
it would be great if we &apos;re doing this paradigm of the normal versus a different of the possibilities or the strength to even make it a little more dangerous , exchange the forces of very many children , and invite them to bring their special and valuable skills into
and the point of research , we found that we have people from our society always have to have been an idea : useful to be useful and a contribution .
there are evidence that the neanderthals have been in front of 60,000 people and people with heavy physical injuries , and that might have been because the life life in the world &apos;s life of these people was valuable : the life of the society .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went to town in the city i grew up in a hot zone in the &quot; red zone &quot; in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there a very recently tomato tomato unit .
it was summer and i had a lot of time .
and i hear how a guy behind me says , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not aimee mullins . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to move around and see this older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; excuse me , sir , we know we can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you may not remember me .
when i first saw her , i took her out of her mother &apos;s belly . &quot;
oh , so that .
and then , of course , it &apos;s made click .
this was dr. strangelove , a man i knew only from narratives of my mother , because of course i was , of course , in the very typical , to my birthday two weeks late .
the doctor for the ted partner of my mother was in vacation , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world at all .
and because i was born without a throwaway , and my feet were looking at them , and i just had a few toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , and he had the most profound news to the rest of the world .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell you that you would never walk , and never would be so mobile , and you would never be able to live a more independent life , and you &apos;ve just got to lie to me . &quot;
i was really extraordinary that he had collected my entire childhood , whether i had won in a second class in the second grade , whether i was on the top of the house of the day , whether i was on the top of the ted school , and
and he called this part of his course of his course , the x factor of the human challenge .
you can &apos;t emphasize enough , as the result of the life of a human being can be .
and dr. gore &apos;s continued told , he said , &quot; i learned that kids , if they &apos;re not going to get anything else , and even if they get a little bit of support , they can get a lot of work out , and then they can
see , dr. gore &apos;s experience has changed .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone deals with it , are two different things .
and i also changed my thinking in time when you had asked me to be asked by 15 years , if i had been talking to my prostheses against legs and bones , and i would have no question .
i was really trying to do it as normal .
if you ask me that , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve experienced something with my legs , and not despite that experience .
and maybe this change could happen , because i &apos;m so many people who opened up doors , rather than to meet people who were being quoted or to me a notion .
see , it really takes a human , which shows you how you can manifest your forces , and you &apos;re through .
if you allow someone to turn their own inner , inside , the human mind is so much so powerful -- if you can do that , and for somebody in a critical moment , they &apos;re a very good teacher .
they &apos;re bringing them to open themselves .
the real meaning of the word &quot; the &quot; vice versa &quot; in the word &quot; the &quot; &quot;
it means something that is in one is the potential of the opportunity .
again , what potential is we going to do now ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the u.k. , in the u.k. , a case was done , and then we &apos;ve turned out to be transformed in the u.k.
they call this &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; in the united states , we call this &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; system .
the students are divided up .
and the one student will be tested harder , get the better teachers , etc .
they have been given a lot of time to have a lot of the students who have been very good at a &quot; sufficient &quot; -- they said , &quot; well , they &apos;re a lot of good , they &apos;re very smart , and they really wrote them .
and of course , it breaks into listening to the heart that the opposite of the brain was said that the opposite is the most powerful thing .
and it was the same one that was the three months .
but only those who were still in school -- except by students who had been sweating .
so , very crucial at this study , the teachers were not going to be the same .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
and they just said that the death row and they &apos;re the students with the grade , and they &apos;re taught to give them something and they treat them .
the only real disability is a broken mind , which was broken , has no hope , has no hope , and he doesn &apos;t find any more of the time of our natural , spontaneous , and our innate ability of imagination .
but if we can do it , the human mind is going to continue to be hoping to be able to find yourself and other people around it , and to be nice and then we &apos;re going to be able to make our forces really positive .
if a mind has a mind about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new organizational process .
i want to end up with a poem that was written by an persian poet called the &quot; president of mine , &quot; and that was called my friend jacques &apos;s book , and the poem is called &quot; the god , who knows only four words , not the
come on , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than you &apos;re right now ?
suppose i said , by a few changes of their genes , a better memory could have -- more precise , more accurate and faster .
or you want to be more powerful , more powerful , more force .
do you want to become more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be to live longer in good health ?
or maybe they &apos;re one of those who are always motivated to do more creativity .
what would you like most ?
what would you like to have if you could just have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about so many as many as many as creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would be deciding for a good memory ?
a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . the majority i like to do , as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a different world .
is that all the kind of fantasy ?
or is it possible ?
evolution is a mysterious topic here on the ted conference , but today i want to give you the point of a doctor &apos;s subject .
the big geneticists in the 20th century , the most powerful , the most powerful in the russian greek church , wrote a paper called &quot; nothing in biology doesn &apos;t make sense except in the biology of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who don &apos;t accept the evidence of the biological evolution , this would be a very good time , you take your personal experience -- i &apos;ll give you your personal version -- i &apos;ll give you permission -- and maybe you
but if you accept biological evolution , you think about this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it for other people or is it also true ?
this is another view on the tree of life .
in this picture , i have a bush as a center of the branches in all directions , because if you look at the edges of life , all the existing species of life have been successful in evolutionary terms , success : they have survived ; it has survived
the human part of this , the very end of this , is , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in .
we recover from a shared ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this period , maybe there was 20 or 25 different species of hominids .
some are come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about the years .
it seems like we &apos;re right from the other parts of the tree of life , but actually , in the largest part , the basic mechanisms are our cells quite right .
so , you know , we can take it out of that and we can make the mechanisms of a common bacterium to produce the protein of the human genome , which is used to treat the calcium ?
this is not like the internet , this is the same protein that &apos;s made of what &apos;s coming from the pancreas .
and what &apos;s happening about bacteria , is that you know , every one of us in our gut is more bacteria than it is in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , think of it if antonio damasio asks you questions about the self , do you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s wet , it &apos;s very comfortable .
and you &apos;re going to all be the nutrients that you could just want to be able to do without effort .
it &apos;s really a lighter way to bacteria , with plywood , forced to get with unnecessary slaves of unintended , the gains to the outcome .
but , you know , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as they are important for their lives .
they help them multiply by essential , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will be coming in the future ?
are we in a kind of evolutionary balance in form of species ?
or are we going to be something else -- something that may be adapted to the environment ?
now let &apos;s go back to the big bang of 14 trillion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four four years ago -- the first signs of living creatures , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first one of the
in this huge unfinished symphony of the universe , life is just short , just a second , the animal kingdom , like a single flight of life , and the human life , a small baby system .
we were .
and this is also the most important of the speech , so i hope d ate it .
now , when i was a college on college , i had my first favorite job .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell in love with the power of evolution , and i realized something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in the most of the existence of life , every cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going to continue to be
but at the time , when the most important organisms look out , things began to change .
sexual reproduction is coming into the picture .
and very important , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , the genome is going to be the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the death industry of death in the same moment is going to happen in evolution in the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now i have to confess , if i was a computer scientist , i thought , okay , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reasonable to the point , but with every year , it &apos;s been my increasingly trouble .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns , which in las vegas is going to be able to show his show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat on his own book .
he opens the door .
he &apos;s a beautiful warm , a very beautiful , very warm girl .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for a ted . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization that i was a doctor who was a very different goal to be the goal of evolution -- not necessarily , just different .
i tried to keep the body .
i wanted to keep healthy .
i wanted to repair health for a disease .
i wanted to lead to a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the copying of the genome , and the next generation , adaptation and survival generation .
from an evolutionary standpoint , they are and i &apos;m developing rockets to send the genetic capacity into the next stage of orbit to drop themselves into the ocean .
i think we would all have the mood that the woody allen set to understand , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to reach immortality through my work .
i want to do it by not dying . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean to prefer the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t necessarily affect the biggest , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the brightest .
evolution is the creatures that adapt to the best to affect their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , and that &apos;s the hot steam , and that &apos;s because the hot steam is going to survive , if fish would be there , they would have a vacuum surround of it .
so , what does that mean when we look back at what happens in evolution , and how we think about the space of the people in evolution , and especially like we &apos;re looking at the next phase , i would say that there is a series of possibilities
the first is we &apos;re not going to move forward .
we have a kind of equilibrium .
and the reasons that it was the first thing that we &apos;ve done is to get a lot of dna , and we &apos;ve been able to get a lot of genes that would be otherwise more likely to be and removed from the population .
and secondly , we have a species of our environment so much as we have , that we &apos;ve done it , that they &apos;re able to adapt to us and we adapt to them .
and by the way , we go and mix and mix so much that you can &apos;t say that isolation is necessary to be necessary for evolution to be more cosmopolitan .
a second possibility is that it &apos;s going to be a kind of a traditional way of being imposed , of course , imposed by forces of nature .
and the argument , here would be that the wheels of evolution are slow down , but they &apos;re slowed down .
and so far the isolation is when we travel away from planets distant , it will be numb and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third possibility , a compelling , intriguing and terrifying opportunity .
i call it a little bit of the new development that &apos;s not just of course , but led to us as a matter of the brain , which we do .
now , how could that happen ?
how could it be that we do this ?
let &apos;s start the reality that people today are making decisions in some cultures about their offspring .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family are deciding .
so think of if it &apos;s not just possible to choose the gender of your child , but also to use genetic adaptations to heal and prevent the disease .
what if you could do the genetic changes to get diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or alzheimer &apos;s disease or to eliminate the risk of risk or stroke ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to do this change in your genes ?
if we &apos;re going to be able to be more and more of the changes , these kinds of changes are possible .
the human genome project began in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost an impossibility billion dollars .
in the next year , when it was finished , they could do the same thing for 20 million dollars in the same way to four months .
today , you can have a sequence of three billion base pairs of human tissue of human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 and in the room about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take more long until reality will be that there will be a thousand dollars of human genome , and it will be increasingly available to anyone .
a week ago , national academy of engineering gave the main prize to francis arnold and the west of the west , two scientists that were struggling to create the natural process of evolution , to work faster , to work in a more efficient way -- which is called
a few years ago , the scientists who were commissioned by the scientists was commissioned by his research in the study of a child , a computer , and through the manipulation of only four genes , the cell being induced to become a liquid stem cell -- potentially to
these changes are in the place .
the same technology that can produce the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that don &apos;t only protect themselves , but also to be able to serve the immunity against other viruses .
whether you believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in the gang with influenza , which is in the cells of a brain &apos;s cell .
can you imagine a good thing that &apos;s coming from tobacco ?
this is all reality today , and in the future , it &apos;s going to be much more possible .
so , imagine two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of their descendants ?
what if you could change the sperm and the same thing that you could change , and the same thing that you could do to give your kids a better chance to make a better chance of going -- eliminating diabetes , the risk of cancer , reducing the risk
who doesn &apos;t want to get healthier kids ?
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of science that can allow the changes to prevent disease , could also allow us to adopt the disease , to adopt the better memory .
why don &apos;t the most sophisticated of an iranian cross have a riot , especially if you can expand it with the next generation of the world &apos;s brain ?
why not have the fast search of the test that will allow you to run faster and longer ?
why not live longer ?
these are going to be the same .
and if we &apos;re on a place where we can pass it on the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want to be transformed by the evolution of evolution to the computer .
we &apos;re going to have a process that may be in the rule of 100,000 years , and we can compress it down to a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are decisions with which their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , need to be involved .
we use these decisions to form a society that is better , the more successful one ?
or will we be selectively selectively choosing different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others ?
will we form a society and we &apos;re going to be a society , or more robust and durable ?
these are the kinds of questions we need to meet .
and the deepest of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom that we need to make this decision ?
in good ways in the evil , and once you might think , these decisions are going to be on us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something that &apos;s a portable robot that gives you a little bit of skills , or another , the most powerful thing that helps you stand up and go up .
we call this robot in berkeley , and we call this robot .
they &apos;re not other than something you put in the morning and gives you additional strength and increase the speed of your pace and will help them keep their balance in , for example , to keep their balance .
this is indeed the real power of human and machine .
but not only that -- and connect with the universe and other devices out there .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers , which is about 100 pounds on its back , and it &apos;s the request that you should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major complications -- the oil , 30 percent of it -- chronic oil levels .
so we thought we would take this challenge and create a design system that would help this problem with this problem .
so let me introduce you to now -- or the human universal eeg calendar .
soldier : i can carry 200 pounds of the time of the sun &apos;s penis , many hours long .
his flexible design enables it to be deep to live in the deep way , to reproduce and highly customized movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go and raise my strength and resilience .
we &apos;re like , with our online , this device , this device , this new kind of design in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
now let &apos;s look at our view on the gateway , something i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people who have predicted the world in the wheelchair .
this is about one percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young people , and we &apos;re talking about spinal cord , &apos; 30s , &apos; 30s , &apos; 30s , &apos; &apos; 40s , hit by the fate of the fate and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about aging , the number of times that are shrinking .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it &apos;s about a design , or to other complications -- is the wheelchair .
and so it &apos;s been 500 years since that , as i say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a completely new chapter in mobility .
so let me introduce you to a second , which is carried by amanda , which was a spinal cord , who suffered 19 years ago , which has been the result that she could not run for 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our transportation system .
it has sensors .
his completely provocative sensors in crutches , the signals of the signals , which is attached to our back , which is on your back .
here are also the most powerful , the most powerful , the most powerful is on your hips , as well as your own time , moving forward in this fairly crude and very natural gait .
i was 24 years old , and in the field of prison , when a computer was a computer scientist , i was a college officer .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling and every movement underneath my own .
not long after that , a doctor in my hospital room and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go back . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s got some of the other hope of my consciousness .
and so , existential technologies have been around to learn to go back to get back , to go back and go to the hands , and even to drive with the hands .
but nothing was invented , and that was going to let me go back to now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet us and discuss them with them .
it &apos;s in our hands and we have the whole potential here to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or for amanda , but for all .
thank you .
at home in new york , i &apos;m a director of the computer company called robin hood .
if i don &apos;t get poverty , i &apos;m going to be a member of a car service in a volunteer , and i &apos;m going to call it the fire .
now , in our city , in the volunteers , a woman &apos;s volunteer worker has to be trained to be very early at the time of the world .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteer woman , so i had a good opportunity to get into it .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the savings of the people who would be able to do what our tasks would be .
when i found the most serious , he was in a very serious conversation with the computer revolution , which was certainly one of the worst days of her life .
it was in the middle of the night and she stood in the pajamas and the barefoot under a screen out in the back of the mountain , while her house was burned in flames .
the other volunteer , the only one that came from me -- we call him k to the last , and i was asked to go to the house and get asked to save the dog of the world &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was amazed .
there was some lawyer or a lawyer who was now for the rest of his life , people who could tell people that he was in a hospital house to save a living system , only because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next .
the most profound thing to me .
he said , &quot; bezos , you have to go into the house .
you have to go up to the top , where fire has gone over , and you have to get a few shoes . &quot;
i swear to it .
now , not exactly what i hoped i was hoping , but i went up -- the stairs high , the hallway , on the &quot; real &quot; of the &quot; real &quot; -- that we &apos;ve been able to get out of the bedroom with a few shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey back to the bottom , where i met my vow and the beloved dog .
we put our beliefs out to the outside of the world , where , not surprisingly , it got more attention than my own .
some weeks later , the most popular one , the most popular one , the most popular letter , where she was going to be exposed to the brave use of her house .
one of all , it &apos;s estimated that , in particular , is an extraordinary kindness : somebody had brought her a few shoes .
in my profession at robin hood and in my inbox as a volunteer , i &apos;m witness to tedsters , and i &apos;m seeing of generosity and kindness in the large scale , but i also did the most aggressive thing of the individual .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so if i look at this room , and people who have either had a success of success , or there &apos;s a way to be there , i want to be able to get this : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the lives of another to do it until you get your first million .
if you have something to give you , you &apos;ll give it .
they &apos;re in a residential factory , they put a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day will we offer a chance to save life of a human life , but every day we give us the opportunity to change one .
so they go . save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno &apos;s , mark , mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to go back from a community that knows the secret of the human genome .
a place where women have the most powerful , and sex , and the game determines the day -- where fun is a serious matter .
and no , it &apos;s not a lot of the time you &apos;re not going to be san francisco or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , her familiarity .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the forest of congo .
bonobos are with chimpanzees our next living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , which lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their favorite .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of the human evolution in the history of human evolution .
but bonobos are showing us the other side of the coin .
while chimpanzees of big , fear of a lot of people will be run , the most powerful female is led to the female females .
they really have what we &apos;ve got , because that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen to a very unlikely society in the fatal violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos are least known under the primates .
they live in the deep ocean , and they &apos;re very hard to be able to do that .
congo is a paradox -- a country extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the arena of a violent argument that has been approved for decades and almost as many lives as the first world war .
it &apos;s not surprising that these destruction also are the survival of the bonobos .
and the decline of the energy system is going to lead to the rise of the point that you could not even fill a stadium with the remaining bonobos -- and even there are not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country , of violence and chaos , you can hear a more powerful laugh , that the trees are upset .
who are these related ?
we know you as &quot; love instead of war &quot; , because they have hillel , also sex , with a little bit of sex , and rules and rules and social media and social media .
i &apos;m not saying that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because the bonobos of the bonobos are made of more than the one-eyed of the monkey .
bonobos -- like people -- love to play their lives .
play doesn &apos;t just mean the only thing .
for us and it &apos;s a game fundamentally for attachment to relationships and the care of tolerance .
we learn to learn and the rules of the game .
play is creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and if you look at bonobos in play , you see the evolutionary origins of human health , dance and rituals .
play is the most powerful thing that we &apos;re doing .
now , i don &apos;t know how they play , but i want to show you some unique images straight from the wild .
first of all , a computer company on the ground -- and i don &apos;t think football .
so here we see a young female and males in a computer scanner .
look at what she does .
this could be evolutionary origin : &quot; she throws him up with eggs . &quot;
just that i think it &apos;s more like him , not true .
yeah !
so , the point of noise is spread , both of the bonobos and people .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the most important thing that you can bring to the game that you &apos;re going to bring to the new elements -- like the testes -- and also how
but the game is a very daunting game .
play is a very important , and it can be a lot of forms of the way that some of some kind of quiet , more , more painful , is , perhaps , to discover the fake .
and i want to show you , this is a little female , a young female , and she &apos;s playing with water .
i think that &apos;s how you play sometimes , sometimes we &apos;re going to be in the verge of the rest of our inner and outer worlds .
and it &apos;s these playful curiosity that makes us work , and interact with it , and the unexpected form that we form are the real breeding stations of creativity .
this is just a little taste of the insights that bonobos give us in our past and present .
but it also true to our future , a future where we need to adapt to the demand of rising challenges , by greater creativity and more skilled cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , play is our main movement .
to be successful in a world of a world , we need to play .
but will we be doing the best from our online system ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos , and people are equally , the lives of their teeth and claws alone .
just if it &apos;s barely appropriate , play may be the most important thing .
and so , my favorite , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution , and play together , while we &apos;re changing creativity , and the wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs of mine , in 1979 , at the same day , in the same moment , every one of the baby -- okay .
so two pairs , each one of each one .
now i don &apos;t want you to use the time to imagine the telepresence , because if you imagine the whole time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
so , imagine that just for a moment .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case that &apos;s a sperm , an y , which causes the x to detect the x chromosome of the egg .
and in the other case , the sperm carries a x chromosome that causes the x chromosome of the egg .
both of these are the most stable , both climbing .
we &apos;re going to go back to these people later .
most of my activities have two suggestions .
and i &apos;m going to talk about the kind of hat that i was doing .
i was in school historian , and in this case , i study how people with anatomy -- that human body , animal bodies -- as you think of body body , with body body , as you thought about body body .
the other hat i &apos;ve been wearing at my work is the activist , as a universal -- or , as i say sometimes , as a pathogenic lawyer -- from people who are patients of doctors .
in this case , i worked with people who have the most powerful , social norms , asking the social norms .
so , for example , i worked with people who are the twins who are the twins , two people in a body .
i worked with people with a collaboration -- so people who were smaller than usual .
and very often , i worked with a lot of people who are their gender , and their gender is -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female dancing .
and as a general term , we can use the word of the word .
and it &apos;s a lot of different forms in many different forms .
i just give you a few examples of the kinds of people who don &apos;t have the male or female standard .
in a case , maybe someone has a more powerful person , and the gene &apos;s gene &apos;s gene &apos;s gene is leaving the most powerful thing we &apos;re all carrying to help grow .
and that &apos;s why the testicles are giving testosterone in the stage .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to recognize testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t react to testosterone .
and that &apos;s called the &quot; test . &quot;
so much testosterone , but no reaction to that .
and as a consequence , the body is following more of the most popular female rate .
when the kid is born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s raised as a girl .
but it takes you to get the puberty and grow your breasts and grow your breasts , but they don &apos;t get their period to get something different here .
and they make a few tests and find out that instead of being a little bit of the time , and you &apos;re in the place that you &apos;re actually carrying a lesion and you have an y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually think that person could actually hold the male , but it &apos;s not really .
women , like men , have something that is called a difference .
they &apos;re in the back of our body .
and the most important thing that &apos;s a massage is that the dna of the dna is the hormones .
most women , like i -- i think i &apos;m a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my real estate , but i think i probably have the typical -- most women like me actually talk to about a preconceived , most women like me .
we produce the food map and we &apos;re talking to a preconceived .
the consequence is that someone like me actually has a brain that was more sensitive to more than a woman who was born with testicles , and a family company has a laser .
so , gender is really complicated ; not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in a sense , you can be distributed over the whole range , you can be distributed .
one of the things that i had was a couple of years ago , i received the call of a 19 man who was born as young , who had been born with a friend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived with his girlfriend , lived in the
he had an extreme form of an innate state of nature .
he has a little chromosome chromosome , and in the womb , his favorite , his favorite , was so active that it &apos;s essentially created a male .
and as a consequence , his dried the male &apos;s male was used to the most powerful male part of the world &apos;s life .
and when he was born , he saw a boy from -- no one was allowed to do something .
and only as he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he was going to be able to get the doctors out there that the doctors were found in inner female .
okay , just a quick example of a variation of the brain .
some people with the chromosomes , some of the same things that is called the most powerful , which is called the sound of mass design .
we don &apos;t know exactly why that happens .
so , gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why kids with this kind of body -- whether it &apos;s a little bit of the body , or the twins , it &apos;s a lot of fun -- it &apos;s not a very often adapted by surgeons , not because it was , because for their physical
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason why they were often doing different ways of doing it is they &apos;re going to threaten our social categories .
typically our system is based on the idea that there is a certain set of evolutionary functions with a certain identity .
so we have the concept that a woman is being a female identity , and a black person is to be , he &apos;s supposed to be an african anatomy in terms of the own story .
so we have this awful idea .
and when we &apos;re faced with a body that actually is very different to us , that &apos;s confused us in terms of these things .
so we have a lot of romantic ideas about pregnancies .
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of microblog .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is when kids are born , the two people in a body are , in a body .
where i had been in the last time most of the excitement , south african director was last year , whose gender was asked in the world &apos;s world &apos;s world &apos;s health world in berlin .
many journalists were calling me to the question : &quot; what are you going to do , who tells us whether the most powerful is female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that there &apos;s no test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature is not a line between male and female , or female and female and female and female and female and female companies ; we &apos;re the ones that are going to be that line of
so we have a situation where , the further our science , we have to recognize more to explain that these categories that we had given for being a stable of mutual interventions , which made very simple , very simple , very small , little little little little little
and it &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
it &apos;s also true of race , which turns out to be a lot more complicated than our brain &apos;s capacity .
we &apos;ve got to all sorts of different areas in our own history .
for example , we &apos;re going to go to the fact that at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees have been together .
what should we do with the fact that we &apos;re just different from them through a few periods of periods ?
while we continue to move our science further , we get increasingly into a zone of awkwardness , where we need to recognize that the most important categories we &apos;ve probably got to be too simple .
we see that in all sorts of different areas of human life .
one of the areas that we see for the most important thing in our culture today , in our culture , are the struggle over the beginning and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about what a body is going to be , so he has a different right way of the headquarters .
we have very difficult conversations today -- maybe not as public as public -- about the question when someone is dead .
our ancestors had never been so hard to fight with the question when someone was dead .
you &apos;ve just given a feather under the nose , and if you moved , you haven &apos;t buried it yet .
if you didn &apos;t move more , you have it buried .
but today we are in a situation where we are taking people to be engaged , and they want to put them into other people .
and as a result , we &apos;re at the fight of really difficult question when someone is dead , and that brings us into a really difficult way that we don &apos;t have so simple categories as we used to .
now , you might think that all the things that are going to do is make a guy like me really happy .
i &apos;m politically hostile , i &apos;m more comfortable with people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit it &apos;s going to be a little bit nervous .
to realize that these categories are really much more insecure than we thought , i think , .
and it makes me a tense , and it &apos;s about the risk of democracy .
so to tell you about this tension , i have to first take credit , i &apos;m a big fan of the founding fathers .
i know they were a little bit of the time , i know they were a little bit of the way , but they were great .
i think that they were so reactive and they were very strong , and so radical , in which they were doing all the time of the world , i &apos;ve seen the most sophisticated of the arable tunnel in the middle of the city , and it &apos;s not
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s happened with the u.s. war .
the founding fathers were the original anatomical activists , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s the original anatomical activists .
what they were doing was a concept of a concept , and they were replacing it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
as you all remember , our founding fathers refused the concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was based on a very cleverly concept of anatomy .
the masters of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept based on dna , but they had a concept of the computer system .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power , the political power , should have been , because of the family &apos;s , the family &apos;s family , and so on .
the founding fathers of the founding , and they were going to be able to make this new kind of design model , and this concept said that all people were creating the same same thing .
they &apos;re making the field field and they decided that , in fact , that , in fact , that the common ingredient , the differences , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now they made this part because they were part of a system of a system where two things are together .
democracy grew up , but the same time grew the science .
if you look at the story of the founding fathers , it &apos;s clear that many of you were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a world &apos;s world .
they went away from explanations , and they were making things like a supernatural concept of power , back where the transmission of the world &apos;s transmission is based on a very highly sophisticated idea .
they moved to a very sophisticated concept .
and if you look at the independence of the independence , you talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature &apos;s god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , they managed to make a concept of intangible common common .
and so they have really been prepared to be prepared to be the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think about that , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened after that ?
for example , women who were looking at the right thing that the founding fathers , the concept of the founding fathers , is that there is more important than the existing difference , and said , &quot; that we have a uterus and the empirical , and we should
and women are doing that .
next was the successful civil rights movement , where we saw people like a child scientist , who was about , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the suburbs of the world &apos;s brain , which says , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people that have different skin color that mutual differences are mutually qualified to be made , again , successful .
we see the same thing at the time .
of course , the problem is that , as we start looking at all the common similarities , we need to start asking , why we are preserved certain kinds of flaws .
now , mind , i want to maintain certain pitches , and it &apos;s , in our culture , in our culture .
i don &apos;t want to give you the same rights as a human being .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should take away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that five times the day , the age of sex , to be having to be a noble or to marry .
so there are some of these of these competing cycles that make sense of me , and we think , i think , keep supposed to be .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and why we keep it , and whether you &apos;re feeling .
so let &apos;s go back to these two creatures that have been the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in 1979 , at the same day .
so imagine that one of them was born , maria , three months old , so it &apos;s born at june at june .
so , henry , on the other side , is born to the top of the day , so he &apos;s born at the one of march .
only because of the fact that maria 3 was born , they get all sorts of rights to henry -- the right thing to have to have , to have the right thing to do , which is right to drink .
henry has to wait for all this , not because he actually has another biological age , only because of the birth of his birth .
we find other oddities of what their rights is .
henry , because you think he &apos;s male -- although i don &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the mit with the sex -- because you think he &apos;s the male , he &apos;s going to be moving , and he &apos;s going to have to be moving on .
so maria can &apos;t be able to perceive the same thing in all states , the henry in all states , and that &apos;s right to marry .
henry can marry a woman , but maria can only be married in a few states today in a few states .
so we have these permanent anatomical categories that are problematic in many ways and questionable .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is doing such progress in the environment that we have to get a point where we have to admit that democracy is based on anatomy ?
i don &apos;t want to give the science , but at the same time it feels like the science is going on to be autonomous .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture is going to take a kind of pragmatic stance : &quot; well , we need to pull somewhere , so we &apos;re going to pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people caught up in a very strange position .
so for example , texas has decided to get a man to marry a man that you don &apos;t have y chromosome , and a woman means that you have an y chromosome .
now in practice , people are not tested on their chromosome .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre because of the story i told you about the most of the time .
if we look at the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream of a solution . &quot;
he says we should not be able to say , &quot; your skin skin , &quot; but after the property of your character , &quot; judge of your character , &quot; and goes beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you evaluate people because of their characters ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should be able to use the rights in humans because i have to admit that i know a series of golden golden rights people who are probably making benefits more than some people i know .
i want to know that i &apos;m probably going to know some bright plastic molecules that are the most powerful , more intelligent and more educated decisions about their sexual relationships than some people who i know .
so how should we ask the question of the character of character ?
it turns out that it &apos;s really hard .
and a part of me , what if the content was a little bit , would be done in the future -- could be visible by fmri ?
do we really want to go to this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it really matters , thinking about thinking about the idea that the united states is going to be able to make the mind of democracy .
in our endeavor , we &apos;ve done our thing really well , and i think we would do our thing in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like the case of iran , where a man who feels sexually different to other men , being punished with death , it &apos;s been ready to be prepared by a single way to be in which case he can stay alive .
states of this kind of way we don &apos;t exist .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon i talked about a few years ago , who had a few of the twins who had a few of them to separate them , partly to make a name .
but when i was doing it , and he asked him why he was doing these surgeries -- it was high surgeries -- was his answer that in his country , these kids would be very bad , and that &apos;s why he had to do it .
i said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve got political scotland to take a chance instead of having a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states provide incredible opportunities to allow people to be the ones they are , without the rest of the will .
so i think we need to be leaders .
well , just to close , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about dads .
and i want to think about the possibility of democracy , or looked at democracy , if we had more involved in the mothers .
and i want to say something that is radical , and i think that there might be different kinds of insights that are spreading from different species of anatomy , if people use a design program .
since years , since years , i was interested in the research of the research , i also interested in research in the field of research .
and one of the things i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from the research studies is that women , in average -- not every but in average -- tend to be more complex social relationships and care for people who are vulnerable to the group of people who are vulnerable to the group of attention .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation to do .
years ago , when i made a graduate school , one of my graduate students asked me to know my interest on feminism -- i looked as a feminist , so i &apos;m doing it -- a really curious question .
he said , &quot; tell me what the feminism is . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the dumbest question i &apos;ve ever heard .
feminism is about to resolve stereotypes about gender , so the feminism is nothing female .
but the more i thought about his question to think more , i could give it a female in feminism .
that &apos;s what we want to say , there might be something that is different in average , which is different women &apos;s brains of male social relationships , and so , more sensitive to the cost of the world &apos;s brain .
so where the founding fathers were extremely eager to be able to protect the state of the state , it could be possible that if we were more mothers in this concept , we &apos;re more a concept of the world , not just as you can protect , but
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go in the future , if we &apos;re going to think of democracy about anatomy -- less about individual bodies , and to think about relationships .
so , if we try to make a perfect connection , we &apos;re thinking about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a little bit of a bag and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;m going to do in it , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that is : i &apos;m obsessed with outfits .
i love to find another opportunity to find a different kind of crazy outfit , to wear , and to photograph , and to photograph , and to photograph it .
but i don &apos;t buy new .
i get all my clothes from the second hand on the top of the hand and in the field of glass .
ooh , thank you .
and i &apos;m going to try to reduce the impact of my favorite , and also to reduce the impact of my oncologist .
i meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars is usually serving a good purpose ; i see pretty unique ; and it &apos;s going to go shopping to my very personal personal experience .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
will it have my height ?
will i like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and i tell you what i was doing for this exciting week at ted .
i mean , what does someone bring with a lot of outfits ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven of the children &apos;s homes , and that &apos;s all .
and the same one week , all i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i have a ph.d. i &apos;d like to do everything i might wear , if i just came to palm springs .
and since they &apos;re not hearing me from my wife , who walk around here at ted in their underwear -- means that i found a few things .
and i just want to show you my outfits for this week .
sounds good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m going to leave you some of the lessons i think you &apos;re thinking or not , from these beliefs , not to wear new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call that the luminous tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can look at almost less and less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket , has been fed me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i &apos;ve been wearing this entire week .
monday : color is a little powerful .
it &apos;s almost physiological , bad to be bad , if you wear a pants pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you &apos;re going to take other happy people .
tuesday : adaptation is totally disconnected .
i spent a lot of time talking about my life trying to be , and i &apos;m going to adapt to myself .
just be , who you are .
if you &apos;re surrounded by the right people , you &apos;re not going to be able to understand it , you &apos;ll also value it .
wednesday : hug your inner child .
sometimes people say i &apos;d be out of dress , and i &apos;ll be on her , or i remember her .
i would like to say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
thursday : confidence is the key .
if you think it &apos;s good from something , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think that you &apos;re not very good in something , you probably have right .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only as i became 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to summarize that for you .
if you believe that you &apos;re in the outside and the outside of a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to rock everything we want .
thank you .
friday : a universal truth -- five words : golden design can fit to everything .
and finally , saturday : a single unique , personal style , is a great way of telling the world about one , without saying a word .
it was always proven to me and over and over when people got to me , just because of what i was wearing , and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home , i &apos;ll give it all the time .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn about this week is that it &apos;s okay to let .
i don &apos;t have to get emotionally charged , because the same thing is going to be a different crazy , more energetic , and i &apos;ll give you a different crazy piece of outfit that just wait for me when i love a little bit in the heart and
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , all together .
i &apos;ve got something that i want to show you .
think of this as a flying ball as flying as flying .
this is what we call the lab , we call design design .
let me tell you a little bit about it .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m originally italian , and every young boy in italy is growing with this image in his room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is something very interesting in the mind in the last decades .
a few times ago , it was that if you wanted to win a formula , then you took your budget and put money on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , then they won the race .
now , you need to take a race , if you want to win a race , actually something like this -- something that &apos;s going to be a car in real time , some thousand sensors that are going to get information from the car , and then they
this would call you , in the blink of a game , a computer test .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that is made from two parts -- a very small part and a more of a design .
what &apos;s interesting today is the most important thing that &apos;s interesting in our lives .
our cities were equipped in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
they become the computer in the free .
and as a computer in free , you start to respond to other kinds and way , you &apos;re being seen and driven .
if we &apos;re going to feed cities , that &apos;s a big thing .
and by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the earth &apos;s surface , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population is living there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the u.s. emissions -- to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
over the cities , all of this sense , and it &apos;s going to drive into objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition , paola antonelli , after moma , in the year , while the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; me . &quot;
now , all our objects , our environment , are starting to talk to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like any atom out there will be at both , a sensor and a kind of a laser .
and that changes radically the interaction that we have in our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , as a michelangelo shaped the moses , it means he took the hammer on moses and he was actually going to see him on moses -- you still can see a little bit of a place -- and said , &quot; aw , &quot; would you like
now , today , our environment begins to answer us to answers .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with the realization .
now the first project i want to introduce you to is in fact of one of the first of our lab .
it was developed in italy four years ago .
and what we &apos;ve done was actually a new way of using a network of network that was used on the world -- that &apos;s a kind of a -- and anonymous and the other information of this network , which are collected in the way that the city works
the summer was a happy summer -- 2006 .
it was as a italy that was won the most of the time .
some of you will remember it was like italy , in italy , and then the end of the day , the most powerful thing .
and anyway , in italy , in italy , it won &apos;t have the end .
now , you see what happened in this day , just watching activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see the middle of the middle , the flow of the flow .
on the morning , the game .
you see the timeline up .
and the afternoon , people here and there , they &apos;re making the phone phone and they move .
the game starts -- silent .
france makes a gateway . italy makes a gateway .
and it &apos;s covered by people a short call , go on toilet .
second , it &apos;s cut down . end of the normal .
first of all , second agency .
so , in a moment of the computer bank , the ted test .
in italy , yeah . yeah .
now , in this night , all of the center went to celebrate .
they saw the big significance .
the next day , all of the center went to the center and the prime minister to meet the same time .
and then all of them went down .
you see the picture of the space , the biggest script , where , since the roman time , people go to celebrate -- to have a big party , and you see the significance on the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city today , on a way of how we couldn &apos;t do it a few years ago .
another example of a sense of feeling : this is not about people , but to make things that we use and consume .
now , today we know everything about where our things come .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that have a mac computer , like you came together .
but we only know about where the things go .
so we actually designed a few little markers in this project to track the waste in the trash of the system .
so we started with some volunteers that we have , a little more than a year , in seattle , which things that they &apos;re doing -- different kinds of things that they can see -- things that they would throw away with .
then we have the little chips that are pulling up little brands , on the trash , and started to track it .
here are the results that we &apos;ve just got .
from seattle ...
after a week .
and that information was found that there &apos;s a lot of dna in the system .
we can do the same things in fact with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of the more sophisticated , more complicated things .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day , that the cup we throw away is not just that you &apos;re still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle that we still throw away every day .
and if we show the people , then we can move a change change .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague on the mit , the most powerful , could tell you a lot more about the sense and the many other wonderful things that you can do with insight , tell , but i want to talk to you about the second part , which we &apos;ve been
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in the u.k.
it started with a question of the foreign center , which came to us and said that spain and the most powerful tradition have a beautiful tradition of water as part of architecture .
and the question was : how could you do technology , new technology with it ?
and one of the ideas that were measured at a very somber rate was , imagine that tubes , and valves , the labor , they &apos;re going to open up and close .
they cause what a nuclear test is like a plastic bottle of water .
if these are the fall of rock fall , you can write patterns , you can write patterns , images , text .
and you can get to him , and he &apos;s going to open up to make it open , like you can see on this picture .
well , we introduced the mayor to the studio .
it &apos;s very dear to him .
and we got the assignment to design the expo in the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was from water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you approach it , it will open up and you &apos;ll let it go .
the roof was covered with water also .
and if it &apos;s windy , if you want to reduce the syringes , you can even leave the roof down .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture is going to be , like in this case , you know , that days , if you &apos;re going to get the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve
no , they didn &apos;t break the building , it &apos;s just that architecture disappears .
here you see the building working .
you see the person who asks what happens inside .
and here you see me when i tried to test these sensors that opened the water , not getting wet .
now , i should tell you what happened to you when all the sensors stopped to work .
but actually , it was a greater fun thing .
all the children from the building came to the building , because the way they were playing with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to give you a little bit , but a building that still had breaks and holes in the water , you had to jump down to the water .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people are using things that we design .
but the reality is constantly unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beauty of creating things that are used and interact with people .
now here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical , the physical , the core of water and the projections .
and this is what we got to think about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine that these are really the same possible things that could be really beginning to fly .
imagine you could have little helicopter , which flies through the air , and each of them with a little bit of light with a little bit of light with light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like that you saw earlier , that moves with other people , completely in sync with each other .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or irregular but in three dimensions that that changes , the light is not the position of the brain .
you can play with different kinds of species .
imagine if you could just look at the screen in different ways or sizes , in different ways .
but then the whole thing could be a 3d cloud of the plastic , which you can do and move through it , which you can see from many , many directions .
here you see a real estate model that &apos;s going to be a very big sixth star , like a second sixth star .
if you turn the light off , it looks like this . so , as we saw earlier .
imagine that every single person is being run .
it could have any impulse to a impulse that comes from people , from the movements of people or anything .
i want to show you something here first .
we &apos;ve worked with the most powerful , and we have a great ballet , the best ballet ballet -- the metropolitan theater in new york , in new york and the scale in milan -- we &apos;ve taken its movements in 3d to use it as a momentum for
here you &apos;re dancing in the phone .
on the left , you see the most sophisticated , different sensations .
it &apos;s a very important one , and it &apos;s a very talkative .
so that you can feel the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we have all the time , you can play with it and play with color movement and play with color .
we want to use that as a possible impulse for the design system .
i want to show you the latest project we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we work on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
so , the idea is , imagine that we &apos;re going to engage the people with something to do and change the environment -- almost something like we call it , the design of a cloud , but with a cloud .
imagine that every one of them can give a little donation for a football system .
i think that the remarkable thing that &apos;s the last few years is that we &apos;re going to change a physical world to a digital world .
this has been all the way , knowledge , and it &apos;s accessible by the internet .
today , we can take the first time -- and the campaign of obama has shown this -- we can move from the digital world , from the world &apos;s forces to change the physical world .
that can be , in our case , that we use it to design and create a symbol .
that &apos;s what &apos;s built in the city .
but tomorrow , it can be to ask us to get the next challenges -- think about climate change , or co2 emissions -- as we can then shift from digital world to physical .
so the idea is that we actually engage people with them , and they do , to do collective .
the cloud is again a cloud of plastic , in the same way , like a real cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , as our cloud is a cloud of plastic .
it &apos;s a physical physical form in london , but it &apos;s covered with a plastic .
you can move and make different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , which is the most important moments for the most important 2012 and beyond , and it uses a kind of connection to the community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something that you can go to the top of the sun , like london &apos;s new mountain .
you can get there .
and a kind of digital fiddler in the night -- but as a master , a new way of experiencing all the way to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , i &apos;m very important to the relationship .
i &apos;m trying to express that people are not separate from nature and that everything is connected .
the first time i was in antarctica almost 10 years ago , where i saw my first bow .
i did awe .
my heart sank , i was a little bit of the time , as i tried to grab what was going on .
the thylacine around me almost 60 meters from the water , and i could only wonder that this was a snowflake on a different snowflake , year year .
epidemiologists are born as a calf , or by breaking out of the rubber .
every iceberg has its own individual personality .
they &apos;re interacting with the very precise way of their environment and their experiences .
some people are complaining to give up and the rebel to the bitter end , as others don &apos;t get to touch and put it in a fit of more dramatic passion .
if you look at an iceberg , you think that you &apos;re isolated , separated and alone , and you &apos;re very much like we can see people often .
but the truth is far away from it .
while a iceberg melts , i &apos;m going to cut his carbon atmosphere .
while the iceberg melts , he &apos;s going to cut up drinking drinking water , which feeds a lot of life forms .
i &apos;m going to my footage that i &apos;m going to do as if i was doing portraits of my ancestors , in which consciousness , that they exist in these individual moments , and never will exist again .
it &apos;s not death when you melt ; it &apos;s not a end , but a more of your life cycle along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the field of ice i &apos;m going to be very young -- some thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is a iceberg that i &apos;ve been in in greenland in greenland .
very rarely , you &apos;re actually going to witness a giant iceberg .
here you see it .
on the left , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg and where he is on the top of the iceberg .
you can see here , he starts to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a solar project .
it &apos;s about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is real time .
and just like this , the iceberg shows a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really incredibly blessed by work to some amazing projects .
but at the coolest , what i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy .
his name is a little bit of a laser .
and the chief was one of the leading graffiti of the 1980s .
then , one day , he came back from walking back and said , &quot; dad , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of the as .
now , it &apos;s completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i was standing on him .
so i have a company that makes design and animations , so i was desperate to make a complex part of what we admire in the art world and watch attention .
so we decided , tony -- and to support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and he said , &quot; we &apos;ll give you this money .
what are you going to do with that ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
i just want to leave with him again , and i said , &quot; wait , i &apos;ve seen this -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t be all the paralyzed people with this devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you heard about the higher consumer , and a remarkable insurance can do it , you can do that .
normal people are not accessible to these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
does anybody see the movie , and the movie of the butterfly ?
so they communicate -- they &apos;re walking along the way .
i was amazed : &quot; very , very , very , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came to the need to just give a check , just put a check out of the , which i didn &apos;t have the smallest idea of how i was supposed to make him .
i &apos;m preparing to get the place , and i &apos;m going to be in the process of his brother and his father -- &quot; well , my proposal is like this : tony will speak , we &apos;ll get a device , and we &apos;ll find a way that
because it &apos;s a farce that someone who &apos;s still wearing it , it cannot communicate . &quot;
so i talked a couple months later at a conference .
i met these people from the computer lab , graffiti research lab and they have a technology that allows them to set up a light on each surface and then draw with a plastic camera that only was the negative surface .
so they &apos;re moving around and they make the design of these .
they say that all things that are shown up there is a life cycle .
it starts with the genital organs , then the most important , the most important , and finally , the people are doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in their presentation .
so i went home , and i was eating with my wife and told her about everything and we thought , &quot; well , second time , when there are these technologies , you can get the way that you can use your eyes to control things , and then
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and lots and lots and lots of things , we &apos;ve achieved some things .
first , we have the insurance companies , and we have the doors , and actually , for a machine , they get a device that can communicate -- a stephen scholar .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him a little bit of the time , because you talk to him , or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so reactive , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and we also have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all the other corners of the world -- to us .
my wife , my children and i went into the garage , and these hackers and the programmers and the programmers and the computer and the computer and the computer .
many of our friends thought we &apos;re beautiful to do that and that we were going to be the main and all the images on the walls , and they were the content of the walls .
but for about two weeks , we &apos;ve been designing , we went to the prison center in venice , my kids were involved , my dog , and we created this .
it &apos;s called the &quot; and you can see the description . &quot;
this is a cheap cybercrime that we bought at the top of the venice of venice , something more nuanced and a few things from the sales store and the water store .
we took a design , you have a set of people , and you have a set of light , and now we have a device that &apos;s free -- you can build it yourself , we can make the code free , you can download the code free .
so we have created a device that is completely free from limitations .
no insurance can be .
no hospital .
now , every paralyzed can actually communicate with your eyes , or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back into the village .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room of somebody else and that &apos;s his room .
there &apos;s all these kind of big unveiling that we have .
and after about a year of planning , two weeks of life , the first time , and the previous nights , tony and vice nights , tony was going to be a first time after seven years .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he looks beyond his life life system .
we &apos;re down to his bed so he can see it outside .
we put a projection on a wall of the hospital , the hospital &apos;s center .
and he did again to the first time , in his family , and you can just imagine what was a sense of a lot of the parking .
so , we &apos;ve had a lot of time to break in the parking rooms , so we felt like a part of the world &apos;s brain .
at the end , he sent us an email with the idea of the content : &quot; for the first time i &apos;ve been doing something , i &apos;ve been doing something .
i feel that i was going to lay down underwater and finally , someone got up and raised my head , so i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that mind-blowing ?
this is something like our favorite system .
and that &apos;s what we keep going on in the shelf and we &apos;ll continue to develop .
and we have to better better than that .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a very amazing thing .
and someone who has such an artistic potential , so much more .
so we &apos;re in terms of figuring out how to make it better and stronger .
since that time , we &apos;ve all received the kinds of recognition .
we won a few awards .
remember , it &apos;s free , none of us deserves .
it comes from our own pockets .
so the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong &apos;s lessons on us and then , in december , we honored the most of the world &apos;s innovation as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 .
the most important thing about this -- and this is what it &apos;s about all the circle -- that this is this april , that this april , in the middle of the city , will give an exhibition in the middle of los angeles .
and there &apos;s probably the hardest representatives of the world &apos;s most difficult , and the most difficult of the most powerful , most powerful , the most powerful , the most powerful -- all these guys will be there .
and it &apos;s going to be part of the show , which is pretty wild .
so basically , i &apos;m about : if you see something that &apos;s impossible , it can make it possible .
everything in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the most powerful -- it was impossible to do it .
do it -- you all have this .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never done anything with a little bit of a problem , but i just have been blown up and i &apos;ve been surrounded by amazing people so we could put together something on the legs .
and this question should be everybody , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing , and that &apos;s what you do , that you have to make something that has to be done , and if not now , when not , and if i don &apos;t , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for kids , and i &apos;m probably most of america &apos;s most popular .
and i &apos;m always saying that i don &apos;t want to get a scientist like this .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody has ever chosen farmers .
today , i want to tell you about circles and formulas .
well , a epiphany is usually something that you find because you &apos;ve left it somewhere .
you go to the block and it &apos;s considered a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard , martin , .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you about today .
my circle started at the &apos; 60s at the &apos; 60s at high school in the &apos; 60s , ohio , where i was the most marked .
i was the one that was beaten every week in the south bronx , and the blue was saved until a teacher saved my life .
they saved my life by using me the toilet in the middle of the house .
they were doing that .
she did it for three years .
and i had to get away from the city .
i had an thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it struck me to san francisco in california -- i found a lover -- and then in the &apos; 80s , i found it a job in the &apos; 80s .
about three or four years ago , i received a call in the middle of the night , and ms. post , who said , &quot; i have to see it .
i &apos;m sad that we &apos;ve never known each other as adults .
you can please come to ohio , and please come together with the man that i know you &apos;ve found it now .
and i should say that i have a lot of time , and i want you to go to that , please . &quot;
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we laughed , we cried , and we knew they &apos;d be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we brought them to , and we took them , and we gave them eight , because it needed to be necessary , because it was necessary .
it was something that we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as adults , i was struck by it , and she turned into a box of it , and was put in my hands .
what happened was that the circle had closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation of that i &apos;ve talked about was that i &apos;ve talked about .
the revelation is a part of the life of life .
she saved my life , and my partner and i saved her .
and you know , this part of life needs everything that needs the rest of life .
he needs truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this was so often mentioned .
he needs the same -- he would need , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s to give us these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , while they climb up on 1,000 feet .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine a wall , suggesting that , encouragement , encouragement , encouragement , encouragement , encouragement .
it sounds awful .
well , i had a unique place on this day ; i was sitting on a book of mine .
i was the only one who could speak with the air industry .
so i saw it right , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had been turned out and we were not so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot took the machine after the hudson river .
this is not usually the route .
it turns out the engines .
imagine a little bit of a plane .
and then he said three words -- the most sophisticated words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; the ground to the ground &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the ted system .
i could see it in her eyes , because it was horror , life was at the end .
i want to share with you three things that i &apos;ve learned about this day .
i learned that in a moment everything is different .
we have this kind of film , we have these things that we want to do in life and i thought to all the people i wanted to make a hand and not , all the fences i wanted to make , and didn &apos;t do all the fences i
while i was thinking about it later , a saying that , &quot; i collect bad wine . &quot;
because when the wine is , and the person is there , i open him .
i never want to move a little bit more in life .
and this urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned from this day -- and that was when we were going to bridge the george washington bridge , so pretty much about starbucks -- i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing i really really do .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i , i , i get better to become better in everything i &apos;m going to do .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve been given my ego to room .
and i was the time that i &apos;m wasted for the time of the things that i &apos;m wasted for for the people who mean something .
and i thought to the relationship with my wife , to people , to people .
and after i thought about it , i decided to ban negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t tell you two years of my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have a right right ; i &apos;ve made myself happy .
the third thing i learned -- and that &apos;s the inside of the clock , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot;
you see the water coming .
i said , &quot; check on the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 parts , as you know it from documentary .
while we were rolling out , i had this feeling , man , to die , not terrifying .
almost as if we prepare our lives for the long time .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and this sadness &apos;s brain cycle really in a thought , which is that i just just one thing .
i just wish i could see my kids growing up .
about a month after , i went to a performance of my daughter -- and i didn &apos;t know a lot of artistic talent ...
... not .
and i &apos;m going to see , i &apos;m like a little kid .
and in the world , everything was made of a sense of me .
i realized that i was in the face of the dots with each other , that it &apos;s just a great father to be a great father .
more than anything , everything else is my only goal in life , a good father .
i was able to get the miracle in this day , not to die .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , and to live and live and live .
my call to all of you who fly today is : imagine , do you know what &apos;s happening on your flight -- don &apos;t -- but imagine it , and how would you change ?
what would you do , that you put , because you think they &apos;re forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy inside ?
and more than anything else , are you the best parents you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the mill is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for the development of nuclear weapons is the most powerful thing in the world .
the gray boxes that you see here is the most powerful .
now , if we &apos;re going to work on the systems that control the systems and valves , then we can actually do a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes are not running with the same thing ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do it that a effective energy model on a laptop is used by a metal company to get this gray box , then we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind angeline .
so we start with a laser camera .
the most popular box will go to the gray box , the centrifuge , and the iranian , in the northern hemisphere , is to go -- mission accomplished .
this is a piece of cake , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started to shave our research six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was the sense and purpose of this kind of thing .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the most complicated part of the world &apos;s brain , which is the most powerful part of the food , made of a lot of them .
and it seemed something more interesting , with these gray boxes , these miniature boxes .
the shared of our attention and we started a team project in which we were infected with our environment with angeline , and we studied this construction .
and then something weird happened .
so , it was like a design of a car that &apos;s not like our cheese -- it &apos;s a little bit like , but didn &apos;t eat him .
that &apos;s not what i did in my eyes .
and after we were experimenting with different kinds of cheese , i went to realize that this is a population attack .
completely on a particular destination .
the key line goes into the gray box , when a special configuration was discovered , even if it &apos;s a special program , even if that &apos;s a particular program that tries to get out of this goal .
and if not , it doesn &apos;t matter anything .
so , the principal really , really , my interest and we started working with the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , a u.s. economy , or a u.s. economy , will be in germany .
so we should be better out to find what the goal is .
so , we &apos;re going to go and see the code of the code , and we found that it &apos;s in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a larger one .
and we also noticed that they were very professional , and they were very professional , which had all of the other information that they have to do .
they knew all bits and they had to attack them .
you probably knew the most important thing about the most powerful thing .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve been surprised , the most sophisticated of angeline is complex and high-tech , let me tell you : the most powerful is a science for itself .
it &apos;s much more difficult than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this kind of screen code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines code .
looks like interactive , like interactive tv .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart from this code .
so after the first thing we looked at , the most powerful , we were looking at the most powerful , because we know what this is doing .
and then we went to search and we were trying to get these with the real world in connection -- with potential aim in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could demonstrate or prove .
so , to make these theories , we call ourselves in memory that it &apos;s definitely about the kind of energy , it has to act about a high goal , and it &apos;s probably in iran because most infections were reported there .
now , in this area , there &apos;s not several thousand goals .
it &apos;s basically going out to the water power system and on the top of the brain in the field .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; i &apos;m going to take a list of all experts for centrifuge and power plants from our client . &quot;
and i called them and they know their knowledge to compare their expertise to what we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital technology to the computer &apos;s head of connection .
the rotor is this moving part inside the centrifuge , these black objects that you see .
and if you manipulated the speed of this mountain , you actually have to crack the light to get rid of the rotor and actually , you know , the centrifuge explode .
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack was actually , and to make it happen , and it &apos;s very clear -- obviously , to try to get a lot of sudden that we would be able to get back to the point of thinking about
the great digital media revolution -- we got a glimpse by looking at the data and looked at the data .
so for example , the number of dna is very out of this code , and you can &apos;t miss it .
i started to do scientific literature , like this portable in the field of glass , and found that they &apos;re a mess in so-called the so-called , and they &apos;re also in so-called the so-called , and they &apos;re also dominating the carbon dioxide .
so that made sense , it tasted together .
and it &apos;s better .
these portable people in iran are divided in 15 times the base .
and guess what we found in the business system ?
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
so again , that &apos;s really true together .
and this gave us great confidence for that , which we studied here .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong , that wasn &apos;t easy .
these results were achieved by several weeks .
and we often ran into a dead and had to collect us .
anyway , we found that both digital warheads in reality , in fact , is on one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little computer processing takes a more powerful , and it &apos;s going to slow the spam and down the hand and the big , very large , and the big estate system is going to be in interaction with six to a six of them in interaction and manipulated
so , in the big and all we &apos;re very confident that we actually have , what the goal is .
it &apos;s a little bit of the street , and it &apos;s just a little bit of water .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other targets could be made of angeline .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- i &apos;ve got really out of the socks .
there &apos;s the gray box down there , and the top is the pro-social .
now , what makes this thing happen is that it &apos;s the forces of sensors that are suspended by sensors -- for example , of the design and the design of the -- and it &apos;s available to the code , which is still available to the attack , with
and in fact , this false powers of acrylic data is made before it was .
so it &apos;s like in the car car , where the car car is fed up with the car phone with previously the car phone .
that &apos;s cool , right ?
the idea of this is obviously not just the most playful in the control of the control .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more more than more dangerous .
the idea is to sound a digital model .
we need digital media technology where a human being can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a power station for example , if the big bang is becoming too fast , you have to open up to the point of information .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human race .
so , this is what we need to do digital design systems .
and if the risk of the population is , you can really have bad things .
the power station can explode .
and neither the most important , the most important thing is that it will notice .
that &apos;s scary .
but it &apos;s even worse .
and what i &apos;m saying now is very important .
think about it . this attack is a lot of time .
it &apos;s not done with a pro-social , with cement , with a fiber .
so , for example , he would work exactly as well -- in a power station or a traffic station .
it &apos;s a plastic game .
and you don &apos;t have to -- when the attacker -- you have to have the most of the time that you have to put it on a surface of a stick , like we &apos;ve seen in angeline .
you could also use ordinary technology technology to spread .
you have to spread it as far as possible .
and if you do that , you get a nuclear weapon of mass weapon .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to ask .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of goals is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all of these green areas , these are the most sophisticated environments .
we need to ask the consequences and we &apos;re going to start to prepare ourselves .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it was reported a lot of it , that people assume that the most important thing is the most powerful thing behind .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
i think the main force is the most involved thing , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the most powerful superpower .
there &apos;s only one and this is the united states -- luckily , fortunately .
because otherwise our problem would be even bigger .
thank you for letting us a tragedy . thank god .
i spent the last few years to put myself in situations that usually are very difficult and somehow dangerous .
i went to jail -- hard .
i worked in a business shop -- dangerous .
i filmed in a hospital -- hard and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days , nothing like this , to eat -- fun at the beginning , a little bit of hard in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
i actually have the biggest part of my career that seems to be the terrible part of the career , and that all just for trying to study social history in terms of the study that they &apos;re compelling and interesting , and hopefully to understand what they &apos;re doing
so when i knew that i would come here to look at the world of the world &apos;s world , and i knew i knew i would do something a little bit different .
some of you may have heard that i took a display on ebay a few weeks ago .
i sent a few of the people who have a few of the people who have been able to get the opportunity to get the most powerful thing on my tedtalk 2011 .
really , some happy people and companies , and the business , and the most comfortable , the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris anderson will never let it get to the end of the day -- the most powerful thing that you &apos;re seeing at the time
so what you got was this : your name here is explaining : my tedtalk , from which you have no idea what the theme is going to be , and the first thing that you could do is to fly the ears , especially , if i started to
but it &apos;s a very good media opportunity , but it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a whole lot .
this is just the most popular thing .
so despite that warning , i knew that someone would buy the most of the time .
now , if you asked me this one year , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you about sure .
but in the new project i work on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the advertising .
i &apos;ve been able to go out in some pretty terrible situations , and i couldn &apos;t get to prepare , nothing could be kept to me , and i could not get to go to anything so hard to go and go and be so dangerous as these guys
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is a film about the most sophisticated , marketing , advertising , and advertising , where the whole movie is funded by the whole film , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; world &apos;s &quot; is called &quot; the &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the &quot; world &apos;s &quot; is going to be that everything , from top to the bottom , from the beginning to the end , is totally tagged with brands -- from the bottom of the world , which you &apos;re going to see in
now this brand , the most powerful stadium , the most salient center ...
these people are going to be connected to the movie in eternity -- forever .
and so the movie is going to look at this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a person &apos;s dream .
that was more to note .
it was &quot; in eternity , forever . &quot;
but we &apos;re not just going to have the brand x as a result of the day , but we &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;re going to sell any possible category in the movie .
so we might sell a shoe and he &apos;s going to sell the greatest shoe that you ever had ...
the greatest car you ever have , from &quot; the &quot; the &quot; world &apos;s &quot; is the greatest drink that you &apos;ve ever had , a attention from &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; world &apos;s &quot; -- the most powerful of the sun &apos;s brain .
so the idea is , besides showing that brands are part of life , they actually get to fund the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of all the film is transparency .
you &apos;ll see the whole thing in the movie of stomatopods .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to end .
and i would be happy if i would help , if you could help , that &apos;s what i would like to do .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i first heard it , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how to be a lot of the people .
have you a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; vantage point &quot; because that &apos;s got an negative , but you know how that will evolve ?
how much money will it require to realize ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s going to be hard to meet , but i think it &apos;s worth all that it &apos;s worth a really , some really well-known brands .
and if the movie comes out , we might see how a whole bunch of a bunch of a bunch of a tribe .
what do you think the answer is ?
the answer is probably not going to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing about the movie or a difficult thing to me ?
jk : both .
so ... so , not so optimistic .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about what brands .
yes .
if you look at people who you have to do it ...
there are some places that we can turn to .
so , imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; imagine the camera &quot; mean , we wanted to have a design system .
it turns out it meant , &quot; we want to do nothing with your film . &quot;
and just so , all these companies disappeared , one after the other .
not to do something with the movie .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with the project .
and i was confused because i thought the whole concept of advertising is the idea of advertising , and to present the product as many people as possible as possible .
especially in the world today , at this interface of new and ancient media and the fragmented media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea in this new exciting microwave background that the mass that gets this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea had a kind of error , and that was this .
actually , it wasn &apos;t the mistake at all .
that would have been no problem at all .
that would have been okay .
but what this picture is is a problem .
look , if you &apos;re in math in the field of field , this is one of the first images that seems to be .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and engineering , just to discover and adapt to the very extreme ; naturally , characterized by basic ideas and access to information , especially what &apos;s the last thing -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re now listening to a lot of transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but if it comes to , it &apos;s going to be done , changing something .
but why ? well , transparency is a convenient -- like this strange bear , which still pulls out .
it &apos;s a little bit of a laser -- like this strange highway .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what else is that risky ?
a whole dish cool food .
that &apos;s very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
see , when i was a kid and my father was caught me in lying -- and he &apos;s sitting and looks at me with this view -- would say , &quot; my son , it &apos;s three versions of it .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
but there &apos;s only one company , a agency , and that &apos;s just to help us -- and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve been watching john bond and richard gehry &apos;s for years -- i realized i had to do it alone , i had to go to the
so what you suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that when you start talking to these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , a broad problem .
i have friends who make big , huge , giant , giant , big , little bits of music , and i have friends that are making small pieces of glass like i do .
and my friends , the great , huge , giant , giant , big , say that the reason your films are so successful , is the most important thing that they have .
and then my friends , who make little bits of music , &quot; well , how should we compete with these big , gigantic , giant ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the box of the sun &apos;s brain . &quot;
so how exactly will we actually get to the movie in the movie ?
whenever i make myself go on the way , and whenever i open the metal , you &apos;ll see the most of the time that you &apos;re going to see the internet .
and every time i do somebody , i can say , &quot; are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you ready ? you see a little nervous .
i want to help you calm up .
so maybe you should have a little bit of this interview . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great things to happen .
either &quot; aw fusion &quot; or a &quot; paradise &quot; is a &quot; paradise &quot; , you &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re being equipped with men as well as women -- find , &quot; well , &quot; or a stick , whatever .
this is the most popular thing .
now i can answer all of your questions and give you a more powerful version of the frames .
we &apos;re a smaller token .
so as you talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand of a design .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like others .
so , to make things like this -- you know , people on the shipping of the people -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested in .
what words would you describe to the words ?
let &apos;s ban it .
this is a great question .
so , technology technology .
technology is not the way you should describe something that someone is doing under the upgrade .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think , &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that these category really makes a little more positive , unlike &quot; fight smell and moisture . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we keep them more fresh -- better fresh , more fresh , three times more fresh .
these things have a more positive effect .
and that &apos;s a video system .
what about me ? what about the internet ?
i have to talk to the man on the street , which are like me , the way i &apos;m going to go .
you should tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
hmmm , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like nice clothes .
&apos; 80s , he &apos;s on a tour of the street , except at the time .
well , what is the brand &apos;s brand ?
unique .
i think the most important thing that i have , the style i have , is &quot; the glamour glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , many of the most powerful and a lot of the things .
but normally i have a design of the way that lucas , or a jewelry , or a jewelry , and so on .
if dan was a brand , he would probably be a classic temporary car .
the brand i &apos;m , the brand i &apos;m , is going to say , &quot; i &apos;m going to say , &quot; fly fly . &quot;
and a part of the first hippie , part of the doodle , part of the world &apos;s sake -- i don &apos;t know .
man 3 : i &apos;m the most salient thing .
i &apos;m selling up in the entire country , the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , ambitious industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex , because i was a little bit of sleeping .
dude 5 : brand brand brand &apos;s worth of happiness .
is this ?
lawyer : i &apos;m a computer scientist .
i &apos;m tom .
well , we can &apos;t be all the most sophisticated , but i often see myself on the interface of the computer interface , and we see the fly of the glamour .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed an expert .
i needed somebody who could go inside my head , someone who could really help me understand what you call &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the &quot; the
and so i found a company called db , in the lab .
they have companies like a design of water , and they &apos;re going to be able to discover the same thing that we &apos;re doing .
if you could do it for the do , they could also help me .
they brought their pictures , right ?
i have this . the first picture is a picture of my family .
just tell me a little bit about how that &apos;s related to your thoughts and feelings about her .
these are the people who make my worldview .
tell me about this world .
so , the world ? i think the world is the world that you live in -- how people around a world , the family , the family , the way you live , the way you live , the work and so .
all these things come and start from a place , and i start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s next is that you want to talk about that .
the next one . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is that to the idea and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are strangely friendly . i like weird things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; is the &quot; why do you bring us ? &quot;
what &apos;s the most important thing ? what &apos;s the most important thing ?
why is it important to be more important ? what does the red represents ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little more about them , that they &apos;re not .
what else do you have through the ground ?
... that doesn &apos;t have to be a fear . what kind of rollercoaster are you ?
so , no , thank you . thank you .
thank you very much for your patience .
yeah . well .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to be .
there &apos;s a lot of crazy things that went out there .
the first thing i saw was this idea that her favorite , two separate , but it &apos;s got a little bit of the other sides -- the morgan , is a very , a brand brand .
so , they &apos;re very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with that .
and i think some companies are just going to focus on a strength instead of both .
many companies tend to -- and this is the human nature -- to avoid that they &apos;re not sure they &apos;re afraid of being afraid , and that they &apos;re going to be welcome to the , and they &apos;re actually going to turn them into something positive , and
what other brands do that like ?
the first is a classic , apple .
and you can see it here , target , wii , little little metal of mini metal and metal .
now , there &apos;s a lot of behavioral brands and behavioral brands , these things that come and go , but a more powerful brand is a pretty strong thing .
a more nuanced brand , a brand brand , how is your brand brand ?
if you ask , to describe your favorite , your favorite , your favorite , how would you ?
you &apos;re a little bit of a laser ? are you doing something that &apos;s going to bring blood into the car ?
or are they more likely to be a more powerful ?
are you something that a little bit quiet , more selfish , is it more conservative ?
so , the things that are the playful ones , things are the playful , fresh as the most powerful , delicate , fuzzy , failed and inadequate , and more nuanced , and agile , and agile , and profane , and profane , and profane , and cooling
or are they more like a design of a design ?
are you mindful and more vulnerable to how you &apos;re viewing ?
are they established , traditionally , more powerful , more unpredictable , compassionate , how oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , more powerful , safe , flop , stops , and how the dalai lama or the apple &apos;s &quot; ? &quot;
in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies , the high ones , and the &quot; no &quot; said , &quot; no , because they wanted to be part of the project .
they wanted nothing to do with this film , because they didn &apos;t have control , no control about the finished product .
but it &apos;s going to be 17 to the people who were willing to get up to these control , which were to make people feel like that , and then they were making us , and then they were going to tell us stories that we would not have
they &apos;re going to tell us the story of the world &apos;s history , as we tell the story in this film , that you &apos;re using a little bit of the time that you &apos;re using the brain &apos;s brain to make both advertising , both advertising and films
we went to sao paulo , where the computer is banned .
in the entire city , since five years , no poster has no poster , no poster , no one , no .
and we went to school , where companies are able to make their way in poorer schools , in all the americas .
the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got most of the feedback , or where i had the biggest success , these are where i interacted with things directly .
and that &apos;s what these brands have done .
because they were the middle of the middle , they also , they wanted the agencies , and they said that the agencies may not really have their interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artists directly .
i &apos;m going to work with him and create something completely different , something that people think is going to challenge us to challenge our view .
and how did that mean ? what it was successful ?
now , since the movie &apos;s movie , the rockefeller film was first on the boardroom film , we can see that .
and according to the first time , the first thing was the first thing in january , and since it &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million of these film .
that &apos;s actually just a period of two weeks of two .
this is just online -- no press , no tv .
the film hasn &apos;t been declining yet .
there &apos;s no time that it &apos;s not even online .
it &apos;s not in other countries .
well , finally , the film has gained a very big momentum .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every ad shows , with the people we recommend , their customers , the fingers of it .
something i think is that if you take your chance to take risks , that you can make risks that are in these risks .
i think if you &apos;re killing people , then you get them closer to failure .
i think if you &apos;re training your employees , to avoid risks , you &apos;re prepared to get a profit to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to have no fear of opportunity that maybe they might be able to get more .
finally , the progress of progress should be welcome to fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
they welcome the fear . they welcome the risk .
one big taste of it , so we welcome the risk .
and finally , we should welcome transparency .
today , more than ever before , we get a little bit of honesty very far .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; they &apos;re welcome to transparency , &quot; and they were told by my good friends of the ted service , the $ high school for ebay .
big data will transform for organizations around the world in big opportunities .
and the name is , &quot; they welcome transparency transparency . &quot;
thank you .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency , what &apos;s happening to the $ average ?
this is a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , in the front of the computer , the most marked of the street , the most violent -- a check in altitude of $ 7 , to fund my favorite year in the next year .
my name is a very poor name .
18 months ago , i did something else in google , and i &apos;m going to make something with museums and art . my favorite , i have the green light , i was going to have green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of the time of learning , and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and its access to this .
i grew up in india .
i was a great education -- i don &apos;t have a lot of education -- but i didn &apos;t have many museums and this art of art .
when i went to visit , and this museums started to visit , i started learning a lot .
and while i worked for google , i tried to do this yearning -- to make art accessible to technology .
we then put a team , a great team , and we started this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning .
so you &apos;re just going to be a little bit of the way to go to the street .
you can look around all these museums here .
there &apos;s the most dramatic , the moma , the most prolific , the most powerful , the van gogh .
i actually come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you get in two because it &apos;s very simple .
and the point is , you know , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you &apos;re walking around and fulfilling .
you want to push yourself in the museum ?
open the map , and jump with a click .
they &apos;re in , they want to be in the end of the gangs .
just further . a lot of fun .
look at them .
thank you , but the best one is going to come .
so i &apos;m now a front of my favorite , a little bit of the satellite , and i &apos;m in front of the turtle .
i see this ticking line .
if the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
this is one of the images .
these are all the defenders .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i &apos;ll click away now .
this is one of the images we &apos;ve collected with the so-called design system .
so , for example , this picture has about 10 billion of these , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you this .
you can get very easily pure and it &apos;s a very easy thing .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is immoral .
but then you really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i realized that there &apos;s something going on .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close , and i realized that these kids actually beat something .
i did a little bit of a bit of known with a couple of known things with met , and actually found that it &apos;s a game called the &quot; aw &quot; -- which is a goose , a ride on the top of the mountain .
it seemed very popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really go close to the end , you can go to the cracks .
just to give you the point of view , i &apos;m going to see you see what you get .
and here we were , and this is the painting .
but the best one is still -- in a second .
let &apos;s take a quick jump to moma , again , in new york .
another more of me , i &apos;m going to go .
and in the previous example , it went to find detail , to find detail .
but what if you want to stick the brush stick ?
and what &apos;s only when you want to see van gogh this masterpiece , you know ?
you &apos;re going to be in . you can actually go into it .
i &apos;m going to zoom in in one of my favorite books , to actually zoom in to the very heels .
this is a little bit of a time , probably never before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there are many more , but i &apos;m missing time .
this is the really cool part , he &apos;s called collections .
each of you , everybody -- the same thing , or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go ahead and build your own museum online -- you can put your own collection of collection .
just , you go in -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of the brain -- you can be able to do it .
this is the most popular , the most popular thing .
you can put all with a little bit of fun , send your friends , and so that you start to start with what you feel if you look at these masterpieces .
i think , finally , for me , the main thing is that all the wonderful things are not coming from google .
they &apos;re not even coming from the museums .
i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was a kind of humility for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to be just in the digital medium of art , and they represent it right online .
and the biggest question is , i &apos;m going to ask you , &quot; did you do that to replicate the experience of a football problem ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it should add the experience .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain , and your brain can split in two camps .
this is the left half , the logical side , and then the right half that &apos;s the intuitive side .
if we had a measure of the most of the hemisphere , we could show their brain .
for example , this one would be that one that &apos;s completely logical .
this would be somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you actually synchronize your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have decided to have one of these extremes , but i think , for most people in the audience , their brain looks like this -- with a high high school , the same in both hemispheres .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or something .
you can be logical and intuitively .
and so i see myself as one of the people who have other experimental industrial devices that need a good amount of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition to actually perform experiments .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love playing with things .
so we go out and play with it , and then look like it &apos;s responding , and then we start to develop our intuition .
basically , they do the same thing .
so one of the intuitions that you &apos;ve developed over the years is probably that a thing can be just at a place .
i mean , it can sound strange about thinking that a thing about two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve developed it .
i remember a child playing on a computer table .
he was a toddler and not very good at it , and he fell constantly .
but i bet that it taught you to play a very valuable lesson , which is the big things that you don &apos;t just let you do , and that they &apos;re staying in a place .
and that &apos;s a great model of the world , so long you &apos;re not a throwaway .
it would be a terrible model for a design , because they don &apos;t play with the football system , but with these little weird particles .
and if you play with your particles , you &apos;re all kind of curious things -- like that you &apos;re flying directly through walls , or you can be at the same time at two different places .
and so they all wrote these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
this was the physics of a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe the little tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need to describe the great day-to-day objects around us .
that didn &apos;t enjoy my intuition , and maybe because i don &apos;t often have any of these things with particles .
well , i sometimes play with you , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , nobody has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side doesn &apos;t like that .
because if all of the things made out of particles and all these particles of quantum mechanics , the rules of quantum mechanics should not be the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that shouldn &apos;t be .
so i would feel better with the whole thing , if we could actually show that clusters of physics is the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a few years ago , exactly that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see , which was in the most powerful fashion .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot in the middle .
this is the piece of metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
here i &apos;m going to zoom in . we &apos;re looking at the center here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little song metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little bit of metal it &apos;s shaped like a timeline and it &apos;s about the edge .
so i made this thing in a similar way to make a computer .
i went to a clean room with new york , and i went to 100 hours of all the big devices .
for the last little , i had to build my own machine -- to make this like a swimming pool and get the thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the most powerful fashion system , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i do all kinds of weird things , but then other people go up and i &apos;ll stop doing all these things because i don &apos;t want to bother them , or , frankly , they &apos;re going to
so quantum mechanics says that the objects are just feeling the same .
the fellow fellow fellow objects are not just people , but the light that seems to be on them and the wind that &apos;s going to be fed up and the heat of the room .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see that this piece of metal is acting on the surface , we had to get out of all the food molecules .
and we did that .
we turned out the light , put it into a vacuum and the whole air , and it &apos;s almost like almost to the elevator , and it was just the case of the metal , and it was the piece of metal , as it wanted .
so we measured its movement .
we found that it &apos;s really weird .
instead of just getting there , it &apos;s just like it &apos;s just a little bit like this , the way it was like this -- like this -- like a little bit of a car and together , and together , it &apos;s like a little bit of the
we gave him a little push in the same time , and we could vibrate in the same time , and not to vibrate -- something only is allowing in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m telling you is what really fantastic .
what does it mean to vibrate in the same time , and not to vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
so the first case : all the trillion of atoms that are the piece of metal is still silent and moving the same atoms on the same time , and they &apos;re moving on the same atoms .
just to be a very sophisticated voice .
the rest of the time are they &apos;re tuned .
that means that every atom to the same time is at two different places , which is what is called the entire metal of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it was worth the worth of time for all of these year , because , check the most powerful one between a single atom and this piece of metal , about just as much as the difference between the piece of metal and you .
so if a single atom can be at two different places , this piece can be metal on two different places , why not it ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side says .
so , imagine that you would be at the same time at a couple of places like that ?
how would your consciousness deal with that that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of history .
when we put it up , the light would be blowing up and the box , we saw that the metal was always in a piece of it .
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator actually are just the optical objects in a small space together .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says everything is connected .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s more deeper .
it &apos;s that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are , and that &apos;s the profound and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
in 2007 , i decided we should think of the way we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that if families think about where they want and work , they have the opportunity to pick up between at least one hand full of different cities that all are in competition for new residents .
we &apos;re far away from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries who are not even a single city that they would welcome to .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more value than they &apos;re going to build .
so we could just be very simple with the world , and maybe hundreds of new cities are going to be more of the new cities .
this may sound absurd for you , if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
now , trade just the building from apartments to the cities .
imagine half of the people who want to live in homes , did this , but the other half of them don &apos;t .
they could try to expand the capacity of existing apartments .
but you know what they would be in , in these apartments , and their environment are being emitted to avoid the laws of the way and keep out of the way .
so it turns out that it &apos;s very hard to keep all these big balls .
but you could go to a whole new place , building a completely new building block , as the laws would be there , and they &apos;re not going to be prepared to build it .
so i &apos;ve proposed that governments are creating new surfaces that provide enough space for a city and gave them a name : charter cities .
later , i found that , about the same time , the same time , and the challenge of a reform of reform in sharon .
they knew that every year , every year , they left their country to go to the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country and do exactly the same in hinduism .
in this place , what &apos;s the point of thinking about the world &apos;s brain , &quot; what happens when we &apos;re going to put a space surface of our country , what if we just put it in a message of the american embassy , a part of the
in 2009 , uzbekistan among a severe fashion system .
the next year , the other election , the so-called poor , the forbidden savage in a shift , the program , and the program , and the other innovation , was promised .
he asked for the computer to be on his own .
in the meantime , i was preparing to do a talk at tedglobal .
by improvement , and using consumers , i tried to try and reduce this complicated concept of the charter city on the critical elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t care more existing , you can &apos;t care about that .
we pay new technologies , but for the progress of progress , it &apos;s going to require technologies and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that we would return .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from guatemala sent the link to the tedtalk .
and that &apos;s what he did .
the two of them were calling me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s take the head of our country . &quot;
so we met in december of a hotels in miami in the prison .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , to be more valuable than they are .
and i used this chart to show how valuable things are in a place like new york . think that a surface in some cases is thousands of dollars per square meter .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , in a place than it was a pause , and he said , &quot; paul , we might be able to look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so the tedtalk in very simple form is that a charter city is a place that &apos;s the beginning of the country , a very , a , the law that defines the laws that defines the laws that are there and the people who have the opportunity to decide
so i was asked by the president of uzbekistan , who said that we need to make this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way that we have to move our country .
i was asked to come to the fourth and even the fourth , and then at january of january , one talk .
so i &apos;ve been given another one of the facts that have a graph like this , which has tried to show that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it must be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch represents the new airport that was built in manila .
and there &apos;s a whole place alone in the airport .
so i tried to convince the most of the time to build a new city , you have to start with a single area of at least 1,000 to a time .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
polite all of the time .
the audience of the audience were very serious and attention .
the director of congress came to the stage and said , &quot; professor , i thank you , i thank you for your talk , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i have him on my laptop here . &quot;
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and i came to the line that a new city offers the people new possibilities .
there would be the possibility to live in a city that would be in proteomics , rather than hundreds of miles away in the north .
and a new city also involves new possibilities for leaders .
the government of government in hinduism would depend on the help of the food system , they could benefit from their own , to make the laws that they put on the law for these charter and to deliver that everybody can actually get trust that the charter is actually
and the realization of president savage was that the glory of the gang i &apos;ve thought about as a way to get the foreign investors to come and build this city for all the parties in hinduism , which were suffering for many years and mistrust .
we &apos;re in a field of extinction .
this picture is from this place .
it sums up thousands of square miles .
and shortly after , at january january , they have been voted for a change for the constitution to have a change of a control control that is used for special amounts of control .
in a country that just has a violent crisis behind the congress , in the university of the breeding , with polluted , to a voice .
all the parties , all the u.s. companies , supported this .
but to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved twice by congress .
at the 17th 17th , it was approved to a voice of graduate students .
immediately after that election , between the 21st and the 24 february , a delegation of about 30 to the two places in the world , which was most interested in the business of the world &apos;s business .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new urban , which is built in south korea , and in south korea , big than the urban city .
all you can see on this picture was built within four years after it took four years to get the israelites .
the other place that was very interested in the urbanism is singapore .
it &apos;s been built in china , and it &apos;s been built in preparation .
so if you think about it , it &apos;s a convenient thing to do , where we are today .
you already have a more mature ; you &apos;ve already got this area to the second city .
it &apos;s been working on a legal system that is allowed to participate in the world , and it &apos;s also working on a external basis .
a country has already offered his top court to provide the court for the most popular system of the system of the system .
and also , it &apos;s very interested in the very world .
they even bring funding with one .
one thing that you know already was understood , there &apos;s a lot of plastic .
there are many of these things that would like to come in in america , especially in a place with a trade trade , and there are many people who would like to live there .
in the world , there are 700 million people who are telling you that they like to live in a different place .
a million people are leaving a year of america and go into the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to beat their families to work on work sometimes , sometimes they &apos;re single mothers who have to earn enough money to make food and clothes .
unfortunately , sometimes kids who are trying to find their parents back to the other , which they have , in some cases , haven &apos;t seen more .
so what is it for a idea to think about in complacency a completely new city ?
or even more , of those cities , to build , or hundreds of people around the world ?
so what is it for an idea to make that every family has a choice between a few cities that are in competition for new residents ?
this is an idea that is worth spreading .
my friends from uzbekistan asked me to say , thank you ted .
you know how many decisions you make in a typical day ?
you know how many decisions you make in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve done a poll recently with 2,000 americans and the average number of choices that are a typical american , a typical american one day is 70 .
and also , recently , a study was done with ceos that they saw a week for the ceo of the ceo .
and these scientists just documented the different issues that are being preoccupied with these ceo , and how much time they spent decisions with the issues that are related to the issues .
and they found that an average ceo is busy working with the ted task week .
each of these themes was from many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
only about 12 percent of their decisions needed an hour or more of their time .
think of your own decisions .
you know how many decisions you make in the nine minutes of a group of people in the one hour ?
how good do you think they &apos;re to deal with the decisions ?
today , i want to talk about one of the largest most powerful things of modern time , the most prolific .
i want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise it , because i &apos;m blind , just the hand if you want to burn some calories .
otherwise , please , i &apos;m going to ask you to ask you a question , and your answer is , so my first question for today is : are you ready to hear about the most of the time ?
thank you .
when i was a college professor at stanford university , i went to this very very very , very high ad store , at least at the time he was really exclusive .
it was a store that was called the most salient .
this business , it was almost like a football machine .
they had 250 different kinds of mustard and silks and over 500 different kinds of fruit and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was a time when we actually drank a while .
i loved it to go to this business ; but to a moment , i asked myself , well , how does it get you never buy anything ?
here &apos;s the olive ward .
they had over 75 different types of oil , including the ones that were locked in boxes , which came from a thousand years old .
so i decided to go to a day , and i asked the head , &quot; worked this model , &quot; works that this model , that you really offer people all of these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up on the top of tourists , which came every day and usually their cameras had their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment and we chose a study of our experiment .
here &apos;s her baseline of gear .
they had different kinds of species of data .
we have a little bit of a dna model right at the entrance of business .
we put six different tastes out there , or 24 different tastes , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i &apos;ve looked at what would be more people , and try to do it , and try and try and do it ?
it &apos;s more people left when it was 24 percent , about 60 percent , when it was six , about 40 percent .
and then we looked at what &apos;s the case of the people who were more likely to buy a glass .
now we saw the opposite effect .
from the people who were standing in 24 , they were only three percent of a glass .
from the people who stayed in the middle of six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of water .
now , if you calculate it , people bought six times a glass of glass , who they had six to vote when they had 24 to choice .
now , to decide not to buy a glass of glass , probably well for us -- it &apos;s good for us -- but it turns out that the most important thing is that the most important thing is that we &apos;re also affected by very highly effective decisions .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even though it &apos;s against our own best interests .
so the theme of the day : financial saving .
i &apos;m going to describe you a study that i &apos;m doing with a little bit of plastic , and i was doing a little bit of the way to do that , and we did the decisions that we were doing for retirement of almost a million americans from
and what we looked at was whether the number of people who were able to get a kind of a the driver that &apos;s the chance that the probability of the future is saving whether more for tomorrow will be saved .
and we found that there was a relationship in fact .
so in these plans , we had about the same plans that people offered to something between two to 59 different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund were offered that , in fact , participation was less than the rate of participation .
now , if you look at the extreme , the plans that have two fund of action , a more powerful one in the 1970s -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that nearly 60 fund , the most likely to have been offered , the most sophisticated percentage of the year .
now , it turns out that even if you &apos;re in charge of the way more opportunities to choice , even then it has negative consequences .
so the people who decided to participate in this rather than ever , the more possibilities they were available to , the more they get to grab them and choose to choose .
the more opportunities they were available to , the more they have their whole money in pure fashion .
none of these extreme decisions , to the decisions that someone would recommend , if you care about the future financial well-being , is to be important .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential consequences that provide that to more and more choices with each other .
they push the decision -- push it on , even if it &apos;s against your own best interest .
they &apos;re more likely to make more worse decisions -- worse financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re more likely to decide to make them less comfortable , even if they make it objective better .
the main reason that we may be able to enjoy this huge set of shelves of the brain , mustard , and the point of view , and we can &apos;t look at the comparison and we can &apos;t actually take the contrast and actually choose a little bit of
so what i want to suggest today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested on different ways and different kinds of things -- that they simply can apply in their business .
first , narrow .
they &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true of the world today that less than that .
people are always concerned when i say , &quot; narrow . &quot;
they always worry about they lose the damage .
but in fact , we see more and more , that if you &apos;re ready to narrow up , and the self-assembly of the kind of self-assembly , you can get the way to get the energy consumption , it &apos;s reduced to the cost of consumption , and it
as a master and gamble , the different head of head and the kind of 26 thousand miles of 26 , they had reduced a rise of sales to 10 percent .
when the golden corporation corporation sold her 10 on the worst , she experienced the most successful , and she was getting fed down to 98 percent -- a result of two , the rise of the market consumption and reducing the reduction .
you know , the average energy system today offers 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart is going to give you 100,000 products today .
but the most profound supermarket , which is the world &apos;s supermarket , is a little bit of the world &apos;s supermarket , and they only offer them 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in a doses .
now in the world of the world &apos;s genome , i think one of the best examples that have been on the market , the way you &apos;re best to make choices , was something that david &apos;s favorite is very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s going
every single harvard staff is automatically taking a single piece of a piece of life .
those who are really willing to make a choice , are offered 20 , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to do it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i ask the employees is , &quot; tell me how to distinguish the possibility of each other .
and if your employees can &apos;t be able to do it , it can &apos;t be your customers . &quot;
now before we started reading today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he would give all the people in this audience to offer a football vacation to the most beautiful street of the world .
here &apos;s a description of the street .
and i want to read you the ones .
and now i &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read them and then please please clap , if you &apos;re ready to take gary &apos; em &apos;s supply .
okay . everybody &apos;s ready to take gary &apos;s supply .
are that all ?
well , let me show you something more about this .
she knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who is ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve heard more hands .
good .
the fact that they &apos;re looking at the first time , the first time , had more information than the second time , but i would be able to guess that they felt the second time .
because the images were actually feeling for them real .
what i &apos;m going to do to the second technology that helps you deal with the problem of the problem is the most important thing .
it &apos;s about understanding people to understand the difference between the possibility of understanding what the consequences are associated with the individual possibilities , and that &apos;s how to express the consequences and have to be special .
why are people spending about 15 to 30 percent more if they use a credit card or a credit card , as a cash card ?
because it feels not that we really feel money .
and it turns out that if you make it feel specific , it &apos;s a very good tool to save people &apos;s people .
so we &apos;ve done a study that i made with a computer company , and we did a study of the people with the people who have done a study of the people who worked on the team of food -- employees who worked for all of them in a
and while this meeting , we have this gathering of the same way , just as you &apos;ve always added , just added to a little bit .
so the small thing we added was that we asked people to think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they save money .
in that , we did this simple thing , there was a rise of participation to 20 percent and it gave a rise of the number of people who were willing to save or a rise to four percent of the flow that they were willing to pay for the
the third technology : the main thing .
we can better deal with more categories than with more choices .
here &apos;s for example , a study that we made in a book of a book .
it turns out it &apos;s in the coastal industry , and the bottom in the northeast area , the number between the number of magazines , has been in the same way to get the number of magazines up to the very high magazines .
but you know what ?
if i show you 600 magazines , and you &apos;re going to show you 400 categories , or i &apos;ll show you 400 magazines , and that in 20 categories , you believe i &apos;ve given you more choices and a better kind of more powerful than i had given
because the categories tell me how to hold them apart .
here are two different types of dna .
one is called &quot; jazz , &quot; and the other is called &quot; the &quot; jazz &quot; .
if you think that the left is the left , and the ad is the actual jazz , then you clap in your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that the one on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is , you clap , you clap .
okay , some more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is jazz and the right is a , but you know what ?
this is a very highly energetic device .
the categories have to say something like this , not the choice of the choice .
and this problem often looks at you , if you look at the long bullet points all of these fund .
who are you actually interested in doing that ?
my fourth technology : assumption for complexity .
it turns out that we can do more information than we think we need to simplify them .
we have to slow the complexity slowly .
i &apos;ll show you an example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buy a car .
here &apos;s a german autopsy worker who gives you the opportunity to get your car completely to the body .
they have to make 62 different decisions to make their car completely .
now these decisions are different in the number of choices that they offer a decision .
and the car , the car , the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , gears -- four options .
what i &apos;m doing now is , i change the order of the decisions that make decisions .
half of the customers will be about the many possibilities , 56 of the many possibilities , to the low possibilities , four gears .
the other half of the customers are about the low possibilities , four gears , to the 56 of the way , many ways .
what am i looking at ?
how interested are they interested .
if you &apos;re constantly using the most sophisticated thing in the decision , that means that they &apos;re overwhelmed , the most important , i &apos;m losing them .
what you find is that people who go from the many to the low levels of drugs are going to go and keep the most powerful .
we lose them .
go from the little choice to the many , then you stay in .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is change the order of this information in which this information is going to be .
when i start with the simple start , i &apos;m learning how i &apos;m going to go .
even though the gears choose to pick me up , nothing about my preferences in the interior , it &apos;s still getting me to choose it .
it also ties into excitement about the great product i &apos;m going to get , and so i &apos;m willing to be willing to be willing to be with interest .
let me summarize .
i told you about four techniques that the problem of the world &apos;s brain council -- narrow -- will be the surplus alternatives ; they &apos;re going to be doing it real ; put it in -- we can engage better with more categories , less options .
each of these techniques i describe today is to help you manage the possibilities -- good for them , they can use them for themselves , good for people who provide service .
because i think the key choice is the best choice that you &apos;re picking up with .
and the more we choose to pick up , the better we will be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin gardner , and i &apos;m going to watch youtube , i look at youtube .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are going to be scattered , and then , after all , that &apos;s important .
we all want to be stars -- celebrities , singer , comedians -- when i was young , this was so infinitely difficult .
but , in fact , we have allowed to have that we &apos;re all going to be able to be famous or all our creative activities in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous to the internet until the next saturday .
but at youtube , more than 48 hours a minute , they uploaded a minute .
it &apos;s just a tiny percentage of that , just a tiny percentage of the line , and it &apos;s going to look at thousands of times and so on .
so how does that work ?
three things : the marketing , the unexpected and unexpected .
well , we want to .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
whoa !
so , the math system !
last year , the video of this video took this video that he filmed in the southern national park in the national park .
in 2010 , 23 million times had been looked at .
this chart shows how it was been popular for the last summer for the first summer .
actually , it didn &apos;t want a viral video .
he just wanted to share one rainbow .
because you &apos;re doing that , if you &apos;re going to go to the mountain mountain , you know , it &apos;s called a dead mountain .
he had uploaded a lot of plastic projects .
and this video was actually sent in january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was jimmy j. plumes .
jimmy ornish took the tweet , the video that was so popular after the last end .
because the way that jimmy fry us are going to make us new and interesting things , and show them a big audience .
it &apos;s friday , friday . pop down down down friday . and anyone &apos;s standing down the street , and , at friday , friday , friday , friday . friday , friday . and i didn &apos;t think we would have this conversation to be able to do
rebecca paravicini , &quot; friday &quot; is one of the most popular video .
it was almost 200 million times .
so the graphics looked like this .
it seems like &quot; double double &quot; seems to be the &quot; double double . &quot;
what &apos;s happening in this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other peaks are also more powerful .
but what about this day , this particular friday ?
well , the math of the math , it started to write a lot of blogs , to write about it .
michael j. nelson &apos;s science fiction was a first one that made a joke at twitter .
and what &apos;s important is that a person or group of internet scientists took a point of view , shared with a big audience and put it to the process .
and then these community formed the people who shared this big inspired , and they started talking about it .
now there &apos;s 10,000 more of them from friday .
already in the first seven days , there was a spoof for every single week .
unlike the most popular conversation of the 20th century , the community is the way we &apos;re going to be part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or something new from it .
&quot; the &quot; aw &quot; is animation and music in the field of music .
that &apos;s it , just simple .
this year it was almost 50 million times .
and if you hold that for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a more powerful one that has been looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
cats look at cats that look at this video .
it &apos;s important , the creativity , the most of the people who are in the world &apos;s office .
there were thread .
somebody made an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
a whole family set taken from the ground that made it a kind of silly joke to something that we all can participate in .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure in something , we do .
who could have all the relational ?
who could have &quot; double &quot; or rebecca black or rebecca , can predict ? &quot;
what would you like to write in the way that you could do it in which you &apos;re going to be able to do that ?
in a world where every minute of two days is taken video , only really unique and unexpected , as the ones mentioned .
i &apos;m not interested in that , i was not interested in a very interested friend than i said , i should look at this great video , about a guy who &apos;s carved in new york against bicycles for bicycles .
i got a ticket because i &apos;m not on the top of the street , but there &apos;s disabilities that don &apos;t let you go to the top of the world &apos;s life .
and that &apos;s the very surprising and humorous , and it was casey &apos;s funny idea , and his argument is five million times .
this approach is true for all new , which we do creative .
and that &apos;s what it takes us to a big question ...
what does that mean ?
the brain is .
what does that mean ?
and the creative business , creative design , is completely unexpected , the characteristics of a new way of media and culture to each other has access to the audience and the audience in the way .
as i said , one of the most recent stars -- justin bieber -- made his start at youtube .
no one needs to give your ideas green light .
and we &apos;re all feeling as a owners of our culture culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media and they &apos;re not making a lot of the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the conversation of the future .
thank you .
how do i talk about the connectedness between women about three generations , and how the amazing strength of this connectedness in the lives of a four-year-old girl , when they were about 30 years ago , was sitting in a little boat , and they were going to be
the story is not over yet .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s going to be put together .
i want to tell you about some of the most popular things .
imagine the first piece of a man that &apos;s burning his life life .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life has been given to each other from the simple hope of unity and freedom .
hold it in the field of the pack of the pack in the field of the way that he has to recognize that his life had been a single waste .
the words , so long his friends , are now , in his own .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken through the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him personally .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never has to let me forget his life .
i had to worry that it was not for free , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to crush us , we were going to be passed away .
the next puzzle puzzle shows how a boat was silent in the early york sea .
my mother may be 18 , when her father died -- already in a book of marriage , already with two little girls .
for you , life had asked her to do a job : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely lonely that it could fail .
after a four-year-old and a half horsepower , a boat silent boat was fighting on the lake as a police .
all adults were aware of the risks .
the biggest fear they had , rape and death .
as most adults on the boat wore a little baby phone , my mother was going to be a little bit of a glass .
in a computer scanner , i had only my sister and i , then she and my grandmother drink of it .
my first memories are from this boat -- the steady of the motor , which is clapping of a motor , the one of the most and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came out of many times , but the most of the men who were in the front of the men on our boat , or the most of the people who didn &apos;t want to start with the car .
but i remember the lights of the coast of the coast coast of the coast of the coast , and on the young man , the collapsed and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and on the taste of the first , the
no apple has ever tasted so tasted .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
and the next thing is , by four women , in three generations , which are developing a new life .
we put in the back of the class , one of the total monthly times , whose population is made of the population of the population .
unlike the most popular , the existence of me , the existence of me was not a very unknown , no more balanced .
the smell of the world &apos;s favorite came from the rest of the world .
and the high high school industry were between people , and they were in common , they started to go .
my mother worked on farms , then on a line of a wall , six days , twice layers .
it was kind of being able to find the time to get english and the most honest .
we were poor .
every dollar was given , and it was put in more education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to get to that , mostly the new things were coming out of the second hand .
two hundred hundred million nights for school , every one to cover the holes in the other .
a more nuanced way to the most of the time , because they had to go for six years .
and there were the rare ones , but they were very painful from &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; and here , and there &apos;s , &quot; asian , go home . &quot;
after home , where ?
something more interesting in me .
there was a meeting to reconciliation and a quiet voice , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go from the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we told each other to the day , and the movements of our grandmother was in the house .
my mother suffered at the boat &apos;s boat .
and it was my job to stay awake , until her nightmares came to her , so i could wake her up .
she opened a computer , then he made a business service and he opened a business .
and the women came with their stories about men who don &apos;t have the change , angry and more motivated , and they were born , and they caught children , caught between two worlds .
loans and sponsors were been searching .
centers were built .
i lived in the prison lab .
in one , i was the classic asian student , who was the environmental demands of himself .
in the other part , i was involved in insecure life , the tragic scars of violence , the world &apos;s trafficking and the isolation .
but so many of the years of aid .
and because of that aid , i was in the last year of the year of the year as young as a young child &apos;s age .
and i was made by a very high eruption of a car , and the edges didn &apos;t fit together .
tan le , anonymous , of the foreign , was now a tan , refugee le , refugee and social activist that was invited to speak of places that they had never heard , and in homes , their existence would never have been imagined .
i didn &apos;t know about the exhibition exhibition .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the most of the time .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go back to a routine and the comfort of life of an unknown , a grandmother , a mother , and two daughters , who had been so eager to have the other day of her day , and he had a little bit of the other
i said my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
she reminded me that i was so old as she was going to climb the boat as we got down the boat .
no one was never a chance .
&quot; do it easy , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about the world &apos;s and education , and the neglect of the world &apos;s rights and the most cosmopolitan .
and the more open i talked to , the more i should tell .
i met people in all the world &apos;s homes , so many of them were doing what they loved , lived on the limits of possible .
and even though i had my degree , i realized that i couldn &apos;t get a career in law school .
there had to be another kind of more different type of energy .
and i realized that it &apos;s okay to be a storyteller , a maverick , a new way to the image -- and not just all right , but something you need to be grateful , maybe a gift of the brain .
because the main thing is that the main press can lead to collapse , so easily , that you can mean the assumptions of the environment .
i &apos;ve gone out of my favorite room to know that , yes , the world is going to be , but not like you &apos;re going to be able to do .
possibilities that didn &apos;t have allowed it were proven , explicitly encouraged .
there was a energy , a constant optimism , a strange , a strange platform of humility and the most prolific .
so i followed my gut gut .
i collected a little team of people to go to me for the box , &quot; not a serious challenge . &quot;
we didn &apos;t have a cent for a year .
at the end of each hour , i cook a huge amount of soup that we shared .
we worked late in the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a few brilliant people , and we managed to do the breakthrough .
i met the decision to pull in the u.s.
just one journey there .
my gut gut .
three months later , i moved out and the adventure went on .
before i leave the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time in the world &apos;s brain , the social norm and the local majority of congress , the most important person .
life has not changed since centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mother was staying alone .
with 17 , she became the second woman of a retired girl whose mother beat her .
without support of your husband , she was worried about a great deal by taking it to trial and she was in her own case , and a greater big deal than she won .
&quot; it &apos;s not &quot; turned out as a perfume . &quot;
i just put in a hotel hotel in sydney , when she died . 1,000 miles away in melbourne .
i looked through the world &apos;s book and i saw them standing on the other side .
i knew she had come to say she was .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in southern kenya and sat around her passage .
we told her stories and assured her that we were still at her .
and to midnight midnight , the monk came up and said he would have to end the submarine .
my mother asked us to touch her hand .
she asked the monk , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because they &apos;ve been keeping them since today , &quot; he said .
&quot; they didn &apos;t quit them . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s going to be the women .
and you see who we were , and how life has shaped us , we can now see that the men who would come in our lives would come to the fake .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to have my own children , and i think the boat is still .
who would ever wish ?
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of privilege , ease , before the dismay of the brain .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous everybody , the wave , the most consistent , continuous , continuous , the engine of the engine , the vast horizon , which doesn &apos;t guarantee ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give this , and you could safely get it safe , i would do it .
and also , the fourth mother is here in the fourth side of the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it all photography at all ?
because this is a picture that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
but then my interest began to photography , when i received my first digital camera , in age 15 .
i put it with my former predilection for drawing , but it was a little different , because the camera was actually the process of planning in planning .
and if you put a picture with a camera , the process ends up when you squeeze on the trigger .
so for me , photography seemed rather about the right place to be right at the right time .
i believed everybody could .
so i wanted to create something else , something that &apos;s starting to get the performance .
photographs like this : a construction site along a much more potent road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and yet , there &apos;s a realistic level .
or photographs like this -- dark and more and more , but all with the shared goal , to keep a realistic level .
if i say reality , i &apos;m going to be tuned .
because , of course , she &apos;s not something you can actually catch , but i want to look like it , as if you could have that , on a picture .
photographs where you have to think a short moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about taking an idea , as really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it realistic ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we interpret the world , and how you can be able to make it in a two-dimensional surface .
it &apos;s not about what realistic is , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the basics are very simple .
i see them as a puzzle of reality , where you take different pieces and put them together to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we have three perfect physical objects that we can identify all of us in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , they can create something that still looks more three-dimensional than it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that it &apos;s not possible .
so we &apos;re constantly afraid our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t make sense that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in combine with photographs .
it &apos;s really just about combining different realities .
so the things that make a picture of realistic look , i think it &apos;s the things we don &apos;t think about , the things that we &apos;re not thinking about in our lives .
but if we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to think about it because otherwise you just see it wrong .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a reasonable outcome .
as you can see , that &apos;s not a very special picture .
but combine something special , but they can do something special .
so the first rule is that combined photos should have the same perspective .
secondly , combined photographs have the same amount of energy .
and these two images are going to meet these two demands -- from the same altitude , and the same thing .
third , it &apos;s not to make it possible to distinguish where the individual images start and end by connecting them into it .
it &apos;s impossible to say , how did the photograph actually put together .
so by putting color , contrast and contrast to the edges of the individual , and take a photographic tag , you can add a little bit of photographic paint , and you can see , the brain &apos;s colors , and the other , we can see the limits
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that it &apos;s just a landscape , and the bottom part is manipulated .
but this picture is actually completely composed , from photographs of different places .
i personally personally think that it &apos;s easier to create a place , because you don &apos;t have to get a compromise with the ideas in his head .
but it requires a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i would need several months to plan them to try to do the different places for the pieces of the puzzle .
for example , the fish was taken on a mountain screen .
the bank comes from another place .
the most salient thing is from a quarry .
and yes , i even have the house on the top of red red , to make it look a swedish bird .
so to get a reasonable outcome , it &apos;s going to be about to be on planning .
i always start with a mindset , an idea .
and then it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s a very good plan planned .
and then if you make good images , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite realistic .
so , it &apos;s all the tools there , and the only thing that we &apos;re limited to are our imagination is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic measures of this .
and i think the most important point is that we stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things that we introduced to the most popular was a computer plan , a computer company .
it &apos;s not very scientifically scientific -- she &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea , and asks the patients , families , relatives , &quot; how do you do ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the main problems , why all of the electronic people are failing , because we stopped listening to the electronic world .
this is my favorite story . a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button , you know .
and every morning i jumped .
and yes , i have a job , like you might recognize .
i have a job of 95 pounds of the way .
it works very simple : every time i jumped on the scale , you also send my data to google health .
and they also get off my favorite room , so he can see where my favorite , and it &apos;s not just in the moment that i &apos;m going to support , and that &apos;s what i need to do with a look at the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
maybe you &apos;re familiar with that , i &apos;ve got over 4,000 to twitter .
so every morning i jumped to my favorite and people talk to me before i go to the car , &quot; for lunch , just a little rubber dome today , the first thing that &apos;s going on . &quot;
but this is the most important thing that can happen because this is the pressure pressure , pressure , to help patients help , because that could be used against obesity , or it could be patients smoking .
but it could also be used to get people from their chairs , and to bring them to some kind of game , to control their health better .
it &apos;s coming down the market .
it &apos;s going to give this little little carbon chip that you &apos;re sitting on on an iphone or something like that .
and it will allow people to measure their blood pressure , to send it to their physician , and share it for example , to share with other people , for something more than 100 dollars .
in this point , patients come to play . they can &apos;t only take control of the course , captain on their own ship , but also helping us in health care , and the health care of health care , twice demand , and so on .
do the methods that are easy to use and start to hug patients in the team .
and you can do that through these techniques , but also by 23andme .
and one of the things that we did is i &apos;d like to share with you a short video .
we have all the main systems in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all the main machines around the world are around .
we know one where all the stations are .
and sure , we can find the sound of life .
but where would the next thing to do to help this patient ?
we have a lot of time , and nobody knew it .
nobody knew where the next cow toilet was going to be in this moment .
so what did we do ? we did in the netherlands .
we built a website , and we asked a crowd , &quot; if you see a car show , please share us with where he is when he &apos;s closed , &quot; because it &apos;s closed , of course , as it is closed .
and over 10,000 years of time , they &apos;ve been reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for that .
and we &apos;ve created a design system .
we &apos;ve developed an app for a drug set , extended reality to find this kind of light .
and if you &apos;re in a city like a city and somebody , you can smell , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks your brain &apos;s brain , to find the next little thing to save the life , save life .
and we don &apos;t just want to do this as a more sophisticated , as the product is called the product , but as a result of the product .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues all around the world , from other universities , to help us behave like the learning of behavior to the world &apos;s whole world .
and if you &apos;re in vacation and someone is collapsing , it &apos;s their own familiarity or somebody else , you can find a kind of a kind of a mess .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies are helping us in the world in the world &apos;s approval .
these might be the most powerful , or technicians for example , just to make sure that the most important thing that the computer &apos;s energy is still about is still on its location .
please help us and try and do it , not only to improve health , but to take your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to report from unexpected discoveries .
i work in the business business .
and my little bit of plastic wants us to force ourselves to force it .
... it &apos;s available to the approval .
here &apos;s a short video of what we do .
oh . a moment .
it may take it to be sent up until it &apos;s sent .
now , we can just skip that -- i &apos;ll just skip the video ...
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
so , it &apos;s ...
oh , my time is already over ?
okay . thank you .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design to take a year and work in a neighborhood that is so much everything that is actually , in fact , to work in government .
the program is called &quot; code for america &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the internet geeks .
we choose some fellows every year and we &apos;re going to do it with a little bit of work .
instead of sending them into the third world , we send them into the lab .
and they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what you really do is to show what is possible today with technology .
so they meet al .
al is a very popular in the city of boston .
here it looks like he looks for a date , but what he really looks like is somebody who &apos;s going to be doing it , when he &apos;s a little bit of the time , because he &apos;s white , he &apos;s not very good in the most powerful
how did he get to look for this particular kind of help ?
we had a team last year of fellows in boston , and the code for america &apos;s program .
they were there in february , and it has a lot of the time in february .
and it realized that the city never had these fire fires .
but a fellow fellow , a man named erik cousteau , noticed something else , and that was that the residents are free to free the sidewalks right before these parts .
so he did what everybody would do , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire fire .
you &apos;re going to lift up to him , if it &apos;s closed .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al .
if you don &apos;t do that , somebody can take away .
so there &apos;s a nice game game .
this is a modest little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of 21 apps that fellows wrote in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other species of affairs .
it &apos;s rapidly spreading .
there &apos;s this guy in the middle of the city , which has seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but to adopt the citizens to adopt .
it &apos;s very important that these are the work that these these things are working , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle decided to use the app to get the citizen to clean the citizens to clean up .
and chicago has just introduced it to the people who are the most powerful people who are doing it .
we now know nine cities that are planning to use this app .
and she &apos;s very prevalent , and it &apos;s organic , of course .
if you know something about the world &apos;s energy , you know that it doesn &apos;t usually work .
the kind of software is going to take a few years .
we had a team that worked last year in boston , for three people , two months .
it was a method that &apos;s going to find out with parents who are the right public schools for their children .
we had been told later that if it was about the normal channels , it took over two years , and it would have cost about two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not yet anything .
there &apos;s a project right now in the california law that has been driving the taxpayer two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so an app that &apos;s written in a few days , and then it &apos;s spreading from the kind of plastic , is a kind of shot on the front of the government on the institution .
it &apos;s going to show how the government could work better -- not more like a private company , like many people think that she should .
and not even like a computer designer , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , this app is that you &apos;re a new generation that the problem of government is adopting -- not as the problem of a mass of collective action , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good in the collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to make things effectively in common .
it &apos;s not just code for america , there are hundreds of people in the country that are getting up and writing , and they &apos;re writing every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t give up the government .
they &apos;re dreadful frustrated with her , but they didn &apos;t complain about it , they &apos;re not going to repair them .
and these people know something that we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s then , if you all get your feelings about politics and the snake , and all the other things that we really upset about is government , the core , in the core of tim o &apos; s , &quot; what we can do alone . &quot;
now , a lot of people have given the government to give up .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , please , i think you &apos;re going to be doing it , because things change .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government finally makes her power from us -- you know , &quot; we &apos;re going to say , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- how do we think about it , how this change is happening .
i didn &apos;t know much about government when i started this program .
and as many people , i thought it &apos;s mainly about choosing people in an office .
now after two years , i came to the conclusion that it &apos;s mostly in communities to go .
this is the call for service and information .
you typically come out , if you &apos;re in your town , in the geologic supermarket .
if you ever have to have the chance to work in your family design , like our fellow scott , scott , as part of the program -- did that , do all that -- you &apos;re going to see that people call government , including a lot of different
so scott gets this kind of crazy thing .
he &apos;s typing &quot; the &quot; bye &quot; in the official database .
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he starts with the computer model .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and play very loud music and see if the livestock is going to be the bad ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that wasn &apos;t the end of the world &apos;s rights .
boston hasn &apos;t just a call .
it has an app , a more powerful and a , called &quot; the &quot; aw , &quot; called &quot; the &quot; aw . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write this app .
this is a very smart work in the office of the new urban development center in boston .
one day -- this is a real report -- came in , &quot; the &quot; aw in my remote bin . can &apos;t say if you &apos;re dead .
how do i get them away ? &quot;
but what happens to &quot; the &quot; plastic &quot; is different .
scott mcdonough : human beings .
but on &quot; the &quot; bye , &quot; everything is public , so everybody can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post we &apos;ve got was , &quot; i went across there , the remote empire behind the house .
do you know ? yes . alive ? huh .
turned the air down . went home .
good night , sweet , sweet . &quot;
pretty simple .
this is great . this is the digital that &apos;s the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is to get into the approval .
but it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i &apos;m talking about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizen helped another citizen , but the government was a central role .
they were connected to these two people .
and you could have been able to connect them with government benefits , if that needed to be , but a neighbor is a very much better and cheaper alternative to government services .
if a neighbor helps the other , we &apos;re forcing our communities .
call the most sophisticated , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things that we need to think is that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they believe that one is the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is choosing .
how often have we chosen a political leader -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy to take a new political leader -- and then we &apos;re going to refuse to suggest , and we expect the government to reflect our values and have it really changed , and
this is because the government is like a sea and politics is the top of the top .
and what is underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with this contempt .
but it &apos;s this contempt that this thing that we have , and for that we pay , it makes something that works against us , something else , and then we &apos;re going to get ourselves .
people seem to think about politics , politics is sexy .
if we want that institution to work for us , we need to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the real estate is happening .
we need to go to the machinery of government .
so the most important thing is that it did .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of concerned that has written a very detailed report that has written a very detailed report to the top of the world &apos;s brain .
this is not political active , that &apos;s a gross active .
now , for those of us who have given the government to give us time , it &apos;s time that we think about the world that we want to leave our children .
you have to introduce the enormous challenges to imagine .
do we really believe that we &apos;re going to have to achieve what we need to do without improving the institution that can be in the name of all of us ?
a government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible , the function of government fundamentally , in a way , can actually achieve something that can actually achieve the society .
and there &apos;s a generation that grew up the internet , and the white internet is not that hard to do things in common , you have to build the only systems .
now the average age of our fellows is 28 , so i &apos;m , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up with the voice of the point of granted .
they don &apos;t fight that battle we all fight , so who can talk to who &apos;s possible .
you can make your mind , on every channel , and you do it .
so , if you &apos;re going to be faced with the problem of government , you don &apos;t care about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improve the work of government .
and these apps are using our hands to improve our communities .
this could be a fire fire , a peanut , a peanut , a trash surface with a plastic surface .
and sure , we would have these fire fires all the time , and many people do it .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government , and we &apos;re paying taxes and pay performance .
we are more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all got to you here : if it &apos;s about the big , important things that we need to do together , all together , will we be a lot of voices , or will we be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
and i mean , my role in the beginning is to explain the people how wonderful the new technologies are the rise of the market , and i thought , there i am under friends , i would tell you what i really think , and also trying to figure
i &apos;m going to start with you a single , boring slide .
... you can show the slide a little bit .
this is a slide that i &apos;ve been chosen to be from my folder .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide , but it &apos;s rather the universal form .
this slide shows data of a analysis of the performance of the power of the brain processors , compared to the performance of a mass area of networks .
the interesting here is that this slide , as many other things we find in our field , is a kind of a kind of a kind of a on a very high curve .
in other words , every step here is an ultrasound in the u.s. economy .
and that &apos;s a novelty that we need to use this guy on the surface of the technology in the field of technology .
something very strange happens here .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about .
so , if you can turn the light back .
something more disturbing , because i &apos;m going to draw something on paper here .
now , why do we draw graphs in technology on the ground of the data ?
the reason for that is , if i would draw it on a normal curve , where , say , this is the years of a kind , so the timeline of a kind of kind , and this is an evolutionary extent of technology that i want to be
so that &apos;s what you see .
and that &apos;s not what we &apos;re doing .
now , if i want to record another technology , we &apos;ll say a more nuanced , and then this would come up in the front of the scale , and it would come in a flat line .
but if this is happening , this is what happens , the most sophisticated circumstances changes .
so if the most sophisticated progression would be like the most sophisticated progression , then we could get a duck in a taxi and be in 30 seconds , and we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not what it &apos;s going to be like .
there was never before in history in the history of the world &apos;s history , these kinds of plastic growth , which is the scale of all several years of exponential .
the question i want to ask you is , if you look at this exponential curves , you can &apos;t go to it forever .
it &apos;s not possible that everything is always available and forever as fast as it is .
there are two ways .
either of it will be a classic , a classic , and it &apos;s going to come to something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen .
this is it in about .
well , i &apos;m a optimist , so i think that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do in the way that i &apos;m here .
and that &apos;s really , then , we &apos;re in the middle of a transition in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition of the world , to a new way of the world .
so the question i want to ask , and i &apos;m also often a lot of myself , is that how this new world will be ?
what &apos;s this new state that the world is going to take down ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing if you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was a future in the year 2000 , and the people were often talking about what would happen in 2000 .
now we have a conference where people talk about the future and you &apos;re found that the future is still in 2000 .
and we &apos;re not going to go on that .
so in other words , the future is melting up every year since i &apos;m on this world .
i think the reason is that we realize that there is something in it .
the transition is happening . we can feel all of it .
and we know that it &apos;s just not a matter of trying to make 30 or 50 years to the future , because everything is going to be so different that a simple one of what we &apos;re doing now is not a sense of making a sense of what
now i want to talk about what that might be , this transition in which we &apos;re right now .
to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things , which really doesn &apos;t have anything to do with technology or computers .
because i think that &apos;s really true to you , we need to go back to step back and look at the thing on a longer timescale .
and that &apos;s what i want to look at in the tents of life of the earth .
i think the big picture makes sense , if you split it into some of the brain projects .
so let &apos;s go back , and this is 2.5 billion years . the earth was a big , scalable , very much , very much lower .
now , if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized , then we have a pretty good picture about how they do the most powerful thing .
i also think there are theories that start to start to start with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit of a story of what is that that time is that , at that time , little oil oil oil levels are in the different
some of these oil oil caps were a special combination of chemicals that allowed them to integrate other chemicals from the outside and grow .
all of these were , they started rotating currents .
these little oil oil oil turtles were the most primitive oil policy .
but these oil spills weren &apos;t about alive in today &apos;s sense because every single one of them was just a little , conflicting recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , the chemicals in this have been refined chemicals .
so every monument was a little different .
in fact , the droplet grew , which had a lot of growth in the growth of the growth , and more and more , more and more of chemicals from the outside and shared faster .
so this lighter , more than survival , and it &apos;s doubling in the other way .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , if this droplet of the thing learned about abstraction .
in any way , which we don &apos;t really understand , this droplet of the ability to learn information .
they &apos;ve learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , and that &apos;s in a certain chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they found in this particular way , evolutionary way of a way that allowed them to make the most interesting thing that they were wearing , so that this information could be stored and copied .
the amazing thing about that is to store the information over the time of 2.5 billion years , where they &apos;ve been born , right .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same notation .
and that &apos;s the exact same thing that &apos;s used , and the same code .
we &apos;re like , we can only write , just for the design , even the thing in this code .
and i have 100 main pieces of a white white girl that i &apos;m trying to keep in airports from the field of plastic .
in this case , what i &apos;ve done is , i &apos;ve taken this code -- the code is made from normal letters , which we use to address -- and i wrote my business card on a piece of dna and have 10 ^ 22 times more .
so if somebody wants a hundred million copies of my card card , i have enough for everyone in this room and even for everyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
i &apos;d have been a kind of a design of mine , and then i would have written them on a virus and put it into the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the dna of dna was an interesting step .
and the most important thing that these cells -- it made them happy for another billion years .
but then another thing happened , very interesting step , where things were completely different , and they started communicating these cells and share information , so communities were born from cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually communicate their dna .
this is the reason for example , the consistency of antibiotics .
some bacteria have found how they can stay from penicillin and have this information together with other bacteria in dna and now we have lots of bacteria which are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate each other .
so this communication allowed the reasons of communities , which were in a certain sense of the same boat ; they were a lot of plastic .
so they either survived together , or they went together , and that meant that if a community was successful , all the individuals of the community were repeatedly repeated and dominated by evolution .
the most important thing is there &apos;s now where these communities are so close to the whole community that they decided to write the recipe for the whole community in a brain game .
and the next interesting phase took about another billion years .
at that point , we have communities , communities , of many of the world &apos;s diseases , which are acting together as individual organism .
in fact , we &apos;re also a community of a community .
we have a lot of cells which are not on itself .
your skin cells are useless without heart cells , muscle cells , brain cells and so on .
so these communities started building , so that the level of what evolution was doing is not the single cell , but the whole cell that we call the organism .
the next step is now within these communities .
the most important thing started to abstract information again .
and they developed special structures which did nothing else , to process information within the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the most powerful , which is built by these things .
they started to train specialists in the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding and they &apos;re going to be able to do information .
and this was the brain and the nervous system of these communities .
there was an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point , a single individual -- learning now happens within the time of a single organism , rather than over this evolutionary period .
so , an organism could learn to eat a certain bit of fear , because she liked bad and he made it sick , the last time he ate her .
now , this could happen within a single organism , whereas hundreds of thousands of years ago , because this information had to be learned by the other , because this information had to be learned by the individuals , because these are not the other things that were not
so the nervous system has the most powerful thing with this particular industrial system , because evolution could now be within a single individual .
they could make a difference in a context of a time .
what happened after that , the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
so as an example , the most sophisticated one of these things that are known as the human language is the human language .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , sophisticated and confusing idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here and basically give up sound sounds from me , hoping that a similar idea of creating a similar idea of creating a very appealing idea in your head , which has a certain resemblance with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , it turns into sound , a sequence of sound , and produce a sequence of something very complicated in the heads of others .
so this is what we &apos;re going to allow you to do again as a unified organism .
and what we actually did , we , we , the humanity , is we started abstract .
we &apos;re running through the same levels , which have been through the same levels of the tree -- the abstraction of our methods , how we put data , we &apos;re presenting to it .
the invention of language was a little step in this direction .
and the computer , computer , computer , vertebrae , and so on , all our specialized mechanisms that we &apos;ve built in our community to help us handle this information is to handle this information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and also capable of developing faster than we &apos;ve been .
so today , evolution can happen in the time of the microseconds .
you &apos;ve seen a little bit of the other little bit of dna , where he showed a little bit of evolution in the &quot; world &apos;s &quot; program , right before your eyes .
so we have the most sophisticated time of the time .
the first steps of history , which i told you , was a billion years a piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , is a few hundred million years .
then the most important steps , like language and so on , kept less than a million years .
and the next steps , like electronics , are just a few decades to take it .
the process is feeding itself and will be so , i think , i think , the word is the word -- if something is more sophisticated .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this explosion of explosion .
we see the process that lives from themselves .
i live living from computers and i know that i &apos;m using the mechanism i use to build computers , not using the time , without having a recent effort in computing .
my current activity is to design objects with such a high complexity that it &apos;s impossible to design this in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor in the ocean industry does .
it has billions of them .
what i do instead of thinking , and what the designers of thinking is , is , we think of a certain kind of thing that &apos;s going to make this machine and the machine that makes our skills more beyond that , better and faster than we could ever
and it makes it part of the way that we don &apos;t even understand it right now .
a method which is particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been doing recently is evolution itself .
we put a video in the machine , which is what &apos;s going on in the field of the field .
to call an example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program which evolved from random instructions .
we say , &quot; computers , &quot; please have a hundred million randomly randomly chosen sequences of instructions .
now , please all of these randomly chosen instructions , all the programs , and then they finally choose the ones which are my own , the next one . &quot;
so in other words , i first define what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to make numbers of light , which would be a simple example of what i &apos;ve been using for this .
so find programs that can be the most valuable .
of course , the chance of random instructions is very small that they just sort of put numbers of numbers , so they don &apos;t actually have the instructions to do this .
but one of those things that might be lucky to do is two numbers in the right order .
now i say , &quot; computers , take the 10 percent of the sequences , which are my favorite , the next thing .
store this one , the rest of the rest .
now , all the secondary people who have the numbers of the best address .
and that &apos;s with a method of the design of the brain , analog to reproduction . &quot;
take two programs and they produce children through the exchange of their body , and the children are exposed to the characteristics of the two programs of the two programs .
so i have a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that have come to the way that they were in the other way .
tell me , &quot; let &apos;s say this process . &quot;
so , kidney surgery again .
maybe some mutations might have a few mutations .
and try and do all the time with another generation .
all of these generations only need a few milliseconds .
and so i can let evolution go through a million years of the computer in less minutes , or in more complex cases some hours .
finally , i get programs that can make the numbers perfect .
the fact is , these programs are so much more efficient than any program i could ever write from hand .
so if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s anonymous and strange programs .
but they do the job .
i know , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re doing the job , because they come from a series of plastic programs , which have done the job .
because your life depended on whether they did the job right .
i sat in a 747 with marvin minsky , he was an isolated card , and he says , &quot; oh look . look at this .
and there &apos;s , &quot; this airplane is made from a plastic of plastic , which is to work together to make your flight safer . &apos; does it not make you a look at it ? &quot;
we know that a nuclear policy is not an optimal , if it becomes too complicated .
so we start to leave computers , for a process , which is different from the classic engineering engineering .
he allows us to make things much higher complexity than it would allow the normal methods to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibility of this yet .
so , it &apos;s been the technology that &apos;s been made .
we &apos;re using these programs now to make the computer much faster , so that we can be able to do this process even faster .
so it creates a nuclear reactor .
it &apos;s going to be faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies of today are feeding themselves .
we put down .
we &apos;re in a point that is analog at the time , as a result of the process of being developed .
so we &apos;re the most sophisticated and we can &apos;t really make what we &apos;re doing in the right here .
we &apos;re in the middle of this country &apos;s center .
but i really think that &apos;s something that comes to us .
i think it &apos;s very much more powerful to say that we &apos;re the final idea of evolution .
and i think we all are part of the creation of what &apos;s next .
now , the lunch is before and i think i &apos;m going to hear before i &apos;m going to go .
my story starts in rajasthan , in rajasthan , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert with the desert of the desert with a plastic camera .
we talked about it , nothing has changed since the time of ancient indian media center . &quot;
when we wanted to travel indians at the time , we were going to go to a car and a car .
now we &apos;re doing this with airplanes .
when the big indian commander had been rented , he took a bow , took a bow in the floor and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with the main machine and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic were replaced by machines .
i really did that sad .
i got a bit scared of technology .
it was scared of me that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without the ruler and without tweet to my friends .
i found that technology should make magic , and not killing .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver adhesive .
this piece 50 years old technology was the same thing for me .
she became a world &apos;s program to a world full of pirates and the images of the images and to images in my mind .
i was like , when we were sending clocks and cameras , we were dreaming of the mail .
they were inspired to be inspired by it .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use it to make magic rather than killing magic .
with 16 , i started illustrate books .
when i saw this ipad , i saw it as a device to storytelling , to connect readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it &apos;s taking pictures and text together , animation , sounds and touch .
the storytelling always took more senses .
but what do we do with that ?
i just go to the very simple , an interactive ipad app .
here &apos;s &quot; put your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s what this box is , &quot; i hear this box . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to get a character in the book .
and again , a letter for me -- and the ipad knows through gps , where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the child in me is really excited about this .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean a magician and dragons , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
fireflies found in a glass of a glass , i always found .
so you have to drop out here and tear the ipad off .
and the kind of light is the way through the rest of the book .
another idea that was fascinated with me as a child is that a whole galaxy can put in a very single patch of a cerebral .
and so every book here is going to be a little cerebral , and every world i &apos;m going to dress up here with the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
so , the cards had always been maps , but these maps were static .
this map grows and it &apos;s going to be in the rest of the book .
it also shows you about other places .
i &apos;m going in here .
it &apos;s important for me to create something that is very important , but it &apos;s also very noisy .
these are the most sophisticated ones .
we &apos;ve heard all of the world &apos;s and we heard about the most of the people outside india , but how many people outside india &apos;s indian colleagues are going to know ?
the poor were caught in the chambers for thousands of years in a old book , in a old book book .
and we bring them back to a contemporary history for children .
a story that are changing with new issues , like the most successful .
the theme of the last 10 years is a big problem for the last 10 years that children are sitting in their rooms , their computers , without coming out .
but now , with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you sent to a search . you have to go out and collect the ship with the ipads of the ipads .
when i was a kid , i had collections of the comic , rocks , and the shells , and the shells .
somehow , the kids don &apos;t do more .
this is going to bring up . you have to go out , to make a picture of a shot of a flower and tag it .
in another chapter , you have to be a piece of plastic , and mark .
so , you actually create a digital collection of photos that you can then put online online .
a kid in london shows the picture of a football game , and says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a fox . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
this creates a kind of social network about a digital collection of photos that you actually &apos;ve taken .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities to connect the world and technology to connect .
in the next book , we &apos;re planning to use an interaction that you use the wire of the ipads and through augmented reality , a piece of non-zero-sumness that appear on a plant before the house .
in a place , the screen goes on with leaves .
you have to do the sound of the internet , you blow it away and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the nature of technology are getting closer and in the magic and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and we &apos;re closer to the natural world , and we &apos;re going to get to the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in the prison , prisons , or the prison .
i spend most of my time with the social weakest in the world &apos;s most of the way to the world and in places that are very much hopelessness .
and at ted , to see , and listening to how stimulating this is , i have been very much power .
in the short time here , i was here , ted has an identity .
you can tell things about the world &apos;s impact .
and sometimes , if something comes over ted , it gets a meaning and strength that otherwise didn &apos;t have any of it .
i say that because i think identity is very important .
we saw some amazing presentations .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher is important , but that &apos;s the words of a dedicated teacher .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a doctor doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn that by the way in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i was big in a family , a traditional home household , which was dominated by an electrode , and that epidemiology was my grandmother .
she was a very powerful woman , strong woman , she had effect .
she had the last word in every single car .
she was also the beginning of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a computer .
their parents were born in the 1940s in virginia as slaves .
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped very much .
my grandmother was very , but she was also loving .
when i met them as a little boy , they came to me and gave me a ph.d. meeting .
she pushed me so hard that i couldn &apos;t breathe . then she got me .
one or two hours later , when i saw her , she came up and said , &quot; well , &quot; do you feel my hug , &quot; you know , i &apos;m still feeling my hug ? &quot;
and if i said &quot; no &quot; she said , &quot; oh , i &apos;m going to put them back . &quot; if i said , &quot; yes , i &apos;d leave you . &quot;
she was something that did , that she was going to be in her close .
the only problem that was about 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of her 10 children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention to it .
my cousins all over the world .
i remember , i have to have been eight or nine , that i woke up one morning , and i went to the living room . all my cousins was around .
my grandmother was at the end of the room , and i looked at me .
first , i thought that this was a game .
i saw her and smiles , but she looked very serious .
this was the age of 15 or 20 minutes , and then she came up and came over and came over . she took me up to hand and said , &quot; come on , you know , we have to talk . &quot;
i remember if it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out and said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you have to promise that you don &apos;t have to get it out . &quot;
i said , &quot; promised , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , &quot; i said , &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to know that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re something special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
then she said , &quot; you just have to promise me three things , &quot; you &apos;re just going to be able to bite . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; as first as first ever ever said , you &apos;ll love your mom . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby and you have to be with promise that you &apos;re always going to care about it . &quot;
i put my mother , so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother , i &apos;ll do it . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; when next thing is to me , you &apos;ll always do the right thing . &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , &quot; yes , &quot; grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you have to promise me is &quot; that you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south and i have a brother who &apos;s older , and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this metal beer to my sister and i went to the forest , and i went to the forest .
we &apos;re just going to go around there as well as otherwise .
then he took a drink of beer and offered my sister to one , and she took me , and then she offered me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . it &apos;s ok . it &apos;s just good . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , now we do this today , you &apos;re doing anything that we do .
i had what , your sister had what . go , a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to . do you do it . do you do it ? &quot;
my brother at the moment .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s going on with you ? well , what &apos;s going on . &quot;
and then he looked at me in the face and said , &quot; oh no , you &apos;re not always going to be crazy because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma tells everybody the grandchildren that they &apos;re special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to say something like that .
i should not do that .
this may be a public transfer to the public .
i &apos;m 52 years old , and i &apos;m going to have never a drop of alcohol .
i &apos;m not saying that because i think it &apos;s a lot of fun . i say that because identity means it .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell people about things that they don &apos;t think about .
we can get them to do things that they thought they could not .
of course , my grandmother would tell all of her grandchildren , and they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was in prison during the prison prison .
my uncle died at the expense of the disease .
and she believed that this is the themes we need to take care of .
i tried to say something about our business system .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
in 1903 , 300,000 people in the prison room were in prison and prison .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today has the highest risk rate of the world .
seven million people are on the galapagos , or cut with heated carbon .
i think of the world &apos;s brain change , which is fundamentally changing our world .
in social , black parts of the population , there are despair and hopelessness , because of that changes .
one of three male black black between 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , on the prison , or with cut down with heated .
in urban communities throughout the country -- from los angeles across philadelphia , baltimore to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all the black young men either in prison , in the prison , on the outskirts of melting , or cut on .
but our system is not just shaped by questions that have to do with the power of the problem , it &apos;s going to be replaced by poverty .
we have a business system that you have a lot better than you &apos;re getting in the realm of rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
wealth , not draw , is the result .
but we seem to be very pleased with that .
a politics from fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the contact .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a couple of things that are happening there .
my home class of alabama pulls them down to the right when they were doomed .
here , in alabama , 34 percent of male black population lost its right .
we predict that in 10 years the percentage of the civic population is going to be so high as the most prolific of the world &apos;s population .
the silence is a poor .
i represent kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , the most prolific children in jail .
in this country , there are children &apos;s development of life for children &apos;s life .
we &apos;ve got a lot of work .
the only country of the world .
i represent people in the lab .
the death penalty question is an interesting question .
we think because you &apos;ve taught us that the true question is : does a human being made for a person who &apos;s going to die for him ?
this is a very sensitive question .
but you can also think about it , depending on how we see our identity .
the other view is not : anybody who deserves death for a crime , but , have we made it to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the death penalty in america defined itself .
in nine people who we executed , we get to the one that we &apos;ve been guilty about as innocent sovereignty , who was crying and out of death row .
an amazing thing is , one of nine innocent .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never let anyone fly with an airplane if for nine planes , that &apos;s a crash .
but somehow we can do it from this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our struggle .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i talk about race and the question of whether we &apos;re right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i was an african-american story , and i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i talk about terrorism , the time against the end of the reconstruction , until the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
but for the african-american in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to fear themselves .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror , which shaped their lives .
these older people are now coming to me and say , &quot; mr , niall , you talk , you &apos;re talking to the people that you should stop saying that we should have to do it for the first time in the history of our nation , after 9
they say , &quot; no -- say , &quot; no -- you &apos;ve grown up with people that we grew up with . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , the somali and decades of the most motivated motivated submission and apartheid .
and yet , there &apos;s a dynamic in our country -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what the meaning of our actions have in the historical context .
we &apos;re constantly drifting together .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to be willing to approach the truth of the truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people have understood that the fuzzy is not to overcome the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , they were the willingness , but not in this country .
i &apos;ve been given some talks in germany over the death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scientists stood up to my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply troubling , you &apos;re talking to me . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death .
and of course , it can never give you in germany . &quot;
it was very silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible to get us to get to the systematic of people .
it would be a lot of us , consciously , and it &apos;s very precise .
i thought about it .
as it feels like to live in a world where german state people had to do , especially when they were a lot of jews , they were especially , especially , when they were a lot of jews .
it would be s-h .
it would be a trivial .
and yet , in this country , in the world of the old south , we &apos;re going to be able to be people -- here &apos;s the risk , to death , 11 times higher , when the victims is white , when it &apos;s black , when the
and yet there &apos;s this mental biped .
i think our identity is threatened .
if we don &apos;t deal with these difficult issues , the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but eventually , these realities are going to be driven by suffering , abuse , the droughts , apartheid .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we ultimately talk about that we need more hope , more commitment , more commitment to be able to be able to grow in a complex world .
for me , time is making time , and talking about the poor , the disadvantaged , the disadvantaged , who will never be at ted .
but think about a way that &apos;s embedded in our own life .
we all have to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re also rational , so we &apos;re really rational .
innovation , creativity , and development isn &apos;t just from our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the conviction in our hearts .
it &apos;s this kind of precious , which i believe is that you &apos;re driving us , not just to be open for all the bright and the other things that are the dark and the dark and the dark .
jinsop &apos;s , the great fortune politician , once said , said .
&quot; as we fought in eastern europe against the oppression , we wanted to do anything . but what we needed most , hope was a mental guidance , the willingness to be a reasonable guidance , and witness . &quot;
this mental orientation is the core of what i think is also about to have the most important thing to do .
there &apos;s no distinction of technology and design that allows us to be human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears for poverty , apartheid and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity challenges very much more of us than if we didn &apos;t take care of it .
it &apos;s going to touch them deeply .
as a young lawyer , i was privileged to meet the great privilege of making pink parks .
and the woman was coming back to the first time , and the woman was going back to the front of the woman , and the woman &apos;s elders had the older women who had organized the old women -- an incredible african-american -- and virginia , a white ,
so these women were taking place and they were just involved .
and then , on the door , ms. fry and said , &quot; well , &quot; the doctor park , the parks comes into the city . we want to talk .
do you want to come in and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very like . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
and i went over and just heard about it .
it was always so inspiring , so it was so naughty .
one day i sat there and listened to these women , and after a few hours , ms. parks turned to me , &quot; well , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to say , &quot; well , let me say what the initiative is right . &quot;
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go to injustice .
and the people who are willing to help people who were innocent .
we want to fight bias and discrimination in the business system .
we want to eliminate a current trade of life without any way of making children .
we want to do something against death companies .
we want to lower the number of death deaths .
we want to eradicate the rest of the world . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and then i saw it , and i said , &quot; well , &quot; i &apos;m going to go . &quot;
she said , &quot; it &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
then she said to me , &quot; well , he sat up to my face , and he said , &quot; and that &apos;s why you have to be very , very sophisticated . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i believe the ted community should be .
we need to make ways to make ourselves more of these challenges : this is the problems that , this suffering .
because ultimately our humanity depends on our humanity .
i learned very simple things in my work .
i learned a few very simple things .
we all are more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for everyone on the planet .
if someone is lying , he &apos;s not just a liar .
if someone takes something that doesn &apos;t hear him , it &apos;s not just a commercial .
even who kills someone , it &apos;s not just a murderer .
and because that &apos;s because it &apos;s a fundamental human dignity that has to respect the law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think that in many places that are the opposite of poverty .
and finally , i think , although it &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so stimulating , we don &apos;t have to be measured at the end of our technology , not to the things we &apos;re developing , not in our intellect and minds .
and finally , a society is not going to be measured by how they treat their rich and powerful and privileged , but how they deal with the poor , the executed , the 76 year-old .
because in this context , we start to understand the truly amazing things that make us .
sometimes i hit the balance . a story to end .
sometimes i push too much press .
i &apos;m going to get tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas are ahead of our thinking , in a very important way .
i represent these kids who were convicted of very hard fire .
i go to the street and i go to a client who may be 13 or 14 years old , and the one of the people who should be in front of trial .
and then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
how can a judge turn someone into something that he doesn &apos;t ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night i stayed too long and thought , my god , if a judge can turn us into something else , then he has to have a lot of it .
right , the judge , the judge has a double .
you should also want to be the wish .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think of it anymore , i started working on a bill .
i had a 14 year-old young young young boys .
and i started with this bill . the headline was , &quot; listen , my arms , 14 black clients like a privileged , white , white , white , white . &quot;
i was explaining that , in my niece , i was trying to take a fortune of the most powerful and the police and the police .
there was a crazy line about it that in this country , there &apos;s nothing more delicious about that country that there &apos;s only a mistake .
the next morning i woke up and didn &apos;t know if i just dreamed of this crazy bill or actually written him .
and i didn &apos;t just write him to my horror , but i was sent to the court .
a few months ago , i had all the time and i had all forgotten .
but finally , i decided , my god , i have to go to the court and this crazy case .
i went into the car and i was really overwhelmed with it .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s so hard to do that as painful .
finally , i went out of my car and went up the stairs to the court .
when i was the staircase to the court , there was a male man , black man who was the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came across me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and gave me a hug .
then he covers me in the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i have to say , there was power .
it touched something quite deep in me , identity that &apos;s the ability to contribute every single one , something to contribute to a community of hope .
well , i went to the street .
once the judge saw me , the judge saw me .
he said , &quot; mr. gelehun , did you put this crazy bill ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started talking .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
that i had written these crazy things .
and the street workers came in and office workers , and office workers .
in the middle of the world , the most popular thing was full of people who were angry , that we were talking about skin language , about poverty , about inequality .
i looked out of my favorite job , and i went down to the janitors .
he always saw through the window and he could hear the whole thing .
he went down and down .
finally , this older black man came with a very high school teacher in the kitchen industry and sat straight behind me , almost on the top of the street .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a pause .
during the break , a computer company was in the place that was locked up that the janitors in the lab was in the prison .
this is a little bit running across the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the world &apos;s office ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he saw the most popular thing , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m coming up to say that young man , they don &apos;t lose the goal . give them a hug . &quot;
i came to ted because i think many of you have understood that the moral pendulum of the universe is far more sinister , but that it &apos;s the justice of justice .
that we are not fully designed as humans , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and food rights .
that our entire survival with the survival is connected .
that we need to connect our visions of technology and design , entertainment and creativity , with humanity , and justice .
and i want to say , most of all , i want to say that just to say , lose the goal , don &apos;t lose the goal . give it to .
they have seen a obvious wish of this community , and they heard to help them and do something .
what can we do yet ?
so , tidying up , in fact , there &apos;s opportunities .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a whole spike in this spring where it &apos;s about a very important effort to do something from the most powerful , something that &apos;s going to flow in politics , which is otherwise in politics .
here , in california , for example , you will be a billion dollars for the death penalty for death for death .
and yet , 46 percent of all of the world &apos;s oil &apos;s not with a lack of knowledge .
56 percent of all the time of the entire trial is not coming before court .
there &apos;s a chance to do something .
this is a quantum record that will propose the money in more ways and security .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the most sophisticated is in america , huge down .
this fact is often brought into a context with increased water production .
what would you say to someone who believes that ?
now , the number of the children &apos;s rights doesn &apos;t change very well .
most of the most popular in this country didn &apos;t really look at the class of the world &apos;s class .
it was the most uplifting symphony against drugs .
so the dramatic high numbers come in the prisoners .
we have a little bit of the rhetoric of punishment .
now we have &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; system , which people get for forever bringing the other islands , for a health company , for a catastrophic , for the theft of good , rather than that you forces them to give their victims .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a food system , not less .
and i think our current way of doing no one is not helping us .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
and so , you have a string of it , you &apos;ve got a string of it here .
they &apos;re inspirational personality .
thank you for having ted . thank you .
bin laden is bringing a free one to be a free .
in somalia , famine in somalia , three : spray of the police .
four : more likely , the speaker &apos;s worth two : dangerous , dangerous .
six : social decline : 65 dead .
eight : nine : nine : a minute .
different speakers : mass weapons . oops .
recession . a standstill . egypt . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so these are just a few of the clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- but it could be the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media is asking us to show negative topics , because our minds are giving attention to this topics .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second every day , our senses will start much more information than our brain can ever process .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first stop to the rest of the information is a part of our temporal lobes , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early detection system , our main industry .
and it &apos;s the address and the whole information of the whole information for the quest to take care of the threat of the threat in our environment .
so if we see the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old adage , when it &apos;s a , is going to rise to the demand , the demand is true .
now , with all our digital devices , which we have seven days a week , 24 hours a day , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s not a miracle that we are pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that it &apos;s all the way the world is going to be bad .
but maybe this isn &apos;t the case .
maybe that &apos;s the reality .
perhaps the vast progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century is made by a series of forces that are so strong that it &apos;s possible to create us in the next three decades , a world of abundance .
now , i &apos;m not saying that we have no big problems -- climate crisis , water systems , water water and energy systems -- we &apos;ve already got .
and as people are much better at this , we have a lot better in the way that they &apos;re going to be in a long way , but eventually they &apos;re going to get to overcome .
so let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can predict the development .
in the last hundred years , the average life expectancy has doubled more than doubled that in inflation has tripled the world &apos;s population .
child mortality has reduced to a tenth of a tenth .
and that &apos;s what the most important thing is , the most important , more powerful , and costs to decrease a range of light .
steve pinker showed us that we currently live in a very peaceful time of the world &apos;s life .
and according to charles agus , the most prolific year is the last 130 years of 25 percent of 25 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations constantly .
in fact , we have redefined poverty .
think that a big percentage of americans who live under the poverty line are access to electricity , water , toilets , immunity , tv , tv , tv , air cars .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the most prolific of the earth , would never have been able to have these kinds of luxury goods .
the foundation for a lot of it creates technologies , and they grow up .
my good friend ray kurzweil showed us that every tool that is going to be able to do technology technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , is that the most of the 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s why the mobile phone costs about a million times less and less than a supercomputer from a supercomputer .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first , as smooth you can get -- in good times , war or peace , recession , depression and depression , depression and the food system .
this is the result of faster computers , the faster computer .
it &apos;s slowed down for none of our big problems .
and also , despite their logarithmic water , they &apos;re going up up .
so the growth rate itself is accelerating .
and on this graph , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available to all of them .
&quot; the &quot; aw , &quot; something that my friends in autodesk call &quot; the &quot; aw sensors , &quot; sensors and networks , robots , 3d printers , which allow it to democratize the personal production of our planet , synthetic biology , and artificial intelligence , and artificial
how many of you have seen the victory of ibm supercomputer at &quot; risk &quot; ?
that was great .
i &apos;ve been looking for newspapers and after the best headlines i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson &apos;s human enemy . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that these artificial intelligence had to be available to each owner of a single car .
four years ago , ray kurzweil and i came to a new university here at ted university , called singularity university .
we bring our students all these technologies , with special focus on how these are used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year we ask the students to create companies , companies and services , which can be made within a decade of billions of people .
think about that , a group of students today can influence the lives of billions of people .
30 years ago , this would have been ridiculous .
today we can refer to dozens of companies that have done this .
if i think of making abundance , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about creating a lot of goods .
now scarcity is a key , and technology is a very promising force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of syringes &apos;s history in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of the king of the dinner dinner .
and the soldiers were got to get the most talented , bullying themselves , and they were dressed .
but the king of the king of the world was got to be .
aluminum was at this time that the most valuable metal on the planet , more valuable than gold and platinum .
this is why the dome was made of aluminum , of aluminum theory .
although aluminum tapestries are going to be taking place from the internet &apos;s data , it &apos;s not as pure metal .
it &apos;s going to be connected by oxygen and water .
but then the technology of the world &apos;s technology was developed and made it so cheap that we use it with our own food system .
then let &apos;s put this analogy into the future .
we think today about the research system .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet of the mit with more energy than we use a year .
16 hundred hundred million energy energy is all packed on the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about scarcity , the problem is free .
and there &apos;s good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve been able to reduce the cost of solar energy in india to 50 percent of the average -- to 17 rupees compared to 17 rupees compared to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar water dropped in the last year for 50 percent .
last month , this has published with a study that shows that until the end of this decade in the sunny areas of the united states , solar growth is going to be nine cents per capita , compared to 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have an energy energy , we will have water in the abundance of the abundance .
let &apos;s talk about the world &apos;s .
remember that as carl sagan , the most popular of 1990 , when it was on saturn , back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a &quot; blue blue form . &quot;
because we live on a residential life .
we live on a planet that is covered to 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s a lot of water water , two percent of water , and we &apos;re fighting to be 0.5 percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new , new organizational devices on the way .
and from a conversation today with dean ornish , one of the innovators of doing it , i want to share with you -- he gave me permission -- he gave me permission -- his favorite , the &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; is called the &quot; the &quot; aw
it can produce a thousand liters of clean water per day -- whether saline water , polluted water , latrine -- and all that for less than two cents per liter .
the director of coca-cola just has a big , big school system to start a hundred units in developing countries .
and if everything goes well , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola will apply this technology globally in the entire planet .
this is a very important innovation that &apos;s there today .
and we &apos;ve also seen this on mobile phones .
you mean my goodness , we &apos;re going to get the 70 percent of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 2013 .
just remember that a car cell with a mobile phone in the middle of kenya has a better health cell than president reagan was 25 years ago .
and if you look at google on google , you have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication in abundance , like no one ever had possible .
and it &apos;s better , and the things that you &apos;ve spent , and i spent several thousand dollars -- gps , and photo , libraries and paintings , of books , of books , and music , technology to medical interfaces -- now , literally , more powerful and
and the best thing about that is perhaps what we expect in health .
last month , i had the pleasure with the most popular , the so-called &quot; $ 10 million million million million prize prize prize award . &quot;
we demand teams all around the world , all these technologies in a cell phone that can connect to them , that they can talk to the device , because it &apos;s linked to ai , you can test it or test your own color .
and to win , the device has to make a better diagnosis than a team of the world .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there is no doctors , but 25 percent of the world &apos;s population , and 1.3 percent of the staff of health care .
if this device sequenced a car , or a more energetic , it &apos;s called the insurance insurance system , and it &apos;s stopping the pandemic , and it prevents a pandemic before you get .
but now , the biggest power that &apos;s going to lead us to a world of abundance .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the air movement .
and by the way , the biggest most participatory versus population explosion is a better education and nutrition in the world .
in 2010 , we had just in two billion people online .
we go through the mountain of two billion users in the world .
three billion new minds that we never heard before , will be involved in global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what will you want ?
and instead of economic gridlock , i see one of the largest economic systems of history .
these people represent multiple trillion dollars that will flow into global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be getting healthier , and they &apos;re trained to get better through the oil industry , and they &apos;re getting the opportunity to get the structure and the more productive than ever before .
so what can three billion growing , healthy , productive , productive members of the world &apos;s brain .
as it would be with a sentence , it would never be a new set of voices before .
how about it , the oppressed , where they &apos;re always giving a voice to make attention and create change , the first time ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
how about the case of the way that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned from the x prize is that small teams that motivated by passion and focus are extraordinary things , things that could create the great companies and governments only in the past .
i want to conclude with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that might have already known some .
it &apos;s a game called foldit .
it was developed in seattle in seattle in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to explore how the protein is going to evolve .
and after his behavior , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the business industry .
so , this was a supercomputer for supercomputer .
and this game was played by professors .
and it &apos;s now hundreds of thousands of people playing the game online .
and it showed that today the human pattern pattern is better than the same supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked , who &apos;s the best most popular world , it wasn &apos;t a very bad , no more powerful , it was somebody from england , manchester , a woman who was working in the day as a assistant of the world &apos;s
ladies and gentlemen , what makes me incredible trust in our future is that we have more power than individuals to ask us to provide the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to an exponential technology .
we have the passion of a computer project .
we have the capital of the world &apos;s capital .
and we have three billion new minds that we can work on to be able to master the new challenges , and to do what &apos;s needed .
we expect some extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something about a design of medical culture .
and i think it &apos;s starting to start with a medical doctor and i &apos;m .
and maybe i &apos;m a long enough time in business , when i can give it to a piece of my own fake to give this a piece of self .
but before i &apos;m going to talk about the actual theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re the most complete , and we &apos;re moving to the world cup .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of fantastic statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; the &quot; aw &quot; seems soon and it turns around statistics and to use this great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to be interested in a statistics that i hope most of you have heard about .
it &apos;s the most powerful of the world &apos;s brain .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 , if a bat beat 300 .
that means that the player is safe three beats .
that &apos;s what the ball is going to be in the computer , he &apos;s going to get it , and he &apos;s not caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball to the first base , it didn &apos;t happen in time and the driver &apos;s track
three out of 10 out 10 .
do you know how to call a car camera in a residential league of baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a more mature .
you know how to call a car test ?
that &apos;s somebody who &apos;s safe at the rest of the world .
and the last time ted williams -- the last ted league baseball player , the last year of the baseball , the next season of the prison , was met by a standard season .
let &apos;s go back to my world of medicine , which i feel much more comfortable or maybe a little less likely to do with them , and i &apos;ve talked about them .
imagine a more nuanced and you &apos;re going to be exposed to a wooden test , which is 400 in terms of 400 in terms of the water .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
imagine in a certain remote area , and you have a beloved people with clogged , and they have a little bit of the people who have a laser company that &apos;s at 200 , which is at 200 .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better . it &apos;s on the kind of branch .
and she &apos;s beating a giant .
somehow it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you think the most popular thing for a car or a nurse or a nurse or a nurse should be a , a computer company ?
1,000 , very good .
the truth is that nobody in the entire era knows what a good surgeon or doctor should be .
but what we do is we &apos;re doing every one of them , including me , in the world , to be perfect with the claim .
never a mistake , but nobody does it , but what this is going to be done is how to do this .
and that &apos;s the message i put in medical school .
i was a lesbian student student .
in high school , a fellow was told that brian was going to learn for a blood test .
and so it was .
and i learned in my little book in the nurses in the sisters , and i learned the toronto , the math of here .
i learned everything .
in my favorite business , i learned the origins and the tail every single car , every branch of a artery , which is from the aorta , isolated and ordinary , ordinary .
i even knew the most sophisticated news system to classify the most sophisticated plastic system .
and i &apos;ve been spending more and more knowledge .
and i was good , i went to the head of glass .
and i left medical school with the impression that i knew if i knew everything , or anything , or at least as much as possible , as close as possible , i was immune to the kind of mistakes .
and it worked for a time until i met ms. printer .
i &apos;m going to a school school in toronto , and i was brought into the hospital &apos;s hospital , and i was brought into the hospital of the hospital .
at that point , i was the most troubled layer in the prison service .
and it was my mission when the most successful advice of advice was to study the most powerful thing .
and feedback to my favorite .
i studied ms. printer and she was in a hospital .
and when i get to join her , she made it sound sounds .
and when i was doing her chest with the metal of the day , i could hear a nuclear sound on both sides that said to me that she suffered under the heart failure .
this is a state of the heart that &apos;s failed to pump the entire blood , and it &apos;s a part of the blood tissue in the lung , and it &apos;s going to get that gradually , so the most important thing came out of the blood .
and that was not hard to be diagnosed with .
i put them and made me care about the treatment .
i gave her her encrypted . i gave her medicine to take the pressure from the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call the water , water , so she had the liquid .
and over a period of a year , one to two hours , she started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake ; i sent them home .
actually , i made two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my own school .
i didn &apos;t take the catch and i did what i would have , what would have been a call in my favorite book to make it a chance to make it a chance to make a chance .
and he knew it , he would have been able to get more information to her .
maybe i did it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the most popular doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so capable of taking responsibility that i was so much like that , and i would be able to get my patients to come to my patients without getting to contact it .
my second mistake was worse .
so that &apos;s what i sent you home , i &apos;m a quiet voice in me , and i tried to say , &quot; goldman sachs , not good idea . do not do it . &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s really very missing to me that i asked the nurse to ask the nurse , &quot; believe it in order to go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and he said in the way that i think , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to be good . &quot;
i remember it was yesterday .
so i cut the air and an ambulance and a builder and brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest day , i had this nagging feeling in my stomach .
but i continued to work .
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my things , and i was going to go to the hospital and go back to the car to go home with the car , when i did something that i didn &apos;t do .
i went home through the street of my way home .
and there was another nurse who had seen the sister that had been looking for women , but to me , another three words , and fear the three words that i know about .
other medical doctors fear these as well , but the role of the care is very , very , very sophisticated because we see the patients just so volatile .
the three words loud : remember , do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient you &apos;d send home ? &quot;
asked the nurse , foreplay .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said in this particular kind of state .
so she was back .
she was back and she was dying .
about one hour after you got home , after i sent her home , she collapsed and she called the family , she would bring her back to the top of the water with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous motivator .
they barely breathe and was blue .
the most sophisticated thing was all refined strands .
they gave her their ass .
she &apos;s rolling her on the top of the world .
i was shocked and to the inside of the brain .
and i went through this rollercoaster because they came to the intensive care room , and i hoped they would recover .
and after two , three days , it was clear that they never would again be awakening .
she didn &apos;t have a hungarian military &apos;s war .
their family had been together .
and in the course of the next eight or nine days , they did the most natural .
at the time day , they go to them -- ms. printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say you &apos;re never hearing the names of the world &apos;s names .
and that was the first time i learned this myself .
the next weeks i made myself , and i learned for the first time myself , the unhealthy shame , which exists in our medical culture -- i felt isolated , not the way of healthy shame , which you can &apos;t talk about because you can &apos;t talk about
you know , you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret of the best friend , even though this one on the top of the world &apos;s brain and you get caught and the best friend is going to be able to get one and a
if you &apos;re doing it , you never make the mistakes again .
that &apos;s the kind of plastic of shame .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is the one in the middle of the bathroom .
it &apos;s the one that says that it &apos;s not what you did , it &apos;s not what you did , but you &apos;re bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t because of my favorite , he was very , very dear .
he spoke with the family and i &apos;m sure he &apos;s going to be the medicines waves and i &apos;m sure that i wouldn &apos;t be sued .
but i asked myself to ask these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the most of the time ? why would i send them home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a dumb mistake ?
why went to medicine ?
but slowly , it would be safe .
i started feeling better .
and then on a street day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke up and i might say i could feel better again .
and i was with me that if i doubled my efforts to perfection and never again a mistake , the voice could be the voice .
and she did it .
and i continued working .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the prison department in a hospital hospital in a hospital hospital north of toronto , and i scraped a 25 years old with the old man .
it was a lot of los versa , and i &apos;m in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked at the radio and it was a little bit pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on .
and yet , when he went out of the door , he showed up his shoulder .
two days later , i came to my next school and my favorite book , and my favorite office asked me to talk to her office .
and she said the three words : do you remember ?
&quot; do you remember the patient with the &quot; the patient &apos;s test ? &quot;
it turns out he was a computer company .
he had potentially a potentially unfair disease called the &quot; internet . &quot;
you can google , but it &apos;s not infection of the most powerful , but the upper sea level and the breaks down the line of the road .
and fortunately , he died not .
he got a little bit of the time , and he recovered a few days later .
and i went back through the same kind of honor of shame and self-doubt , and i felt free and went to work to work until it was again and again and again .
in a training game , i &apos;ve missed two times a computer test .
there &apos;s a lot of time to think about that , especially if you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital that has only 14 patients a night .
i didn &apos;t take them home , and i didn &apos;t think they were a geek in their treatment .
i thought he had a little bit of a game .
i &apos;m going to put the x-ray in the kidney , when that was without a throwaway , my colleague in the front of the patient was in the bottom of the patient , and called the surgeons , the surgeons , the surgeons , and they called the surgeons
the other had strong diarrhea .
i &apos;m going to go to the street to get him to be able to put my colleagues and asked him to examine my colleagues .
and he did and he was a computer company in the right , and he was called the surgeons , he called the surgeons .
in both cases , it was been a good and it was good to them .
both of the cases of mine , i &apos;m on , i &apos;m on .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst mistake happened only in the first five years , which is a lot of my colleagues say , but total nonsense is .
some of my favorite students happened in the last five years .
alone , and no support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t close with my mistakes and talk about them , if i &apos;m quiet , who &apos;s really not going to find me what &apos;s really happened to me , how can i actually share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so that they don &apos;t commit the same ?
if i was in a room -- now , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking about me .
when did you hear the last time of someone who &apos;s heard about the world &apos;s most of the world &apos;s head of energy ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you may hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about your own mistakes .
if i was in a room with colleagues , and to tell their immediate support , and to tell them what i &apos;ve just told you , i would not have the end of the second story before it really would be uncomfortable , and you would be able to
and in fact , if i knew or my colleagues that a computer teacher would have taken the wrong leg in my hospital , you think i &apos;d have trouble looking at the eyes .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a completely denial of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system that is two basic positions -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t do any . those who are sleeping with sleep and the ones that are doing with bad results and the good results .
it &apos;s almost an ideological response as antibodies , which attack a human being .
and there are the idea that if we &apos;re advising those who are thriving from medicine , we will have a secure system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of medical school , and journalism , i have a personal medical study of medical errors and wrong treatments to make all of me for a first article that i &apos;m going to show the white , white art , black art , black art
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely valid .
we &apos;re working in a system in which every day , in the way that one of 10 major things are either false or wrong , in which the congestion maintenance system is always going to be and cause the same and the devastation or dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canadian jones die of the sound of a drug .
in the united states , the institute of medicine took the number of 100,000 .
both of these are strong , because we don &apos;t think of the problem as we should .
and it &apos;s the most important thing .
in a training system that the medical system is all doubling , we can &apos;t keep up .
sleep is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive error , so we can take a perfect piece of a patient with a patient with pain .
then i take the same patient with the same patient , making it , and then give it a little bit of freedom and a little bit of freedom to get it and suddenly be modified with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same journey .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are not cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms always in the same way .
all of this is the mistakes that are inevitably unavoidable .
so if you take the system , as i was taught , and all the main bits of all the time , it &apos;s the end of the day .
and you know the most important thing about people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white , black art , &quot; i have a habit to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to everybody from the ted book to the ted department of the world &apos;s book , &quot; this is my worst
and then their lawn , they &apos;re pushed off the head , and they look down and they &apos;re very difficult to tell them , and they &apos;re going to start telling their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
you want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake that i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
what you need is a environment that you can get into the situation .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new doctor is a human being , white , white , and you know , not proud of making mistakes , but it &apos;s not going to be a little bit of learning to learn about it , so it can be passed away .
they share their experiences with other people .
they support them when they &apos;re talking about their mistakes .
and they show other people &apos;s mistakes , not to be more powerful , but in a loving , supportive way of all of them .
and she works in a medical culture that recognizes that people fill the system with life and when it &apos;s , then people are too concerned at time .
so that the system is going to be able to create the way that you can make a simpler mistake that people inevitably are capable of making , and it &apos;s also allowed to create a lot of supportive spaces , in which everybody is looking at the health care
my name is brian goldman sachs .
i &apos;m the new doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i &apos;m making mistakes .
but i &apos;m filming , but i &apos;m trying to learn best from that to get to others .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re holding from me , but i can live .
let me close with three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about the most powerful thing .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;ll tell you three stories to use the time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he was in 1835 .
you may think that he &apos;s dressed out , but that &apos;s not true .
actually , he collected fish .
he described one of them as a very , usually .
it was a computer scientist .
and in the &apos; 80s , he was stuck in great style .
now he &apos;s listed in the red list of the red list .
and this story we heard many times from the galapagos or other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we still come on the galapagos .
we still think they &apos;re originally .
the most popular thing is that they still describe as pristine .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is to be a different concept that &apos;s the most important thing that &apos;s going to show you .
because i experienced it when i was in 1971 in 1971 .
i went there because i grew up in europe and i wanted to work in africa later .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a terrible crane , and i was convinced that i really didn &apos;t think of it .
it was my first cloned .
as you see , the lagoon was from palms and some of the trees of the wooden twin .
there was a little bit of the paper , and it was about 20 inches , a crocodile of the world &apos;s brain .
the fisheries of these miniature centers were very productive and the fishermen lived well and made in ghana above average .
when i returned to 27 years later , the fish was blown up half his size .
adults are measuring five centimeters .
they were genetically modified .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had happiness to be there .
so it doesn &apos;t change , and yet it &apos;s changed all the time .
my third little story talks about my favorite story in southeast asia in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- more at the beginning of the 1960s -- a lot of the world &apos;s -- a lot of the internet .
and the other thing that was called the countries that started 100,000 fish , the industrial fishing , is called the industrial fishing ship of this pretty ugly ship .
i went to this and we did the census of the southern ocean ocean , and particularly in the south pacific .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started there .
i know that it was the bottom of the ocean .
90 percent of our family students were sponges , other animals who are connected to the reason .
the largest part of the fish , the small dots on the rubble , were the most powerful , the most powerful .
basically , the bottom of the ocean came back to deck and then thrown back .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is very quick .
within a year , you run an announcement and then starts with the commercial fishing .
the reason is that it &apos;s going to change . it &apos;s in this case -- a hard reason or soft coral is being made .
this is a dead turtle .
they weren &apos;t eaten , you threw them away , because they were dead .
once we started a living .
she wasn &apos;t going to get caught .
then they wanted to kill them because they could eat it well .
in fact , this mountain is actually planted from the rubble every time you drive in areas where they &apos;re never fish .
but it &apos;s not being documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we &apos;re putting our online capacity to the new level , and we don &apos;t call us in memory .
if you &apos;re going to get it , this is what happens .
on the y-axis , some good things : biodiversity , number of the world &apos;s brain , the green of your country , the most prolific .
it &apos;s time to change it . it changes because for people , their actions are very , natural actions .
every generation of the images that they take in their own conscious life as a standard and it &apos;s going to get everything that &apos;s going to happen .
the difference is being seen as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
there can be a order of changes .
and at the end , they just want to get the most sophisticated remains .
that &apos;s largely our goal .
we want to get things that are gone , or things that are not like that , as they were .
you could think that the problem was people who certainly lived in the world , and they were killing animals , and they were only being aware of a few generations , which they had done .
because obviously a animal that has been very often , just once before it &apos;s a little bit of time .
so you &apos;re not very often losing animals .
you lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not being seen as a lot of loss .
and at the time , we &apos;re focusing on the great animals and the ocean , the big fish .
they &apos;re rare because we &apos;re going to start .
and the time is , the time is left , and we think that &apos;s the most powerful thing .
the question is why people accept this .
now , because you don &apos;t know it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , they &apos;re actually in the other way .
they will confirm it because the evidence , as they are in a former form of references , are not like they would like to be able to reflect the evidence .
for example , there &apos;s the anecdote that the report of a computer report that watched big amounts of time can &apos;t be used , or not being used by the research of the scientific , because he &apos;s not scientific .
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in educated societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous big role that can play a marine reserve .
because in the field of marine sauce , we basically put the past back .
we &apos;re going to ask the past to get people to understand , because the most important thing that people have changed is very low .
so people who can see a marine reserve and benefit from the grasp that allows you to anticipate their own value .
what about the people who don &apos;t have that possible because they don &apos;t have access to the people in the middle west for example ?
here , i think , the art and the film may fill the gap , and simulations .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there was a lot of time -- 500 years ago .
and the most important thing , you might remember , &quot; avatar . &quot;
if you think about &quot; avatar , &quot; if you think about why people were so touched by this -- except from the most important , why were they so touched by the most important ?
because it &apos;s something that has been lost in a way that &apos;s lost in a way .
so my only one i &apos;m going to give you is , i &apos;m going to focus on cameron , so he &apos;s spinning &quot; avatar ii under water . &quot;
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist , you had to have a typewriter , you had to see that in the government , that was the government .
they also had to shine a sheet of glass from this typewriter .
the reason for this : the government could trace out where a text came from .
and they found a paper with a video article , they could detect the creator of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do something like this , and how much the speech of the speech would be emitted .
in our own countries , we would never do something like this .
but if you buy a new state of 2011 in the world today , and you print a page , then this page has light yellow on every page , on a pattern that makes the site clear on you and your printer , which is clearly a little bit
that &apos;s what happens today .
and nobody &apos;s like that , no one .
and that was an example of what our own governments are doing to us , the citizens , the citizens , use .
and this is one of the three main things that are emerging today .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s really happening in the world : we can divide the attacks in categories .
we have three main projects .
there are superstar plumes .
for example , this is mr. floyd &apos;s most popular , in ukraine .
and the motives of the main community are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use the search of money to make a lot of money , a huge pile of money .
there are several known cases of the most famous , recyclable , which you have made money through attacks .
this is a video of the plastic &apos;s , from northern estonia .
this is alfred floyd .
stephen watts .
the silver dissection system .
these are matthew anderson , and so on and so on .
these people have come up to wealth , but they &apos;ve acquired it , by using the horses to get money out of our bank , while we do our online media , or the more , we &apos;re going to get a professional computer online , while we go
the u.s. intelligence agency in front of two months ago , the swiss &apos;s map of mr. sam harbor here , and on this program , the inertia million dollars , when it was frozen .
mr. jain himself is on free feet , the downs is unknown .
and i &apos;m saying that today , we &apos;re more likely to become victims of a human being as a crime in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is going to be worse .
in the future , most crimes are going to play online .
the second largest largest technology that we can observe today is not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- protests , one opinion , or by their audience .
groups like anonymous are moved over the last 12 months , and they have become one of the most profound ones on the field of the field of the world .
so these are the three main elements : criminals who do it for the money because they &apos;re doing anonymous , which is how anonymous , but the last group are nations , governments , the attacks that lead attacks .
and there &apos;s a lot of time that we &apos;re looking at how the most of the oil .
it shows a concept of what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
so , the first thing is , it &apos;s a design of the netherlands -- or it was it .
the last fall had to sign it up , because it was hacked .
somebody was hacked and had a lot of encouraging the system .
and last week in a meeting with dutch tv , i asked one of the senior of these group to be able to get it to the point of the person who had been killed because of the most powerful people died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how do people die in a very deep way ?
so , it &apos;s a very important one .
they sell them to the rescue .
what do you do with the firing ?
now , a certificate requires if you have a website with a little bit of a car , with a drug disorder , for example .
now we &apos;re using all of them , or many of us , or a half of our competitors , but these services are particularly prevalent in the u.s. states like iran , where the cites are using the other people who are in their conversation , because they know
but you can do it if you &apos;re in a foreign foreign .
and the fake chocolate system and fake the fake is cool .
and that &apos;s the case of the most of the time .
how about the arab spring and the things that are happening for example ?
now , in egypt , the declaration of the declaration of the april in april , the south headquarters of the egyptian , the egyptian economy , and they found a lot of records .
in these records , a folder called &quot; the &quot; aw &quot; system .
and in this folder , notes were a lot of notes in germany who had sold the egyptian government , which they had a few programs that they were able to do -- in very large frame -- all of communications in the egyptian citizens .
they had sold this program for humberto euros to the egyptian government .
the most important thing is that there &apos;s right here .
so western governments are supporting governments with the food supply , so that they can do the against their own citizens .
but western governments are also helping themselves .
for example , a couple of weeks ago , the so-called so-called , a second of the so-called , that was a horse opera , which was used by german ghraib to be used to their own citizens .
if you &apos;re being respected in a corporate broadcast , then with certain security , you will be the phone frontal lobes .
but today we are far beyond .
they tap their internet connection .
they use tools like the most powerful to put their computer with a child medal , which allows them to monitor their entire communication , their own , to collect their own , to collect their own .
so if we think about these things , the obvious answer of people would be , &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a good citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry .
i don &apos;t hide anything . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
privacy has to be given .
privacy is not about the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we today , in 2011 , our governments may be trusting , but they &apos;re all right that we &apos;re going to get to forever .
and we trust , trust , we &apos;re blind one of any future government , a government that we may have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to address the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of the ted project .
the first one is made , and the first thing that we were doing was , you know , the first one , and the first idea of a simple idea : 3d units from cement , which fit up .
so , the very fast thing is , the most sophisticated species in the world were very quickly in the world .
they put us in the position to build things bigger than we were , buildings , bridges , a rock after the other .
essentially , the most important thing was the building block of our time .
almost hundreds of years later , in 1947 , lego came along with this .
it &apos;s called &quot; automatically , &quot; called the &quot; automatically . &quot;
and within less years , lego moved into every household .
it &apos;s estimated that over 400 billion stones were produced -- or 75 stones for every person on this planet .
you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it possible for all of you .
lego basically has the most powerful , the building block of the world , and it made a building block for our imagination .
in the same year , in the bell labs , the next revolution , the next building building .
the transistor was a little bit of a plastic , which was to give us a world of static , and the kind of spreading building blocks in a world that was interactive .
as the most important thing , we allow the transistor to build much greater , more complex , more complex , a rock after the other .
but there &apos;s a very big one : the transistor was only for experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept that the building block of our time is for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to make the power of engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing on the street .
let me show you how they work .
and the electronic modules are electronic modules that have specific function .
they &apos;re a lot of plastic , light , clay , engine and sensor .
and the best thing about it is that they connect with magnets .
so you can &apos;t put it wrong .
the stones are the stone .
green is a copy , blue is electricity , pink is input and orange cables .
so everything you have to do is connect a blue and an green one , and you can build a very quickly larger amount of energy .
they add a blue on a green , and they can make light .
you can put a switch between and put a little bit of a tree on it .
take the switch out of a surface , which is here , ring , slice , and you &apos;ve made a little bit of a tree .
put this one on the top for a extra effect , and you &apos;ve made a more open effect .
i &apos;ll stop that .
and the simple play is actually a pretty powerful thing .
instead of programming , you have to program , or more , you know , you have to program , to program you with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to accelerate the red , or slow , just turn on this button and it makes the momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind the world &apos;s book is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world in a mountain pool .
lights , sound , the engines , motors -- should be available .
we have distributed children &apos;s books , and they &apos;re looking at it with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful thing is , how do you start the electronics that you &apos;re around in the lives of life and not learn in school .
like a design of a video , or why the doors of the internet &apos;s office , or how a ipod responds to touch .
we also brought up to be a solar project .
so , for example , we had a designer with no experience in electronic things that started to play with a material as a material .
here we see , with a paper , paper and water bottles , like the hell ...
a few weeks ago , we took a risd , and we gave them some designers that had no technical experience -- just box card , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; make what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a more nuanced ball of water .
but wait , this is really my favorite story .
it &apos;s a crater from play-doh , the fear of the darkness .
for these days , the most important material was a little material , electronics was just another material .
and we want to make this material for all available .
so , it &apos;s open open source .
you can go on the website , all the time , you can download all the time .
we want the world of the creators , the inventor , the contributors , because this world , in which we live , are going to be the interactive world , we heard .
so , you go and start to invent it .
thank you .
